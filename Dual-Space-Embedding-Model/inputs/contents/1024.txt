Nine healthy volunteers were divided into a test group (n = 5) and a control group (n = 4). The test group consumed 3 grams per d of wheat gluten hydrolysate for 6 d, and their NK cell activity and hematological parameters were measured: The same assessments were performed in the control group, which did not receive wheat gluten hydrolysate. In the test group, NK cell activity increased significantly (P = 0.018) after wheat gluten hydrolysate intake. No adverse effects were observed in either group.
