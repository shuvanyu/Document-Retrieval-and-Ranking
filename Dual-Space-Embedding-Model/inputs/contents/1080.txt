Platelet hyperactivity is one of the most important factors responsible for the incidence of cardiovascular disease. There are many nutritive and non-nutritive compounds present in the diet which may affect platelet function in various ways. Recent discovery of anti-platelet factors in plants, vegetables and fruits provides a new dietary means for a long-term strategy to favorably modify human blood platelet activity. This review summarises the effects of these dietary components on human platelet function both in vitro and in vivo.
