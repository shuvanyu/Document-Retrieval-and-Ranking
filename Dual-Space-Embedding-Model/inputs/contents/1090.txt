Taking into consideration genetic damage plays an important role in carcinogenesis, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview on the genotoxic potential of some endodontic compounds currently used in dentistry, such as formocresol, paramonochlorophenol, calcium hydroxide, resin-based sealers, phenolic compounds, chlorhexidine, mineral trioxide aggregate, and others. Some of these compounds appear capable of exerting noxious activity on the genetic material. The action mechanisms are discussed. Therefore, this is an area that warrants investigation since the estimation of risk of these substances with respect to genotoxicity will be added to those used for regulatory purposes in improving oral health and preventing oral carcinogenesis.
