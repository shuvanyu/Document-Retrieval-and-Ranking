INTRODUCTION: An increasing number of people all around the world are turning to the nature by using the natural herbal products in both prophylaxes and treatment of different diseases. Green tea with active chemical ingredients posses diverse pharmacological properties that include anti-inflammatory, anticariogenic, antioxidant and antibacterial effects. AIMS: To assess the possible protective properties of green tea on oral health. METHODS: The researchers used the following measurements: Streptococcus mutans count in saliva and plaque, Salivary and plaque pH values, Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI). The above-mentioned measurements were applied to a sample consists of 25 subjects before and after rinsing with green tea for 5 min (short-term study). While, S. mutans count for saliva and plaque and GBI measurements, this experimental intervention study was carried out in the El-Azhar University dental clinic. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that there was a statistically significant difference among subjects pre- and post-rinsing with 2% green tea for 5 min concerning S. mutans count in saliva and plaque, salivary and plaque pH values and GBI. CONCLUSION: This study supports the effectiveness of local application of green tea as antibacterial and anticariogenic material as it decreases the acidity of the saliva and plaque, so it is a cost-effective caries prevention measures especially in developing countries. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
