Anti-Gal is a natural Ab abundantly produced in humans. It interacts specifically with the carbohydrate epitope Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R (termed the alpha-galactosyl epitope). This epitope is expressed in large amounts on thyrocytes of nonprimate mammals, but not of humans. We have previously found that binding of anti-Gal to alpha-galactosyl epitopes on porcine thyrocytes results in stimulatory effects similar to those exerted by thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that anti-Gal may contribute to Graves' disease (GD) pathogenesis by stimulation of the thyrocytes of patients with this autoimmune disorder. Anti-Gal binding and stimulatory effects were assessed in primary thyrocyte cultures. Anti-Gal specifically bound to GD thyrocytes and induced an increase in cAMP synthesis, 125I uptake, and DNA synthesis in these cells. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of autologous sera on GD thyrocytes were greatly reduced after specific depletion of anti-Gal from these sera. No binding and no stimulatory effects of anti-Gal were observed, however, with normal human thyrocytes and with thyrocytes from thyrotoxic patients who lack thyroid-stimulating Igs or thyrotropin binding inhibiting Igs. These in vitro stimulatory effects of anti-Gal on GD thyrocytes suggest that this natural Ab may contribute to the in vivo continuous stimulation of thyrocytes in GD patients. The possibility that anti-Gal may stimulate GD thyrocytes via interaction with aberrantly expressed alpha-galactosyl epitopes on the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor is discussed.
