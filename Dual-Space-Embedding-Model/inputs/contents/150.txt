A study was carried out to determine the effect of a low animal protein diet, such as taken by vegetarians, on the risk of urinary stone disease. A nation-wide survey of vegetarians in the UK showed that the prevalence of urinary stone formation is 40-60% of that predicted for a group of individuals taken from the general population and matched for age, sex and social class with the vegetarians. The findings support the hypothesis that a diet low in animal protein reduces the risk of urinary stone formation.
