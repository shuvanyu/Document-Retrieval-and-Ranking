Diet may represent a modifiable prostate cancer (CaP) risk factor, but a vegetable-based prostate-healthy diet is a major change for most men. We used a ratio of animal:vegetable proteins (A:V ratio) to evaluate whether a comprehensive dietary change was self-sustaining following completion of 11 weekly dietary and cooking classes that integrated mindfulness training (MT). Thirty-six men with recurring CaP were randomized to the intervention or wait-list control. Assessments were at baseline, three months and six months. Of the 17 men randomized to the intervention, 14 completed the requirements. Nineteen were randomized to control and 17 completed requirements. Compared to controls, a significant post-intervention (3 months) decrease in A:V ratio in the intervention group (p=.01) was self-maintained 3 months post-intervention (p=0.049). At each assessment, the A:V ratio was correlated with lycopene, fiber, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol; four dietary components linked to clinically relevant outcomes in CaP. Change in A:V ratio was also significantly correlated with changes in fiber, saturated fat and dietary cholesterol intake. Participants reported regular MT practice and there was a significant correlation between MT practice and changes in both initiation and maintenance of the change in the A:V ratio. These pilot results provide encouraging evidence for the feasibility of a dietary program that includes MT in supporting dietary change for men with recurrent CaP and invite further study to explore the possible role of MT as a means of supporting both initiation of dietary changes and maintenance of those changes over time.
