INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether men with erectile dysfunction (ED) ultimately die of cardiovascular (CV) causes. AIM: This study examined the causes of death in men with ED and their risk of CV death. METHODS: Based on statutory death registrations and hospital morbidity data, the risk of CV death in men with ED in a linked-data study was assessed against the CV mortality risk in a reference male population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths from CV causes as proportions of all deaths. Age-specific rate, mortality rate ratio (MRR), standardized mortality rate ratio (SMRR), and adjusted hazard ratio (HR). RESULTS: CV mortality was 4.0%. Compared with the reference population, the risk of CV death was higher in men with ED (SMRR 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6, 3.0). Risk of CV mortality was higher in men with CV disease prior to ED (adjusted HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.6) or with history of hospital admissions for CV events (adjusted HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3, 3.8), compared with those without the respective history. MRR was significantly increased in the 40-69 years age group (MRR 4.1; 95% CI 3.2, 5.2). The median time interval between manifestation of ED and CV death was 10.0 years. A greater proportion of deaths from oncological than from CV causes (25.0% vs. 10.8%) occurred within the first 5 years of the manifestation of ED. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of CV mortality is greater in men with ED, almost as many men die of oncological as of CV causes, with a higher proportion of oncological deaths occurring sooner subsequent to the first manifestation of ED.
