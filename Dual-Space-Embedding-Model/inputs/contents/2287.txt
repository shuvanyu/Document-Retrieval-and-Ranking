A double blind crossover trial of the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine in painful benign breast disease is reported. Twenty-nine women with cyclical mastalgia and 11 with non-cyclical pain were treated with bromocriptine, 5 mg daily, and placebo over six menstrual cycels. Assessment of response to treatment was made by a linear analogue system and clinical examination together with plasma prolactin estimations. Bromocriptine produced a significant improvement in breast symptoms and a significant fall in prolactin levels in the cyclical pain group, but had no effect in the non-cyclical group. These results suggest that bromocriptine offers a new and effective approach in the management of cyclical breast pain.
