The Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MMDQ) was completed by thirty healthy premenopausal women randomized into one of two sets of weight-maintaining diets, those with a ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P/S ratio) of 1.0 and those with a P/S ratio of 0.3. After a baseline interval of one menstrual cycle, both groups were fed a high fat diet (40% energy from fat) for four menstrual cycles per subject, followed by a similar interval on a low fat diet (20% energy from fat). There were no significant differences in self-reported menstrual symptoms between the two P/S groups. During both menses and the premenstrual week of the low fat dietary period there were significant decreases in self-reported symptoms associated with water retention. A decrease in symptoms in the group labelled "arousal" during the rest of the menstrual cycle was also reported.
