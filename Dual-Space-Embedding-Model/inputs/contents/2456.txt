BACKGROUND: Oral health care professionals can play an important role in preventing oral cancer by performing oral mucosal examinations to detect pre-cancerous changes and by educating patients about oral cancer prevention strategies, including dietary approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports a diet high in fruits, vegetables and plant-based foods for prevention of oral cancer. Dietary supplements-including vitamins and minerals-have not been shown to be effective as substitutes for a diet high in fruits and vegetables. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In addition to discussing tobacco and alcohol use with patients (and, if relevant, betel nut and gutka consumption), as well as the risk of sexual transmission of human papillo-mavirus, clinicians should provide dietary advice for the prevention of oral cancer as part of routine patient education practices.
