Yersinia enterocolitica is a zoonotic agent that causes gastrointestinal disease in humans, as well as reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum. Enteropathogenic Yersinia are the etiological agents for yersiniosis, which can be acquired through the consumption of contaminated foods. As porcine animals are the main carriers of Y. enterocolitica, food safety measures to minimize human infection are of increasing interest to the scientific and medical community. In this review, we examine why it is imperative that information on the reservoirs, prevalence, virulence, and ability of this pathogen to survive in different environments is further investigated to provide rational measures to prevent or decrease associated disease risks.
