Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) have each been associated with premenopausal breast cancer risks. We analyzed data from a cross-sectional study of 261 premenopausal Japanese women aged 20-54 yr with adequate nutritional status to evaluate the relationships between concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in serum and dietary intakes of soy, fats and other nutrients. Diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. There was no significant correlation between soy product as well as soy isoflavone intake and serum IGF-1 or IGFBP-3 levels after controlling for age, total energy, percent body fat, and education level. Total fat intake was significantly inversely correlated with serum IGFBP-3 level (r = -0.13, P = 0.04). The correlations of saturated and monounsaturated fats with serum IGFBP-3 were of borderline significance (r = -0.12, P = 0.06 and r = -0.11, P = 0.07, respectively).
