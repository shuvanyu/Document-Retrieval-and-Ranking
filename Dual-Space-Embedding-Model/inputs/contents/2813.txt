We present a case of a critically ill infant with severe multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and bacteremia who was treated with garlic and antibiotics after in vitro demonstration of a change in the resistance pattern via the disc diffusion method on garlic-treated Mueller Hinton agar. To our knowledge, this is the first report of therapeutic garlic use in a critically ill infant in the literature.
