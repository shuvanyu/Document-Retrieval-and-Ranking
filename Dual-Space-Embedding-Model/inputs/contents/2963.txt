The incidence of neonatal vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency because of maternal deficiency was determined by surveying state newborn screening programs. Thirty-two infants with nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency were identified (0.88/100,000 newborns). Pregnant women should be assessed for their risk of inadequate intake/malabsorption of vitamin B12.
