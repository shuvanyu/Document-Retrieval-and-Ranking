OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between green tea consumption and tooth loss. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Ohsaki Cohort 2006 Study. Usable self-administered questionnaires about green tea consumption and tooth loss were returned from 25,078 persons (12,019 men and 13,059 women) aged 40 to 64 years in Japan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for tooth loss using 3 cut-off points of 10, 20, and 25 teeth relative to each category of green tea consumption. RESULTS: Consumption of > or = 1 cup/day of green tea was significantly associated with decreased odds for tooth loss, and the association appeared to fit a threshold model. In men, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for tooth loss with a cut-off point of <20 teeth associated with different frequencies of green tea consumption were 1.00 (reference) for <1 cup/day, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.91) for 1-2 cups/day, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92) for 3-4 cups/day, and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.89) for > or = 5 cups/day. The corresponding data for women and the results for cut-off points of 10 and 25 teeth were essentially the same. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate an association of green tea consumption with decreased odds for tooth loss. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
