The thermal stability of virulent hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) was compared. Fecal suspensions of virus were heated to temperatures between 45 degrees C and 70 degrees C, and residual infectivity was determined in a cell culture system that was permissive for both viruses. Although HEV was less stable than was HAV, some HEV would most likely survive the internal temperatures of rare-cooked meat.
