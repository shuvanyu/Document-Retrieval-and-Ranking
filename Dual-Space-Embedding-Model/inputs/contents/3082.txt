Clinical and ecological evidence supporting an association between human papillomavirus (HPV)-related tumors and dietary factors are presented. Abstinence from high intake of fried pork (600-1,000 g/day) was associated with regression of an urethral condyloma in a healthy 19-year-old man treated with interferon gamma. International correlations suggest that pork intake is positively associated with incidence of cervical cancer, a disease also related to HPV. Pork meat or dietary factors associated with pork meat consumption may be involved in the development of HPV-related diseases.
