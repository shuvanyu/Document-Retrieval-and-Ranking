The use of over-the-counter supplements is commonplace in today's health conscious society. We present an unusual case of intrahepatic cholestasis caused by vitamin A intoxication. The patient consumed one Herbalife shake with two multivitamin tablets of the same brand for 12 years. When calculated this equated to more than the recommended daily allowance for vitamin A consumption. Deranged liver function tests were consistent with a cholestatic process. Liver biopsy was obtained and revealed features pathognomonic of vitamin A toxicity, without the usual fibrosis. When the supplements were ceased, his jaundice and alkaline phosphatase completely normalized. This case highlights the importance of health care providers documenting non-prescribed dietary supplements and considering them in the etiology of cholestatic liver disease.
