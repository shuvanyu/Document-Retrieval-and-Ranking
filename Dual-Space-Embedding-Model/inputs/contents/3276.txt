OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a novel coconut-derived emulsion (CDE) shampoo against head lice infestation in children. DESIGN: A school trial in which pupils were treated on days 0 and 7 and checked on days 8 and 15 and a family trial where product was applied by parents three times in 2 weeks or used as a cosmetic shampoo and checked on days 14 and days 70. SETTING: UK schools in Bristol and Western-super-Mare and families in Northern Somerset. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Numbers of children free from infestation after treatment. RESULTS: In the school trial, percentage cures at day 8 were 14% (permethrin, n=7) and 61% (CDE, n=37). In the family trial where all family members were treated, cure rate was 96% (n=28), and if the shampoo was subsequently used as a cosmetic shampoo, only 1 of 12 children became re-infested after 10 weeks. CONCLUSION: CDE shampoo is a novel effective method of controlling head lice and used after treatment as a cosmetic shampoo can aid in the reduction of re-infestation.
