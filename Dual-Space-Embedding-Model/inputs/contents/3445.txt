The effect of a mixed Western, high meat diet or a nonmeat diet on the intestinal bacterial beta-glucuronidase activity was studied in human volunteers. This enzyme was significantly higher in stools of subjects on a high meat diet as compared to the nonmeat regimen. Thus, intestinal flora of subjects on a high meat diet was more able to hydrolyze glucuronide conjugates than that of individuals on a nonmeat diet. This, in turn, may raise the amount of substances, such as carcinogens, within the colonic lumen.
