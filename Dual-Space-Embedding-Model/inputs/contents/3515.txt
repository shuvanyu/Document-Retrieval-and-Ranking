OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of postprandial lipid changes on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after a high-fat meal. METHODS: We studied 50 CAD patients and 25 control participants, who were all normocholesterolemic. Flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery was evaluated by the high-resolution ultrasound technique before and after a single high-fat meal (800 calories; 50 g fat). RESULTS: Postprandial serum triglyceride level increased significantly at 2-7 h and mean flow-mediated vasodilatation was impaired significantly (from 4.22 +/- 0.44 to 2.75 +/- 0.33%, P < 0.01) for 75 subjects. The increment in 2 h serum triglyceride level correlated positively with the decrement in postprandial flow-mediated vasodilatation (r = 0.459, P < 0.01). Postprandial triglyceride level was significantly higher in CAD patients than in control participants. Flow-mediated vasodilatation was significantly impaired in CAD patients (from 3.04 +/- 0.39 to 1.69 +/- 0.23%, P < 0.01) and control participants (from 6.58 +/- 0.52 to 4.87 +/- 0.19%, P < 0.05) after a high-fat meal. The impairment of flow-mediated dilatation was more severe in CAD patients (44.41%) than in control participants (25.99%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Postprandial endothelium-dependent vasodilatation after a single high-fat meal was severely impaired in normocholesterolemic CAD patients and control participants. The disordered postprandial metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may play an atherogenic role by inducing endothelial dysfunction.
