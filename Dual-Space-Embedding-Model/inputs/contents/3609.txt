Chinese wild rice has been consumed for over 3000 years, but its safety as a food in China has never been established. The grain contains higher amounts of protein, ash and crude fibre than white rice. Levels of non-nutritive mineral elements such as arsenic, cadmium and lead are very low. The eating patterns of 110 people ( > 60 yr) showed no ill-effects. The results of acute toxicity tests with mice fed diet containing 21.5 g/kg Chinese wild rice [corrected] indicated no abnormal reaction and none of the mice died. The bone marrow micronucleus and sperm abnormality tests conducted with mice were negative as was the Salmonella mutagenicity test. The results of this investigation indicate that Chinese wild rice is safe for human consumption.
