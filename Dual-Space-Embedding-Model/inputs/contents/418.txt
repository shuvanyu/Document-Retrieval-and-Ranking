The calcium ion (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous second messenger that is crucial for the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes. The diverse transient signals transduced by Ca2+ are mediated by intracellular Ca2+-binding proteins, also known as Ca2+ sensors. A key obstacle to studying many Ca2+-sensing proteins is the difficulty in identifying the numerous downstream target interactions that respond to Ca2+-induced conformational changes. Among a number of Ca2+ sensors in the eukaryotic cell, calmodulin (CaM) is the most widespread and the best studied. Employing the mRNA display technique, we have scanned the human proteome for CaM-binding proteins and have identified and characterized a large number of both known and previously uncharacterized proteins that interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The interactions of several identified proteins with Ca2+/CaM were confirmed by using pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Many of the CaM-binding proteins identified belong to protein families such as the DEAD/H box proteins, ribosomal proteins, proteasome 26S subunits, and deubiquitinating enzymes, suggesting the possible involvement of Ca2+/CaM in different signaling pathways. The selection method described herein could be used to identify the binding partners of other calcium sensors on the proteome-wide scale.
