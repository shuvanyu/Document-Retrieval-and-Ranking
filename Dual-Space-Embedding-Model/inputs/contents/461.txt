White rice-based foods, which are high in refined carbohydrates, are widely consumed in China. A case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between white rice-based food consumption and the risk of ischemic stroke in the southern Chinese population. Information on diet and lifestyle was obtained from 374 incident ischemic stroke patients and 464 hospital-based controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effects of rice-based foods on stroke risk. The mean weekly intake of rice foods appeared to be significantly higher in cases than in controls. Increased consumptions of cooked rice, congee, and rice noodle were associated with a higher risk for ischemic stroke after controlling for confounding factors. The corresponding adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for the highest versus lowest intake level were 2.73 (1.31-5.69), 2.93 (1.68-5.13), and 2.03 (1.40-2.94), with significant dose-response relationships observed. The results provide evidence of a positive association between habitual rice food consumption and the risk of ischemic stroke in Chinese adults. Copyright Â© 2010 National Stroke Association.
