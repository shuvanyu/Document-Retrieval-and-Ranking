An extensive body of literature illustrates that flaxseed has gained a significant position in the domain of nutritional sciences owing to its pivotal role as an antioxidant agent. The review discusses at length, numerous health benefits of flaxseed typically focusing its preventive role against cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and enhancement of spatial memory. Massive increase in the size of population with a special emphasize to the developing countries, there is an urge for exploration of the alternative dietary resources that can meet the dietary and nutritional needs of forthcoming generations. With respect to its remarkable nutritional importance, the review in question enables researchers engaged in nutritional sciences to further investigate the therapeutic value of flaxseed functional components and their dietary application in various food products and availability in processed foods as well as in the human cell line.
