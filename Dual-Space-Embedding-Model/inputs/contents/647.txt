Background “Cardiovascular health” is a new construct defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of its 2020 Impact Goals definition. The applicability of this construct to community-based populations and the distributions of its components by race and sex have not been reported. Methods and Results The AHA construct of “cardiovascular health” and the AHA “ideal health behaviors index” and “ideal health factors index” were evaluated among 1933 participants (mean age 59 years; 44% blacks; 66% female) in the community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation study. One of 1933 participants (0.1%) met all 7 components of the AHA's definition of ideal cardiovascular health. Less than 10% of participants met ≥5 components of ideal cardiovascular health in all subgroups (by race, sex, age and income level). Thirty-nine subjects (2.0%) had all four components of the ideal health behaviors index and 27 (1.4%) had all three components of the ideal health factors index. Blacks had significantly fewer ideal cardiovascular health components than whites (2.0±1.2 vs. 2.6±1.4, p<0.001). After adjustment by sex, age and income level, blacks had 82% lower odds of having ≥5 components of ideal cardiovascular health (Odds Ratio 0.18, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=0.10-0.34, p<0.001). No interaction was found between race and sex. Conclusion The prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health is extremely low in a middle-age community-based study population. Comprehensive individual and population-based interventions must be developed to support the attainment of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals for cardiovascular health.
