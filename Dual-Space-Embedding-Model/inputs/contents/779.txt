Cardiovascular disease prevention is of high priority in developed countries. Healthy eating habits including the regular intake of an antithrombotic diet (fruit and vegetables) may contribute to prevention. Platelet function is a critical factor in arterial thrombosis and the effect strawberries have is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically examine the action of strawberries in preventing platelet activation and thrombus formation. Strawberry extract concentration-dependently (0.1-1 mg/ml) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP and arachidonic acid. At the same concentrations as strawberry inhibits platelet aggregation, it significantly decreased sP-selectin, sCD40L, RANTES, and IL-1β levels. The strawberry may exert significant protective effects on thromboembolic-related disorders by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Also, this suggests that antithrombotic activity may have novel anti-inflammatory effects.
