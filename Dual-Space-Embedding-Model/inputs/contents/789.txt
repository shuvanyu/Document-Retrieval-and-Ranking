Summary Objectives The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Figitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody against IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Methods This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00603538) assessed the safety and tolerability of figitumumab (6, 10 and 20 mg/kg) in combination with carboplatin (area under the curve: 6 mg·min/mL) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) in Japanese patients (N = 19) with chemotherapy-naïve, advanced NSCLC. Treatments were administered intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for four to six cycles. Pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and antitumor activity were also evaluated. Results Figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated at doses up to 20 mg/kg; no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at this dose level. When given in combination, figitumumab plasma exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. The approximate 2-fold accumulation following repeated administration supported the 21-day regimen as appropriate for figitumumab administration. Serum total IGF-1 and IGF binding protein-3 concentrations increased following figitumumab dosing, but a clear dose-dependent relationship was not demonstrated. Seven of 18 evaluable patients experienced a partial response. Conclusions Figitumumab 20 mg/kg in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated in chemotherapy-naïve Japanese patients with NSCLC. Further analysis of biomarker data is necessary for the development of figitumumab therapy.
