We studied 19 male patients with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia, a control group of 28 healthy men and 44 infertile males before any treatment was undertaken. Spermiogram, seminal biochemical studies, measurements of plasma hormone levels and lipid determinations were carried out. Most hyperlipoproteinaemic patients showed abnormalities in the spermiograms and the mean values were lower than in the controls except for semen volume. Seminal biochemical determinations were normal in the majority and the hormone profile showed some abnormal values, mainly for E2. Lipid abnormalities were more common in azoospermic infertile men and mean lipid levels were higher. Correlation studies suggest that high levels of C and/or Tg are associated with poor semen quality and higher FSH levels. The results of our studies suggest that high lipid levels exert adverse direct effects at the testicular level.
