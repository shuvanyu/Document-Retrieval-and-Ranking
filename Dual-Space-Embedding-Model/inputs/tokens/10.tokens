objective meat and milk products are important sources of dietary phosphorus p and proteinthe use of p additives is common both in processed cheese and meat productsmeasurement of inÂ vitro digestible phosphorus dp content of foods may reflect absorbability of p the objective of this study was to measure both total phosphorus tp and dp contents of selected meat and milk products and to compare amounts of tp and dp and the proportion of dp to tp among different foodsmethods tp and dp contents of 21 meat and milk products were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoesin dp analysis samples were digested enzymatically in principle in the same way as in the alimentary canal before the analysesthe most popular national brands of meat and milk products were chosen for analysisresults the highest tp and dp contents were found in processed and hard cheeses the lowest in milk and cottage cheesetp and dp contents in sausages and cold cuts were lower than those in cheeseschicken pork beef and rainbow trout contained similar amounts of tp but slightly more variation was found in their dp contentsconclusions foods containing p additives have a high content of dpour study confirms that cottage cheese and unenhanced meats are better choices than processed or hard cheeses sausages and cold cuts for chronic kidney disease patients based on their lower ptoprotein ratios and sodium contentsthe results support previous findings of better p absorbability in foods of animal origin than in for example legumescopyright  2012 national kidney foundation incpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
