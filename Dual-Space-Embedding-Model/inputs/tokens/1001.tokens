summary prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia based on glycaemic parameters above normal but below diabetes thresholds is a high risk state for diabetes with an annualized conversion rate of 510 with similar proportion converting back to normoglycaemiathe prevalence of prediabetes is increasing worldwide and it is projected that 470 million people will have prediabetes in 2030prediabetes is associated with the simultaneous presence of insulin resistance and Î²cell dysfunction abnormalities that start before glucose changes are detectableobservational evidence shows associations of prediabetes with early forms of nephropathy chronic kidney disease small fibre neuropathy diabetic retinopathy and increased risk of macrovascular diseasemultifactorial risk scores could optimize the estimation of diabetes risk using noninvasive parameters and bloodbased metabolic traits in addition to glycaemic valuesfor prediabetic individuals lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention with evidence of a 4070 relative risk reductionaccumulating data also suggests potential benefits from pharmacotherapy
