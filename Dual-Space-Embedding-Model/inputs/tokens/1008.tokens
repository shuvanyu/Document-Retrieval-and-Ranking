background people with diabetes can suffer from diverse complications that seriously erode quality of lifediabetes costing the united states more than 174 billion per year in 2007 is expected to take an increasingly large financial toll in subsequent yearsaccurate projections of diabetes burden are essential to policymakers planning for future health care needs and costsmethods using data on prediabetes and diabetes prevalence in the united states forecasted incidence and current us census projections of mortality and migration the authors constructed a series of dynamic models employing systems of difference equations to project the future burden of diabetes among us adultsa threestate model partitions the us population into no diabetes undiagnosed diabetes and diagnosed diabetesa fourstate model divides the state of no diabetes into highrisk prediabetes and lowrisk normal glucose statesa fivestate model incorporates an intervention designed to prevent or delay diabetes in adults at high riskresults the authors project that annual diagnosed diabetes incidence new cases will increase from about 8 cases per 1000 in 2008 to about 15 in 2050assuming low incidence and relatively high diabetes mortality total diabetes prevalence diagnosed and undiagnosed cases is projected to increase from 14 in 2010 to 21 of the us adult population by 2050however if recent increases in diabetes incidence continue and diabetes mortality is relatively low prevalence will increase to 33 by 2050a middleground scenario projects a prevalence of 25 to 28 by 2050intervention can reduce but not eliminate increases in diabetes prevalenceconclusions these projected increases are largely attributable to the aging of the us population increasing numbers of members of higherrisk minority groups in the population and people with diabetes living longereffective strategies will need to be undertaken to moderate the impact of these factors on national diabetes burdenour analysis suggests that widespread implementation of reasonably effective preventive interventions focused on highrisk subgroups of the population can considerably reduce but not eliminate future increases in diabetes prevalence
