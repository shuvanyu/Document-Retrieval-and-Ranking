objective to investigate the association of wholeblood fatty acids and reported intakes of fats with risk of prostate cancer pcadesign casecontrol study of 209 men 4080 years old with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 226 cancerfree men attending the same urology clinicswholeblood fatty acid composition mol was measured by gas chromatography and diet assessed by food frequency questionnaireresults high wholeblood oleic acid composition tertile 3 vs tertile 1 or 037 ci 0140098 and moderate palmitic acid proportions tertile 2 or 029 ci 012070 tertile 3 or 053 ci 019154 were inversely related to risk of pca whereas men with high linolenic acid proportions were at increased likelihood of pca tertile 3 vs tertile 1 or 206 129327blood myristic stearic and palmitoleic acids were not associated with pcahigher intakes of dietary mufa were inversely related to prostate cancer tertile 3 vs tertile 1 or 039 ci 016092the principal source of dietary mufa was avocado intakedietary intakes of other fats were not associated with pcaconclusions wholeblood and dietary mufa reduced the risk of prostate cancerthe association may be related to avocado intakeshigh blood linolenic acid was directly related to prostate cancerthese associations warrant further investigation
