eisenbergs helical hydrophobic moment less than mu h greater than algorithm was applied to the analysis of the primary structure of amphipathic alphahelical peptide hormones and an optimal method for identifying other peptides of this class determinedwe quantitate and compare known amphipathic helical peptide hormones with a second group of peptides with proven nonamphipathic properties and determine the best method of distinguishing between themthe respective means of the maximum 11 residue less than mu h greater than for the amphipathic helical and control peptides were 046 007 and 033 007 p  0004to better reflect the amphipathic potential of the entire peptide the percent of 11 residue segments in each peptide above a particular less than mu h greater than was plotted vs less than mu h greater thanthe resulting curves are referred to as hmcthe mean hmc of the two groups was highly significantly different such that the hmc method was superior to others in its ability to distinguish amphipathic from nonamphipathic peptidesseveral potential new members of this structural class were identified using this approachmolecular modeling of a portion of one of these prolactin inhibitory factor reveals a strongly amphipathic alpha helix at residues 421this computerbased method may enable rapid identification of peptides of the amphipathic alphahelix class
