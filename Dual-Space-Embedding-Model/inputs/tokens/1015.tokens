background impaired glucose tolerance igt and impaired fasting glucose ifg are prediabetic states treatment of which may prevent or delay the onset of overt diabetes and thus potentially reduce major cardiovascular cv eventswe therefore sought to determine whether interventions including diet exercise and pharmacological therapy altered allcause and cardiovascular related mortality in such subjectsmethods we performed a metaanalysis of prospective randomised controlled trials rcts that were identified in the medical literature and databasestrials were eligible for inclusion if they reported allcause mortality rates at a minimum recruited approximately 100 patients and had a minimum followup of one yearinterventions were divided into pharmacological and nonpharmacologicalresults ten rcts that enrolled 23152 patients met the above entry criteriatrials ran for an average of 375 yearsdiabetes was delayed or prevented by these interventions vs control risk ratio 083 95ci 080086nondrug approaches n  3495 were superior to drugbased approaches n  20872 in diabetes prevention 052 046058 vs 070 058085 p  005there was no difference in risk of allcause mortality in the intervention versus control group 096 084110 and no difference in cv death 104 061178there was a nonsignificant trend towards reduction in fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction 059 023150fatal and nonfatal stroke was borderline reduced 076 058099 with intervention versus controlconclusions despite interventions being mostly successful in retarding progression to overt diabetes this did not result in reductions in allcause or cardiovascular mortality or myocardial infarction with the possible exception of stroke
