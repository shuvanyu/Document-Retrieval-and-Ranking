objective wheat fiber appears to protect from cardiovascular disease despite its lack of consistent effect on serum lipidswe therefore wished to determine whether reported inconsistencies in the effect of wheat bran resulted from differences in particle size or its high gluten contentmethods two studies were conductedin onemonth metabolic diets 24 hyperlipidemic subjects consumed breads providing an additional 19 gd dietary fiber as medium or ultrafine wheat bran and extra protein 10 of energy as wheat glutenin twoweek ad libitum diets 24 predominantly normolipidemic subjects consumed breakfast cereals providing an additional 19 gd of dietary fiber as coarse or a mixture of ultrafine and coarse wheat bran with no change in gluten intakeboth studies followed a randomized crossover design with control periods when subjects ate lowfiber breads and cereals respectively with no added glutenfasting blood lipids were measured on day zero and at the end of each phaseresults wheat bran had no effect on total ldl or hdl cholesterol irrespective of particle size or level of gluten in the diethowever consumption of increased gluten in the metabolic study was associated with a 134 reduction in serum triglycerides p  0005 which was not seen in the normalgluten ad libitum studyconclusions the protective effect of wheat fiber in cardiovascular disease cannot be explained by an effect of wheat bran in reducing serum cholesterol although in hyperlipidemic subjects displacement of carbohydrate by gluten on the highfiber phases was associated with lower serum triglycerides
