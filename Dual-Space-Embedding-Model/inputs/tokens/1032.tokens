a large national investigation into the extent of gluten crosscontamination of naturally glutenfree ingredients flours and starches sold in canada was performedsamples n  640 were purchased from eight canadian cities and via the internet during the period 20102012 and analysed for gluten contaminationthe results showed that 61 of the 640 95 samples were contaminated above the codexrecommended maximum level for glutenfree products 20 mg kg¹ with a range of 57995 mg kg¹for the ingredients that were labelled glutenfree the contamination range 5141 mg kg¹ and number of samples were lower 3 of 268this picture was consistent over time with approximately the same percentage of samples above 20 mg kg¹ in both the initial set and the subsequent lotlooking at the total mean composite contamination for specific ingredients the largest and most consistent contaminations come from higher fibre ingredients such as soy 902 mg kg¹ millet 272 mg kg¹ and buckwheat 153 mg kg¹of the naturally glutenfree flours and starches tested that do not contain a glutenfree label the higher fibre ingredients would constitute the greatest probability of being contaminated with gluten above 20 mg kg¹
