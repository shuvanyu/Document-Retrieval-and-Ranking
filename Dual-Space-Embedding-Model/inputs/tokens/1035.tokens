objectives nonceliac wheat sensitivity ws is considered a new clinical entityan increasing percentage of the general population avoids gluten ingestionhowever the real existence of this condition is debated and specific markers are lackingour aim was thus to demonstrate the existence of ws and define its clinical serologic and histological markersmethods we reviewed the clinical charts of all subjects with an irritable bowel syndrome ibslike presentation who had been diagnosed with ws using a doubleblind placebocontrolled dbpc challenge in the years 20012011one hundred celiac disease cd patients and fifty ibs patients served as controlsresults two hundred and seventysix patients with ws as diagnosed by dbpc challenge were includedtwo groups showing distinct clinical characteristics were identified ws alone group 1 and ws associated with multiple food hypersensitivity group 2as a whole group the ws patients showed a higher frequency of anemia weight loss selfreported wheat intolerance coexistent atopy and food allergy in infancy than the ibs controlsthere was also a higher frequency of positive serum assays for iggiga antigliadin and cytometric basophil activation in in vitro assaythe main histology characteristic of ws patients was eosinophil infiltration of the duodenal and colon mucosapatients with ws alone were characterized by clinical features very similar to those found in cd patientspatients with multiple food sensitivity were characterized by clinical features similar to those found in allergic patientsconclusions our data confirm the existence of nonceliac ws as a distinct clinical conditionwe also suggest the existence of two distinct populations of subjects with ws one with characteristics more similar to cd and the other with characteristics pointing to food allergy
