background a significant percentage of the general population report problems caused by wheat andor gluten ingestion even though they do not have celiac disease cd or wheat allergy wa because they test negative both for cdspecific serology and histopathology and for immunoglobulin e igemediated assaysmost patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms and all report improvement of symptoms on a glutenfree dietthis clinical condition has been named nonceliac gluten sensitivity ncgsaim we attempt to define the current pathogenic clinical and diagnostic criteria of this new disease to provide a practical view that might be useful to evaluate diagnose and manage ncgs patientsmethods we reviewed the international literature through pubmed and medline using the search terms wheat hypersensitivity wheat allergy wheat intolerance gluten hypersensitivity and gluten intolerance and we discuss current knowledge about ncgsresults it has been demonstrated that patients suffering from ncgs are a heterogeneous group composed of several subgroups each characterized by different pathogenesis clinical history and probably clinical coursencgs diagnosis can be reached only by excluding cd and warecent evidence shows that a personal history of food allergy in infancy coexistent atopy positive for immunoglobulin g igg antigliadin antibodies and flow cytometric basophil activation test with wheat and duodenal andor ileumcolon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts could be useful to identify ncgs patientsconclusions future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for ncgs diagnosis and to better define the different ncgs subgroupskey teaching points  most patients report both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms and all agree that there is an improvement of symptoms on a glutenfree diet ncgs diagnosis can be reached only by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy patients suffering from ncgs are a heterogeneous group composed of several subgroups each characterized by different pathogenesis clinical history and probably clinical course a personal history of food allergy in infancy coexistent atopy positive igg antigliadin antibodies aga and flow cytometric basophil activation test with wheat and duodenal andor ileumcolon intraepithelial and lamina propria eosinophil counts could be useful to identify ncgs patients future research should aim to identify reliable biomarkers for ncgs diagnosis and to better define the different ncgs subgroup
