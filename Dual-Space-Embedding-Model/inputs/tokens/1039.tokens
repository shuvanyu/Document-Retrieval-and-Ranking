the prevalence of allergicrelated diseases food intolerance and chemical sensitivities in both the pediatric and adult population has increased dramatically over the last two decades with escalating rates of associated morbidityconditions of acquired allergy food intolerance and chemical hypersensitivity are frequently the direct sequelae of a toxicant induced loss of tolerance tilt in response to a significant initiating toxic exposurefollowing the primary toxicant insult the individuals become sensitive to low levels of diverse and unrelated triggers in their environment such as commonly encountered chemical inhalant or food antigensamong sensitized individuals exposure to assorted inciting stimuli may precipitate diverse clinical andor immune sequelae as may be evidenced by clinical symptoms as well as varied lymphocyte antibody or cytokine responses in some casesrecently recognized as a mechanism of disease development tilt and resultant sensitivityrelated illness sri may involve various organ systems and evoke wideranging physical or neuropsychological manifestationswith escalating rates of toxicant exposure and bioaccumulation in the populationatlarge an increasing proportion of contemporary illness is the direct result of tilt and ensuing sriavoidance of triggers will preclude symptoms and desensitization immunotherapy or immune suppression may ameliorate symptomatology in some casesresolution of sri generally occurs on a gradual basis following the elimination of bioaccumulated toxicity and avoidance of further initiating adverse environmental exposuresas has usually been the case throughout medical history whenever new evidence regarding disease mechanisms emerges resistance to the translation of knowledge aboundscopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
