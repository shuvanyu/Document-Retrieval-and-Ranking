objectives despite increased prescription of a glutenfree diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a triggerthe aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in nonceliac individuals and to examine the mechanismmethods a doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a glutenfree dietparticipants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a glutenfree diet for up to 6 weekssymptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation injury and immune activation were monitoredresults a total of 34 patients aged 2959 years 4 men completed the study as per protocoloverall 56 had human leukocyte antigen hladq2 andor hladq8adherence to diet and supplements was very highof 19 patients 68 in the gluten group 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared with 6 of 15 40 on placebo p00001 generalized estimating equationon a visual analog scale patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week for overall symptoms p0047 pain p0016 bloating p0031 satisfaction with stool consistency p0024 and tiredness p0001antigliadin antibodies were not inducedthere were no significant changes in fecal lactoferrin levels of celiac antibodies highly sensitive creactive protein or intestinal permeabilitythere were no differences in any end point in individuals with or without dq2dq8conclusions nonceliac gluten intolerance may exist but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated
