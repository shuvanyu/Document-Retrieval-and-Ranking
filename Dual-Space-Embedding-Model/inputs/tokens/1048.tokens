background  aims the prevalence of chronic hepatitis c chc remains high and the complications of infection are commonour goal was to project the future prevalence of chc and its complicationsmethods we developed a multicohort natural history model to overcome limitations of previous models for predicting disease outcomes and benefits of therapyresults prevalence of chc peaked in 2001 at 36 millionfibrosis progression was inversely related to age at infection so cirrhosis and its complications were most common after the age of 60 years regardless of when infection occurredthe proportion of chc with cirrhosis is projected to reach 25 in 2010 and 45 in 2030 although the total number with cirrhosis will peak at 10 million 305 higher than the current level in 2020 and then declinehepatic decompensation and liver cancer will continue to increase for another 10 to 13 yearstreatment of all infected patients in 2010 could reduce risk of cirrhosis decompensation cancer and liverrelated deaths by 16 42 31 and 36 by 2020 given current response rates to antiviral therapyconclusions prevalence of hepatitis c cirrhosis and its complications will continue to increase through the next decade and will mostly affect those older than 60 years of agecurrent treatment patterns will have little effect on these complications but wider application of antiviral treatment and better responses with new agents could significantly reduce the impact of this disease in coming years
