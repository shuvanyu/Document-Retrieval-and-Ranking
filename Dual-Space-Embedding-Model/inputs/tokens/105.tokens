prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among american menearlier diagnosis increases survival rate in patientshowever treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative carethus new methods of treatment and prevention are necessary for inhibiting disease progression to a hormone refractory stateone of the approaches to control prostate cancer is prevention through diet which inhibits one or more neoplastic events and reduces the cancer riskfor centuries ayurveda has recommended the use of bitter melon momordica charantia as a functional food to prevent and treat human health related issuesin this study we have initially used human prostate cancer cells pc3 and lncap as an in vitro model to assess the efficacy of bitter melon extract bme as an anticancer agentwe observed that prostate cancer cells treated with bme accumulate during the s phase of the cell cycle and modulate cyclin d1 cyclin e and p21 expressiontreatment of prostate cancer cells with bme enhanced bax expression and induced polyadpribose polymerase cleavageoral gavage of bme as a dietary compound delayed the progression to high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia pin in tramp transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice 31prostate tissue from bmefed mice displayed 51 reduction of pcna expressiontogether our results suggest for the first time that oral administration of bme inhibits prostate cancer progression in tramp mice by interfering cell cycle progression and proliferation
