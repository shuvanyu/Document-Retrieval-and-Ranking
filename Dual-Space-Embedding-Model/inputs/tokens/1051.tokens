background chlorella a unicellular green alga that grows in fresh water contains high levels of proteins vitamins minerals and dietary fiberssome studies have reported favorable immune functionrelated effects on biological secretions such as blood and breast milk in humans who have ingested a chlorelladerived multicomponent supplementhowever the effects of chlorelladerived supplement on mucosal immune functions remain unclearthe purpose of this study was to investigate whether chlorella ingestion increases the salivary secretory immunoglobulin a siga secretion in humans using a blind randomized crossover study designmethods fifteen men took 30 placebo and 30 chlorella tablets per day for 4 weeks separated by a 12week washout periodbefore and after each trial saliva samples were collected from a sterile cotton ball that was chewed after overnight fastingsalivary siga concentrations were measured using elisaresults compliance rates for placebo and chlorella ingestions were 970  10 and 953  16 respectivelyno difference was observed in salivary siga concentrations before and after placebo ingestion p  038however salivary siga concentrations were significantly elevated after chlorella ingestion compared to baseline p  001no trial  period interaction was identified for the saliva flow ratesalthough the siga secretion rate was not affected by placebo ingestion p  036 it significantly increased after 4week chlorella ingestion than before intake p  001conclusions these results suggest 4week ingestion of a chlorelladerived multicomponent supplement increases salivary siga secretion and possibly improves mucosal immune function in humans
