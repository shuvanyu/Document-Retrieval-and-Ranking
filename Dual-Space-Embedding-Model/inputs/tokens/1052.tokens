background in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that chlorella is a potent biological response modifier on immunityhowever there were no direct evidences for the effect of chlorella supplementation on immuneinflammation response in healthy humansmethods this study was designed for an 8week randomized doubleblinded placebocontrolled trial 5g of chlorella n23 or placebo n28 as form of tabletsmainly cytotoxic activities of natural killer nk cells and serum concentrations of interferonγ interleukin1β and interleukin12 were measuredresults after the 8week serum concentrations of interferonγ p005 and interleukin1β p0001 significantly increased and that of interleukin12 p01 tended to increase in the chlorella groupthe increments of these cytokines after the intervention were significantly bigger in the chlorella group than those in the placebo groupin addition nk cell activities  were significantly increased in chlorella group but not in placebo groupthe increments of nk cell activities  were also significantly bigger in the chlorella group than the placebo groupadditionally changed levels of nk cell activity were positively correlated with those of serum interleukin1β r0280 p0047 and interferonγ r0271 p0005signficantly positive correlations were also observed among the changed levels of serum cytokines between interferonγ and interleukin1β r0448 p0001 between interleukin12 and interleukin1β r0416 p0003 and between interleukin12 and interferonγ r0570 p001conclusion these results may suggest a beneficial immunostimulatory effect of shortterm chlorella supplementation which enhances the nk cell activity and produces interferonγ and interleukin12 as well as interleukin1β the th1 cellinduced cytokines in healthy people
