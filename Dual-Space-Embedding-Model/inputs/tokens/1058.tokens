background chronic diarrhea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom of intolerance of cows milk among childrenon the basis of a prior open study we hypothesized that intolerance of cows milk can also cause severe perianal lesions with pain on defecation and consequent constipation in young childrenmethods we performed a doubleblind crossover study comparing cows milk with soy milk in 65 children age range 11 to 72 months with chronic constipation defined as having one bowel movement every 3 to 15 daysall had been referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic and had previously been treated with laxatives without success 49 had anal fissures and perianal erythema or edemaafter 15 days of observation the patients received cows milk or soy milk for two weeksafter a oneweek washout period the feedings were reverseda response was defined as eight or more bowel movements during a treatment periodresults fortyfour of the 65 children 68 percent had a response while receiving soy milkanal fissures and pain with defecation resolvednone of the children who received cows milk had a responsein all 44 children with a response the response was confirmed with a doubleblind challenge with cows milkchildren with a response had a higher frequency of coexistent rhinitis dermatitis or bronchospasm than those with no response 11 of 44 children vs 1 of 21 p005 they were also more likely to have anal fissures and erythema or edema at base line 40 of 44 vs 9 of 21 p0001 evidence of inflammation of the rectal mucosa on biopsy 26 of 44 vs 5 of 21 p0008 and signs of hypersensitivity such as specific ige antibodies to cowsmilk antigens 31 of 44 vs 4 of 21 p0001conclusions in young children chronic constipation can be a manifestation of intolerance of cows milk
