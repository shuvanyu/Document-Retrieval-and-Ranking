objective to examine daily cows milk consumption and duration of breastfeeding in infants and young children with anal fissure and constipationmethods two groups of 30 consecutive children aged between 4 months and 3 years were evaluated retrospectivelygroup i comprised children with chronic constipation and anal fissure in whom surgical causes were excluded and group ii comprised normal childrenthe daily consumption of cows milk duration of breastfeeding and other clinical features of the children were investigated results the mean daily consumption of cows milk was significantly higher in group i 756 ml range 2001500 ml than group ii 253 ml range 01000 ml p  0001group i children were breastfed for a significantly shorter period 58 months range 018 months than group ii 101 months range 224 months p  0006the odds ratios for the two factors  children consuming more than 200 ml of cows milk per day 25 children in group i 11 children in group ii and breastfeeding for less than 4 months 16 children in group i 5 children in group ii  were calculated to be 86 95 confidence interval ci 023074 p  00005 and 57 95 ci 037066 p  0007 respectivelyconclusions infants and young children with chronic constipation and anal fissure may consume larger amounts of cows milk than children with a normal bowel habitadditionally shorter duration of breastfeeding and early bottle feeding with cows milk may play a role in the development of constipation and anal fissure in infants and young children
