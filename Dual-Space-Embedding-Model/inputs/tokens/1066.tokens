background chronic constipation in children can be caused by cows milk intolerance cmi but its pathogenesis is unknownaims to evaluate the histology and manometry pattern in patients with food intolerancerelated constipationpatients and methods thirtysix consecutive children with chronic constipation were enrolledall underwent an elimination diet and successive doubleblind food challengeall underwent rectal biopsy and anorectal manometryresults a total of 14 patients were found to be suffering from cmi and three from multiple food intolerancethey had a normal stool frequency on elimination diet whereas constipation recurred on food challengethe patients with food intolerance showed a significantly higher frequency of erosions of the mucosa and the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and eosinophilsthe rectal mucous gel layer showed that the foodintolerant patients had a significantly lower thickness of mucus than the other subjects studiedmanometry showed a higher anal sphincter resting pressure and a lower critical volume in food intolerance patients than in the others suffering from constipation unrelated to food intoleranceboth histology and manometry abnormalities disappeared on the elimination dietconclusions food intolerancerelated constipation is characterized by proctitisincreased anal resting pressure and a reduced mucous gel layer can be considered to be contributory factors in the pathogenesis of constipation
