a number of natural compounds with inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis have been identified from our dietseveral studies have documented the cancerpreventive activity of a significant number of isothiocyanates itcs the majority of which occur in plants especially in cruciferous vegetablesthe most characterized itc is sulforaphane sfnsfn has received a great deal of attention because of its ability to simultaneously modulate multiple cellular targets involved in cancer development including i dna protection by modulating carcinogenmetabolizing enzymes and blocking the action of mutagens ii inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis thereby retarding or eliminating clonal expansion of initiated transformed andor neoplastic cells iii inhibition of neoangiogenesis progression of benign tumors to malignant tumors and metastasis formationsfn is therefore able to prevent delay or reverse preneoplastic lesions as well as to act on cancer cells as a therapeutic agenttaking into account this evidence and its favorable toxicological profile sfn can be viewed as a conceptually promising agent in cancer prevention andor therapy
