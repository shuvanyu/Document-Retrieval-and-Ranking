sulforaphane a naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive is the hydrolysis product of glucoraphanin the main glucosinolate in broccolithe hydrolysis requires myrosinase isoenzyme to be present in sufficient activity however processing leads to its denaturation and hence reduced hydrolysisin this study the effect of adding mustard seeds which contain a more resilient isoform of myrosinase to processed broccoli was investigated with a view to intensify the formation of sulforaphanethermal inactivation of myrosinase from both broccoli and mustard seeds was studiedthermal degradation of broccoli glucoraphanin was investigated in addition to the effects of thermal processing on the formation of sulforaphane and sulforaphane nitrilelimited thermal degradation of glucoraphanin less than 12 was observed when broccoli was placed in vacuum sealed bag sous vide and cooked in a water bath at 100c for 8 and 12 minboiling broccoli in water prevented the formation of any significant levels of sulforaphane due to inactivated myrosinasehowever addition of powdered mustard seeds to the heat processed broccoli significantly increased the formation of sulforaphanecrown copyright  2012published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
