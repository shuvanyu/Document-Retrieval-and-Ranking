brassica vegetables contain a diverse range of phytochemicals with biological properties such as antioxidant and anticancer activityhowever knowledge about how biological activities are affected by processing is lackinga green cultivar and a red cultivar of curly kale were evaluated for watermethanolsoluble phytochemicals before and after processing involving blanching freeze storage and boilinbag heat treatmentin both kale cultivars processing resulted in a significant decrease of total phenolics antioxidant capacity and content and distribution of flavonols anthocyanins hydroxycinnamic acids glucosinolates and vitamin c interestingly the red curly kale cultivar had a higher capacity to withstand thermal loss of phytochemicalsthe extracts of both green and red curly kale inhibited the cell proliferation of three human colon cancer cell lines caco2 ht29 and hct 116however extracts from fresh plant material had a significantly stronger antiproliferative effect than extracts from processed plant material
