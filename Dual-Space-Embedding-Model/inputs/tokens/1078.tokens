background berries are a particularly rich source of polyphenolsthey also contain other bioactive substances such as vitamin c previous studies indicated that the consumption of polyphenolrich foods eg cocoa tea and red wine may induce beneficial changes in pathways related to cardiovascular healthwhether the consumption of berries has similar effects is unknownobjective we aimed to investigate the effects of berry consumption on hemostatic function serum lipids and blood pressure bpdesign middleaged unmedicated subjects n  72 with cardiovascular risk factors consumed moderate amounts of berry or control products for 8 wk in a singleblind randomized placebocontrolled intervention trialresults berry consumption inhibited platelet function as measured with a platelet function analyzer using collagen and adp as platelet activator changes 11 and 14 in the berry and control groups respectively p  0018 analysis of covariance ancovaplasma biomarkers of platelet activation coagulation and fibrinolysis did not change during the interventionserum hdlcholesterol concentrations increased significantly more p  0006 ancova in the berry than in the control group 52 and 06 respectively but total cholesterol and triacylglycerol remained unchangedsystolic bp decreased significantly p  0050 ancova the decrease mostly occurred in subjects with high baseline bp 73 mm hg in highest tertile p  0024 ancovapolyphenol and vitamin c concentrations in plasma increased whereas other nutritional biomarkers ie folate tocopherols sodium and potassium were unaffectedconclusion the consumption of moderate amounts of berries resulted in favorable changes in platelet function hdl cholesterol and bpthe results indicate that regular consumption of berries may play a role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease
