background reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations and how these are changing is a crucial input into health policy debatesin the global burden of diseases injuries and risk factors study 2010 gbd 2010 we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes with uncertainty intervals uis separately by age and sexmethods we attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration verbal autopsy mortality surveillance censuses surveys hospitals police records and mortuarieswe assessed data quality for completeness diagnostic accuracy missing data stochastic variations and probable causes of deathwe applied six different modelling strategies to estimate causespecific mortality trends depending on the strength of the datafor 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the cause of death ensemble model codem approach which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariatesmodel ensembles were developed from these component modelswe assessed model performance with rigorous outofsample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95 uisfor 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariatesfor 27 causes for which death is rare we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the gbd 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately estimated from all available data in the databasefor selected causes african trypanosomiasis congenital syphilis whooping cough measles typhoid and parathyroid leishmaniasis acute hepatitis e and hivaids we used natural history models based on information on incidence prevalence and casefatalitywe separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea lower respiratory infections and meningitis as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease maternal disorders cirrhosis and liver cancerfor deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters we used mortality shock regressionsfor every cause we estimated 95 uis that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where codem was usedwe constrained causespecific fractions within every agesex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributionsfindings in 2010 there were 528 million deaths globallyat the most aggregate level communicable maternal neonatal and nutritional causes were 249 of deaths worldwide in 2010 down from 159 million 341 of 465 million in 1990this decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease from 25 to 14 million lower respiratory infections from 34 to 28 million neonatal disorders from 31 to 22 million measles from 063 to 013 million and tetanus from 027 to 006 milliondeaths from hivaids increased from 030 million in 1990 to 15 million in 2010 reaching a peak of 17 million in 2006malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 199 since 1990 to 117 million deaths in 2010tuberculosis killed 12 million people in 2010deaths from noncommunicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010 accounting for two of every three deaths 345 million worldwide by 20108 million people died from cancer in 2010 38 more than two decades ago of these 15 million 19 were from trachea bronchus and lung cancerischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 129 million people in 2010 or one in four deaths worldwide compared with one in five in 1990 13 million deaths were due to diabetes twice as many as in 1990the fraction of global deaths due to injuries 51 million deaths was marginally higher in 2010 96 compared with two decades earlier 88this was driven by a 46 rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents 13 million in 2010 and a rise in deaths from fallsischaemic heart disease stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd lower respiratory infections lung cancer and hivaids were the leading causes of death in 2010ischaemic heart disease lower respiratory infections stroke diarrhoeal disease malaria and hivaids were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality ylls in 2010 similar to what was estimated for 1990 except for hivaids and preterm birth complicationsylls from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 4554 since 1990 ischaemic heart disease and stroke ylls increased by 1728regional variations in leading causes of death were substantialcommunicable maternal neonatal and nutritional causes still accounted for 76 of premature mortality in subsaharan africa in 2010age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose hivaids alzheimers disease diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in particular but for most diseases death rates fell in the past two decades including major vascular diseases copd most forms of cancer liver cirrhosis and maternal disordersfor other conditions notably malaria prostate cancer and injuries little change was notedinterpretation population growth increased average age of the worlds population and largely decreasing agespecific sexspecific and causespecific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable maternal neonatal and nutritional causes towards noncommunicable diseasesnevertheless communicable maternal neonatal and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of ylls in subsaharan africaoverlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition marked regional variation exists in many causes such as interpersonal violence suicide liver cancer diabetes cirrhosis chagas disease african trypanosomiasis melanoma and othersregional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basisfunding bill  melinda gates
