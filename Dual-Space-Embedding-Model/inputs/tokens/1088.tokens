organoarsenical drugs are widely used in the production of broiler chickens in the united statesfeathers from these chickens are processed into a meal product that is used as an animal feed additive and as an organic fertilizerresearch conducted to date suggests that arsenical drugs specifically roxarsone used in poultry production result in the accumulation of arsenic in the keratinous material of poultry feathersthe use of feather meal product in the human food system and in other settings may result in human exposures to arsenicconsequently the presence and nature of arsenic in twelve samples of feather meal product from six us states and china were examinedsince arsenic toxicity is highly speciesdependent speciation analysis using hplcicpms was performed to determine the biological relevance of detected arsenicarsenic was detected in all samples 444100 μg kg1 and speciation analyses revealed that inorganic forms of arsenic dominated representing 37  83 of total arsenicroxarsone was not detected in the samples 20 μg as kg1feather meal products represent a previously unrecognized source of arsenic in the food system and may pose additional risks to humans as a result of its use as an organic fertilizer and when animal waste is managedcopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
