objectives to determine the cytotoxicity of three commercial mouthrinses klorhex andorex and tanflex on buccal epithelial cells using micronucleus mn testmaterials and methods 28 patients with aged 1624 undergone three mouthrinses application were analyzed before and after one week exposurephysiologic saline was used for the control groupthe mn incidence was scored in the buccal epithelial of each participantsthe difference in pre and posttreatment after one week incidence of mn and plaque pi and gingival indices gi was compared by nonparametric statistical testsresults the micronuclei incidence increased in klorhex tanflex and andorex groups after exposure to mouth rinses p05but when compared with the control group there was not any difference between andorex and control group p05in the other study groups mn incidence was significantly increased after 7 days treatment p05gi scores of all groups were decreased significantly p05pi scores were decreased only in the klorhex group p05conclusions our primary findings support the presence of possible cytotoxic effects of the mouthrinses on gingival epithelial cells
