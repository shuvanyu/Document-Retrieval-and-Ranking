during the last few years there has been increasing interest in buccal epithelial cells for cytogenetic evaluation of different materialsin the present study the use of these cells and peripheral lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluation of chlorhexidine digluconate chx with comet assay single cell gel electrophoresis or scge is reportedthis technique detects dna strand breaks in individual cells in alkaline conditionsthirteen volunteers were requested to rinse their mouths with 012 chx solution for 18 daysbuccal epithelial cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from all participants at baseline and the end of the experimental periodone hundred cells per subject were analysed for the dna damagea statistical increase was observed in the damaged buccal and blood cells after the chx applicationthe mean grade of damage in buccal cells was statistically different from that in blood cellsdue to minimal absorption of chlorhexidine into the tissues and low concentrations of free chlorhexidine in the oral cavity the dna damage produced by chlorhexidine in lymphocytes was lower than in buccal epithelial cellsas chlorhexidine does not accumulate in the body the frequencies of dna damage could be transientdetected dna damage after chx use might be the indication of an earlier effect before dna repair begins and could be reversible
