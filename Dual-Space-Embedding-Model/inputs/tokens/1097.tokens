the role of nutrition in onset progression and treatment of periodontitis has not been thoroughly evaluatedin the present prospective clinical study we investigated the influence of a nutritional intervention on changes in clinical microbiological and immunological periodontal variables during a period of 12 months in patients with the metabolic syndrome and chronic periodontitistwenty female subjects with the metabolic syndrome and mild to moderate chronic periodontitis participated in a guided nutritional intervention programmeexaminations were assessed before and at 2 weeks 3 6 and 12 months after interventionclinical measurements included probing depth l√∂e and silness gingival index and quigleyhein plaque indexin gingival crevicular fluid periodontopathogens levels of il1beta and il6 as well as the activity of granulocyte elastase were determinedin stimulated saliva antioxidative and oxidative variables were measuredafter 12 months the following significant changes could be observed reduction of clinical probing depth 240 v 220 mm p  0001 reduction of gingival inflammation gingival index 113 v 09 p  0001 reduced concentrations of il1beta 463 v 110 pgml per site p  0001 as well as il6 185 v 034 pgml per site p  0022 in gingival crevicular fluidbacterial counts in gingival crevicular fluid as well as oxidative and antioxidative variables in saliva showed no significant changesonly salivary catalase showed a tendency to lower valuesthese findings indicate that in patients with the metabolic syndrome wholesome nutrition might reduce inflammatory variables of periodontal disease and promote periodontal health
