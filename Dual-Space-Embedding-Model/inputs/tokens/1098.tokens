bile acid binding capacity has been related to the cholesterollowering potential of foods and food fractionslowered recirculation of bile acids results in utilization of cholesterol to synthesize bile acid and reduced fat absorptionsecondary bile acids have been associated with increased risk of cancerbile acid binding potential has been related to lowering the risk of heart disease and that of cancerpreviously we have reported bile acid binding by several uncooked vegetableshowever most vegetables are consumed after cookinghow cooking would influence in vitro bile acid binding of various vegetables was investigated using a mixture of bile acids secreted in human bile under physiological conditionseight replicate incubations were conducted for each treatment simulating gastric and intestinal digestion which included a substrate only a bile acid mixture only and 6 with substrate and bile acid mixturecholestyramine a cholesterollowering bile acid binding drug was the positive control treatment and cellulose was the negative controlrelative to cholestyramine in vitro bile acid binding on dry matter basis was for the collard greens kale and mustard greens 13 broccoli 10 brussels sprouts and spinach 8 green bell pepper 7 and cabbage 5these results point to the significantly different p  or  05 healthpromoting potential of collard greens  kale  mustard greens  broccoli  brussels sprouts  spinach  green bell pepper  cabbage as indicated by their bile acid binding on dry matter basissteam cooking significantly improved the in vitro bile acid binding of collard greens kale mustard greens broccoli green bell pepper and cabbage compared with previously observed bile acid binding values for these vegetables raw uncookedinclusion of steamcooked collard greens kale mustard greens broccoli green bell pepper and cabbage in our daily diet as healthpromoting vegetables should be emphasizedthese greenleafy vegetables when consumed regularly after steam cooking would lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer advance human nutrition research and improve public health
