the effects of the major human serum bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid gcdc as well as unconjugated chenodeoxycholic acid cdc on the mcf7 human breast cancer cell line have been studied in vitro under oestrogen and bile acid deprived culture conditionsgcdc increased the growth of the breast cancer cells over the range 10300 micromat concentrations in excess of the bile acid binding capacity of the medium cell growth was preventedin contrast 10 microm cdc tended to reduce cell growthoestrogen er and progesterone pgr receptors ps2 and total cathepsin d were quantified by monoclonal antibody based immunoassaysten to 100 microm gcdc and 10 microm cdc downregulated er protein and this was accompanied by induction of the oestrogenregulated proteins pgr ps2 and possibly cathepsin d including increased secretion of the latter two proteins into the culture mediumall these changes were quantitatively similar to those observed with 10 nm oestradiolthe bile acid effects on er and pgr were not due to interference with the assay procedurescells incubated with 50 microm gcdc or 10 microm cdc had higher pmolar concentrations of the bile acids than controlsthis study suggests that naturally occurring bile acids influence the growth and steroid receptor function of human breast cancer cells
