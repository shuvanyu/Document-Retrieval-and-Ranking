dna damage is an essential component of the genesis of colonic cancergut microbial products and food components are thought to be principally responsible for the damage that initiates disease progressionmodified ames tests and comet assays have been developed for measuring mutagenicity and genotoxicitytheir relevance to oncogenesis remains to be confirmed as does the relative importance of different mutagenic and genotoxic compounds present in fecal water and the bacteria involved in their metabolismdietary intervention studies provide clues to the likely risks of oncogenesishighprotein diets lead to increases in nnitroso compounds in fecal water and greater dna damage as measured by the comet assay for exampleother dietary interventions such as nondigestible carbohydrates and probiotics may lead to lower fecal genotoxicityin order to make recommendations to the general public we must develop a better understanding of how genotoxic compounds are formed in the colon how accurate the ames and comet assays are and how diet affects genotoxicity
