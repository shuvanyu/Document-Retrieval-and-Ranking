bile acids were first proposed to be carcinogens in 1939 and 1940on the basis of later work with rodent models bile acids came to be regarded as cancer promoters rather than carcinogenshowever considerable indirect evidence obtained more recently supports the view that bile acids are carcinogens in humansat least 15 reports from 1980 through 2003 indicate that bile acids cause dna damagethe mechanism is probably indirect involving induction of oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species that then damage dnarepeated dna damage likely increases the mutation rate including the mutation rate of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenesadditional reports from 1994 through 2002 indicate that bile acids at the increased concentrations accompanying a high fat diet induce frequent apoptosisthose cells within the exposed population with reduced apoptosis capability tend to survive and selectively proliferatethat bile acids cause dna damage and may select for apoptosisresistant cells both leading to increased mutation indicates that bile acids are likely carcinogensin humans an increased incidence of cancer of the laryngopharyngeal tract esophagus stomach pancreas the small intestine near the ampulla of vater and the colon are associated with high levels of bile acidsthe much larger number of cell generations in the colonic and likely other gastrointestinal epithelia of humans compared to rodents may allow time for induction and selection of mutations leading to cancer in humans although not in rodents
