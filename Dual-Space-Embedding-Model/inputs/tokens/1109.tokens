almost all types of newborn respiratory failure are reversiblehowever supportive treatment oxygen and positive airway pressure can damage the lung and newborn respiratory failure remains a major cause of morbidity and death in infantsprolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo provides life support while allowing the lung to restwe have used ecmo in 45 moribund newborn infants 25 survivedneonatologists referred patients who were unresponsive to maximal therapythe right atrium and aortic arch were cannulated via the jugular vein and carotid arteryheparin was infused continuously to main activated clotting time at 200 to 300 secondsairway oxygenation and pressure were reduced to low levelsprimary diagnoses were hyaline membrane disease 14 6 survived 8 died meconium aspiration 22 15 survived 7 died persistent fetal circulation including diaphragmatic hernia 5 3 survived 2 died and sepsis 4 1 survived 3 diedgrowth development and brain and lung function are normal in 20 of 25 survivorsecmo decreased newborn respiratory failure mortality and morbidity rates in this phase i triala controlled randomized study is underwaythe results suggest that ecmo may be effective in older patients if used before irreversible lung damage occurs
