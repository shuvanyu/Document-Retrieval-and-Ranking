dental amalgam is 50 metallic mercury hg by weight and hg vapour continuously evolves from inplace dental amalgam causing increased hg content with increasing amalgam load in urine faeces exhaled breath saliva blood and various organs and tissues including the kidney pituitary gland liver and brainthe hg content also increases with maternal amalgam load in amniotic fluid placenta cord blood meconium various foetal tissues including liver kidney and brain in colostrum and breast milkbased on 2001 to 2004 population statistics 1811 million americans carry a grand total of 146 billion restored teethchildren as young as 26 months were recorded as having restored teethpast dental practice and recently available data indicate that the majority of these restorations are composed of dental amalgamemploying recent us populationbased statistics on body weight and the frequency of dentally restored tooth surfaces and recent research on the incremental increase in urinary hg concentration per amalgamfilled tooth surface estimates of hg exposure from amalgam fillings were determined for 5 age groups of the us populationthree specific exposure scenarios were considered each scenario incrementally reducing the number of tooth surfaces assumed to be restored with amalgambased on the least conservative of the scenarios evaluated it was estimated that some 672 million americans would exceed the hg dose associated with the reference exposure level rel of 03 μgm3 established by the us environmental protection agency and 1223 million americans would exceed the dose associated with the rel of 003 μgm3 established by the california environmental protection agencyexposure estimates are consistent with previous estimates presented by health canada in 1995 and amount to 02 to 04 μgday per amalgamfilled tooth surface or 05 to 1 μgdayamalgamfilled tooth depending on age and other factorscopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
