in a recent study prostatectomy specimens from which propionibacterium acnes was cultured were more likely to have inflammation than culturenegative specimens or specimens positive for other bacteria leading the authors to hypothesize that p acnesmediated inflammation may contribute to prostate carcinogenesisto indirectly explore associations between p acnes and prostate cancer we investigated severe acne as measured by tetracycline use for four or more years in relation to incident prostate cancer in the health professionals followup studyon the 1992 followup questionnaire participants were asked whether they had ever used tetracycline for at least two months at a time eg for acne or other reason and their duration of useprostate cancer diagnoses were ascertained on each subsequent biennial questionnaire and confirmed by medical record reviewbetween 1992 and 2002 2147 cases of prostate cancer were reported among 34629 eligible participantsmen who used tetracycline for four or more years had a significantly higher risk of prostate cancer 16 cases 1569 personyears than men who did not use tetracycline 2071 cases 304822 personyears multivariableadjusted rr170 95 ci103280although intriguing this finding should be viewed cautiously because of the small number of exposed cases indirect assessment of severe acne and complex etiology of acne which is not limited to p acnes infectiontherefore additional biologic and epidemiologic studies are necessary to determine and elucidate the possible role of p acnes infection in prostate carcinogenesis
