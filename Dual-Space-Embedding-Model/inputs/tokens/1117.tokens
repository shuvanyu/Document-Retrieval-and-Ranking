the purpose of this paper is to highlight the endocrine signaling of western diet a fundamental environmental factor involved in the pathogenesis of epidemic acnewestern nutrition is characterized by high calorie uptake high glycemic load high fat and meat intake as well as increased consumption of insulin and igf1level elevating dairy proteinsmetabolic signals of western diet are sensed by the nutrientsensitive kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1 which integrates signals of cellular energy growth factors insulin igf1 and proteinderived signals predominantly leucine provided in high amounts by milk proteins and meatmtorc1 activates srebp the master transcription factor of lipogenesisleucine stimulates mtorc1srebp signaling and leucine is directly converted by sebocytes into fatty acids and sterols for sebaceous lipid synthesisoveractivated mtorc1 increases androgen hormone secretion and most likely amplifies androgendriven mtorc1 signaling of sebaceous folliclestestosterone directly activates mtorc1future research should investigate the effects of isotretinoin on sebocyte mtorc1 activityit is conceivable that isotretinoin may downregulate mtorc1 in sebocytes by upregulation of nuclear levels of foxo1the role of western diet in acne can only be fully appreciated when all stimulatory inputs for maximal mtorc1 activation ie glucose insulin igf1 and leucine are adequately consideredepidemic acne has to be recognized as an mtorc1driven disease of civilization like obesity type 2 diabetes cancer and neurodegenerative diseasesthese new insights into western dietmediated mtorc1hyperactivity provide a rational basis for dietary intervention in acne by attenuating mtorc1 signaling by reducing 1 total energy intake 2 hyperglycemic carbohydrates 3 insulinotropic dairy proteins and 4 leucinerich meat and dairy proteinsthe necessary dietary changes are opposed to the evolution of industrialized food and fast food distribution of westernized countriesan attenuation of mtorc1 signaling is only possible by increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruit the major components of vegan or paleolithic dietsthe dermatologist bears a tremendous responsibility for his young acne patients who should be advised to modify their dietary habits in order to reduce activating stimuli of mtorc1 not only to improve acne but to prevent the harmful and expensive march to other mtorc1related chronic diseases later in life
