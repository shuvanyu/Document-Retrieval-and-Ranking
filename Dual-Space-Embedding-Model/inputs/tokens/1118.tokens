objective to clarify the hormonal context of breast cancer etiology we used data from a large populationbased casecontrol study to investigate the relationship between breast cancer risk and a history of diabetes mellitus disorders associated with estrogen stimulation uterine fibroids endometriosis gallstones and disorders associated with androgen stimulation acne hirsutism and polycystic ovariesmethods breast cancer patients between 50 and 75 years old were identified from statewide tumor registries in wisconsin massachusetts and new hampshire controls were randomly selected from drivers license lists age less than 65 or medicare enrollment files age 6574information on reproductive history medical history and personal habits was obtained by telephone interviewa total of 5659 cases and 5928 controls were interviewed and provided suitable dataresults there was no overall association between breast cancer risk and reported history of diabetes mellitus endometriosis uterine fibroids gallstones or cholecystectomyhowever the disorders with androgenic associations all conferred an increased risk the overall odds ratio or for a history of acne was 14 95 ci 1019 that for hirsutism was 12 95 ci 08118 and that for polycystic ovaries 16 95 ci 0832diabetes mellitus diagnosed before age 35 conferred an odds ratio of 052 95 02511 while diabetes diagnosed at a later age was associated with an increased risk or  12 95 ci 1014conclusions androgenrelated phenomena are likely to be important in the etiology of breast cancer
