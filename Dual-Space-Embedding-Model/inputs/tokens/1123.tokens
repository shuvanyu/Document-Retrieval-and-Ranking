background recipients of organ transplants are susceptible to kaposis sarcoma as a result of treatment with immunosuppressive drugssirolimus rapamycin an immunosuppressive drug may also have antitumor effectsmethods we stopped cyclosporine therapy in 15 kidneytransplant recipients who had biopsyproven kaposis sarcoma and began sirolimus therapyall patients underwent an excisional biopsy of the lesion and one biopsy of normal skin at the time of diagnosisa second biopsy was performed at the site of a previous kaposis sarcoma lesion six months after sirolimus therapy was begunwe examined biopsy specimens for vascular endothelial growth factor vegf flk1kdr protein and phosphorylated akt and p70s6 kinase two enzymes in the signaling pathway targeted by sirolimusresults three months after sirolimus therapy was begun all cutaneous kaposis sarcoma lesions had disappeared in all patientsremission was confirmed histologically in all patients six months after sirolimus therapy was begunthere were no acute episodes of rejection or changes in kidneygraft functionlevels of flk1kdr and phosphorylated akt and p70s6 kinase were increased in kaposis sarcoma cellsthe expression of vegf was increased in kaposis sarcoma cells and even more so in normal skin cells around the kaposis sarcoma lesionsconclusions sirolimus inhibits the progression of dermal kaposis sarcoma in kidneytransplant recipients while providing effective immunosuppressioncopyright 2005 massachusetts medical society
