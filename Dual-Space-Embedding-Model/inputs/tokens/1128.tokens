fisetin a flavonol present in vegetables and fruits possesses antioxidative and antiinflammatory propertiesin this study we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents dietinduced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1 a central mediator of cellular growth cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesisto evaluate whether fisetin regulates mtorc1 signaling we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70kda ribosomal protein s6 kinase 1 s6k1 and mtorc1 in 3t3l1 preadipocytesfisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of s6k1 and mtorc1 in a time and concentrationdependent mannerto further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mtorc1 signaling we analyzed the phosphorylation of s6k1 mtor and akt in fisetintreated tsc2knockdown cellsthe results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mtorc1 activity in an aktdependent mannerrecent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mtorc1 activityfisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mtorthe inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mtor activity suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mtorc1 signalingfisetin supplementation in mice fed a highfat diet hfd significantly attenuated hfdinduced increases in body weight and white adipose tissuewe also observed that fisetin efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of akt s6k1 and mtorc1 in adipose tissuecollectively these results suggest that inhibition of mtorc1 signaling by fisetin prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3t3l1 preadipocytes and obesity in hfdfed micetherefore fisetin may be a useful phytochemical agent for attenuating dietinduced obesitycopyright  2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
