the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor plays a key role in the regulation of cellular metabolism growth and proliferationit forms two multiprotein complexes known as complex 1 mtorc1 and 2 mtorc2raptor and rictor are the core proteins for mtorc1 and mtorc2 respectivelythis study examines the relationship between mtorc1 rictor and raptor mrna expression and human breast cancerfurthermore the correlation between mtorc1 and htert was investigatedbreast cancer tissues n150 and normal tissues n31 were analysed using reverse transcription and quantitative pcrtranscript levels were correlated with clinicopathological datahigher mtor expression was noted in breast cancer tissue p00018 higher grade tumours grade 2 vs 3 p0047 in ductal tumours p00014 and was associated with worse overall survival p001rictor expression was significantly higher in background breast tissues compared with tumours and was inversely related to the nottingham prognostic index npi1 vs 2 p003 and tumour grade grade 1 vs 3 p001 and was associated with better overall p0037 and diseasefree survival p0048the mrna expression of raptor was higher in tumours compared with normal tissuesfurthermore the expression of raptor was associated with a higher tumour grade grade 1 vs 3 p0027a highly significant positive correlation between mtor and htert p000001 was observedthese observations are consistent with the role of mtorc1 in the antiapoptosis pathway and suggest that selective inhibitors of mtorc1 may be more efficacious in human breast cancerour findings support the hypothesis that mtorc1 is an important upregulator of telomerase in breast cancer
