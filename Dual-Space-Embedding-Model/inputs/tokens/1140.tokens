pulses are low in energy density supporting their inclusion in the diet for the management of risk factors of the metabolic syndrome metsynthe aim of the present study was to describe the effects of frequent consumption five cupsweek over 8 weeks of pulses yellow peas chickpeas navy beans and lentils compared with counselling to reduce energy intake by 2093 kjd 500 kcald on risk factors of the metsyn in two groups nineteen and twentyone subjects respectively of overweight or obese mean bmi 328 kgm2 adultsbody weight waist circumference blood pressure fasting blood parameters and 24 h food intakes were measured at weeks 1 4 and 8blood glucose insulin cpeptide glucagonlike peptide1 glp1 and ghrelin were measured after a 75 g oral glucose load at weeks 1 and 8at week 8 both groups reported reductions in energy intake waist circumference systolic blood pressure glycosylated hb hba1c and glucose auc and homeostasis model of insulin resistance homair following the glucose load p  005however hdl fasting cpeptide and insulin auc responses were dependent on diet p  005hdl and cpeptide increased by 45 and 123  respectively in the pulse group but decreased by 08 and 76  respectively in the energyrestricted groupinsulin auc decreased in both females and males on the energyrestricted diet by 242 and 48  respectively but on the pulse diet it decreased by 139  in females and increased by 273  in males p  005in conclusion frequent consumption of pulses in an ad libitum diet reduced risk factors of the metsyn and these effects were equivalent and in some instances stronger than counselling for dietary energy reduction
