walnuts contain bioactive molecules that may contribute to their beneficial effects including alphalinolenic acid ala and phytosterolsin these studies extracts of walnut purified compounds or postprandial serum were examined for effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and gene expressionextracts derived from walnut oil decreased proliferation of mcf7 cells as did ala and βsitosterolthe gene expression response of ala in the mouse breast cancer cell line tm2h indicates this molecule has multiple cellular targets with peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor ppar target genes liver x receptor lxr and farnesoid x receptor fxr target genes being affectedin transactivation assays walnut oil extracts increased activity of fxr to a greater extent than the other tested nuclear receptorswhen examined separately walnut components ala and βsitosterol were the most efficacious activators of fxrwhen serum from individuals fed walnut components were applied to mcf7 cells there was a correlation between body mass index and breast cancer cell proliferation in vitrotaken together these data support an effect of walnut and its bioactive constituents on mammary epithelial cells and that multiple molecular targets may be involved
