background increasing nut intake has been associated with reduced risk of diabetes mellitus which is a risk factor for pancreatic cancermethods we prospectively followed 75 680 women in the nurses health study and examined the association between nut consumption and pancreatic cancer riskparticipants with a previous history of cancer were excludednut consumption was assessed at baseline and updated every 2 to 4 yearsrelative risks rrs and 95 confidence intervals 95 cis were estimated using cox proportional hazards modelsresults we documented 466 incident cases of pancreatic cancerafter adjusting for age height smoking physical activity and total energy intake women who consumed a 28g 1 oz serving size of nuts 2 times per week experienced a significantly lower risk of pancreatic cancer rr 065 95 ci 047092 p for trend0007 when compared with those who largely abstained from nutsthe results did not appreciably change after further adjustment for body mass index bmi and history of diabetes mellitus rr 068 95 ci 048095 p for trend001the inverse association persisted within strata defined by bmi physical activity smoking and intakes of red meat fruits and vegetablesconclusion frequent nut consumption is inversely associated with risk of pancreatic cancer in this large prospective cohort of women independent of other potential risk factors for pancreatic cancer
