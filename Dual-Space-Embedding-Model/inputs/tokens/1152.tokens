background  aims coffee consumption has been suggested to reduce the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma hccwe performed a metaanalysis of epidemiological studies to provide updated information on how coffee drinking affects hcc riskmethods we performed a pubmedmedline search of the original articles published in english from 1966 through september 2012 on casecontrol or cohort studies that associated coffee consumption with liver cancer or hccwe calculated the summary relative risk rr for any low and high consumption of coffee vs no consumptionthe cutoff point for low vs high consumption was set to 3 cups per day in 9 studies and 1 cup per day in 5 studiesresults the summary rr for any coffee consumption vs no consumption was 060 from 16 studies comprising a total of 3153 hcc cases 95 confidence interval ci 050071 the rrs were 056 from 8 casecontrol studies 95 ci 042075 and 064 from 8 cohort studies 95 ci 052078compared with no coffee consumption the summary rr was 072 95 ci 061084 for low consumption and 044 95 ci 039050 for high consumptionthe summary rr was 080 95 ci 077084 for an increment of 1 cup of coffee per daythe inverse relationship between coffee and hcc risk was consistent regardless of the subjects sex alcohol drinking or history of hepatitis or liver diseaseconclusions from this metaanalysis the risk of hcc is reduced by 40 for any coffee consumption vs no consumptionthe inverse association might partly or largely exist because patients with liver and digestive diseases reduce their coffee intakehowever coffee has been shown to affect liver enzymes and development of cirrhosis and therefore could protect against liver carcinogenesiscopyright  2013 aga institutepublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
