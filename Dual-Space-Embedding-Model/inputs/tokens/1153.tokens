background the influence of excess body weight on the risk of death from cancer has not been fully characterizedmethods in a prospectively studied population of more than 900000 us adults 404576 men and 495477 women who were free of cancer at enrollment in 1982 there were 57145 deaths from cancer during 16 years of followupwe examined the relation in men and women between the bodymass index in 1982 and the risk of death from all cancers and from cancers at individual sites while controlling for other risk factors in multivariate proportionalhazards modelswe calculated the proportion of all deaths from cancer that was attributable to overweight and obesity in the us population on the basis of risk estimates from the current study and national estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the us adult populationresults the heaviest members of this cohort those with a bodymass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters of at least 40 had death rates from all cancers combined that were 52 percent higher for men and 62 percent higher for women than the rates in men and women of normal weightfor men the relative risk of death was 152 95 percent confidence interval 113 to 205 for women the relative risk was 162 95 percent confidence interval 140 to 187in both men and women bodymass index was also significantly associated with higher rates of death due to cancer of the esophagus colon and rectum liver gallbladder pancreas and kidney the same was true for death due to nonhodgkins lymphoma and multiple myelomasignificant trends of increasing risk with higher bodymassindex values were observed for death from cancers of the stomach and prostate in men and for death from cancers of the breast uterus cervix and ovary in womenon the basis of associations observed in this study we estimate that current patterns of overweight and obesity in the united states could account for 14 percent of all deaths from cancer in men and 20 percent of those in womenconclusions increased body weight was associated with increased death rates for all cancers combined and for cancers at multiple specific sitescopyright 2003 massachusetts medical society
