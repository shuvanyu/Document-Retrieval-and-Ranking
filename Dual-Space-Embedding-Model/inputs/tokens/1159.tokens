harmane one of the heterocyclic amines hcas is a potent neurotoxin linked to human diseasesdietary exposure especially in cooked meats is the major source of exogenous exposure for humanshowever knowledge of harmane concentrations in cooked meat samples is limitedour goals were to 1 quantify the concentration of harmane in different types of cooked meat samples 2 compare its concentration to that of other more wellunderstood hcas and 3 examine the relationship between harmane concentration and level of donenessthirty barbecuedgrilled meat samples 8 beef steak 12 hamburger 10 chicken were analyzed for harmane and four other hcas 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo 45bpyridine phip amino38dimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline meiqx 2amino348trimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline dimeiqx and 2amino16dimethylfuro32eimidazo45bpyridine ifpmean  sd harmane concentration was 563  663 ngg harmane concentration was highest in chicken 848  986 ngg and lowest in beef steak 380  36 nggharmane concentration was higher than that of the other hcas and significantly correlated with phip concentrationharmane concentration was associated with meat doneness in samples of cooked beef steak and hamburger although the correlation between meat doneness and concentration was greater for phip than for harmaneevidence indicates that harmane was detectable in nanograms per gram quantities in cooked meat especially chicken and moreover was more abundant than other hcasthere was some correlation between meat doneness and harmane concentration although this correlation was less robust than that observed for phipdata such as these may be used to improve estimation of human dietary exposure to this neurotoxin
