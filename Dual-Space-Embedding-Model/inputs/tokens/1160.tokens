norharman and harman are two heterocyclic betacarboline 9hpyrido34bindole alkaloids with biological and potential toxicological activity that appear in foodstuffs and environmental sourcesto assess the occurrence and distribution of these compounds and to estimate the exposure levels based on the detected amounts numerous samples of foodstuffs and cigarette smoke were analysed by solidphase extraction and highperformance liquid chromatographyfluorescencethe levels found of betacarbolines were highly variablelow processed foodstuffs iemilk yoghurt uncooked meats and fish did not contain norharman and harman above the detection limitothers however contained relatively high concentrations at the tens of ng g1 or microg l1 level depending on the processing conditions as for example welldone cooked meat and fishthe highest amounts of norharman and harman were found in brewed coffee 29207 microg l1 sauces soy sauce and tabasco among others 4252 microg l1 well done cooked meat and fish 57160 ng g1 toasted bread 42160 ng g1 and fermented alcoholic beverages nd41 mug l1betacarbolines also occurred in a high amount in the mainstream of cigarette smoke 2072780 ngcigarette which is an important contributor to daily exposure to these compoundsbased on these results it is concluded that the daily exposure to betacarbolines in humans might be from tens to hundreds of micrograms with cigarette smoke coffee certain seasonings cooked foods and alcoholic beverages in this order being the major contributorsmany other foodstuffs might also contribute with minor amounts of norharman and harmanfoods and tobacco smoke might be potential contributors to the reported endogenous presence of betacarbolines in humans
