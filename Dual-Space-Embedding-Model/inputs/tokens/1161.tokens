backgroundaim harmane 1methyl9hpyrido34bindole is a tremorproducing neurotoxinblood harmane concentrations are elevated in essential tremor et patients for unclear reasonspotential mechanisms include increased dietary harmane intake especially through wellcooked meat or geneticmetabolic factorswe tested the hypothesis that meat consumption and level of meat doneness are higher in et cases than in controlsmethods detailed data were collected using the lawrence livermore national laboratory meat questionnaireresults total current meat consumption was greater in men with than without et 1353  711 vs 1106  804 gday p  003 but not in women with versus without et 806  500 vs 793  510 gday p  076in an adjusted logistic regression analysis in males higher total current meat consumption was associated with et or  1006 p  004 ie with 10 additional gday of meat odds of et increased by 6male cases had higher odds of being in the highest than lowest quartile of total current meat consumption adjusted or  2136 p  0001meat doneness level was similar in cases and controlsconclusion this study provides evidence of a dietary difference between male et cases and male controlsthe etiological ramifications of these results warrant additional investigationcopyright  2008 s karger ag basel
