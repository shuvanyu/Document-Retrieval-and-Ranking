background blood concentrations of harmane a tremorproducing neurotoxin are elevated in essential tremor etharmane is also a comutagenobjective to compare the prevalence of cancer in et cases vs controls and determine whether blood harmane concentrations are elevated among et cases with cancermethods casecontrol designresults 66267 247 et cases vs 55331 166 controls had cancer adjusted or 152 95 ci 101  230 p  004among specific cancer types colon cancer was more prevalent in et cases than controls 26 vs 06 p  004log blood harmane concentration was higher in et cases vs controls p  002 and in participants with vs without cancer p  002log blood harmane concentration was highest in et cases with cancer when compared with other groups p  0009discussion these links between cancer and et and between high blood harmane and cancer in et deserve further study
