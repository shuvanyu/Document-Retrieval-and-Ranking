orange fleshed sweet potato ofsp has been identified as a good source of betacarotene but the betacarotene bioaccessibility is affected by processingin this study the effect of traditional heat processing methods on the microstructure and in vitro bioaccessibility of betacarotene from ofsp were investigatedbioaccessibility was determined using simulated in vitro digestion model followed by membrane filtration to separate the micellar fraction containing bioaccessible betacaroteneprocessing led to decrease in the amount of alltransbetacarotene and increase in 13cisbetacaroteneprocessed ofsp had significantly higher p  005 bioaccessible betacarotene compared to the raw formsbioaccessibility varied with processing treatments in the order raw  baked  steamedboiled  deep friedlight microscopy showed that the microstructure of ofsp was disrupted by the processing methods employedthe cell walls of ofsp were sloughed by the traditional heat processing methods appliedthe findings show that heat processing improves bioaccessibility of betacarotene in ofsp and this was probably due to disruption of the tissue microstructure
