intervention strategies regarding the biofortification of orangefleshed sweet potato which is a rich source of carotenoids for combating vitamin a deficiency are being developed in brazilthis study was conducted to evaluate the concentrations of individual carotenoids total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity in the roots of four biofortified sweet potato cultivars that were raw or processed by four common heat treatmentshplc folinciocalteu dpph and abts assays were usedall cultivars showed high levels of carotenoids in raw roots predominantly alltransβcarotene 7911285 mg100 g1 dw suggesting a high estimated vitamin a activitythe cnph 1194 cultivar reported carotenoids values highest than those of other cultivars p  005the total phenolic compounds varied among cultivars and heat treatments 096205 mgg1 dwin most cases the heat treatments resulted in a significant decrease in the carotenoids and phenolic compounds contents as well as antioxidant capacityprocessing of flour presented the greatest losses of major carotenoids and phenolicsthe phenolic compounds showed more stability than carotenoids after processingthere were significant correlations between the carotenoids and phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity
