aim to investigate the effects of proteins purified from sweet potato storage roots on human colorectal cancer cell linesmethods 345dimethylthiazol2yl25diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt assay hoechst 33258 nuclear staining and boyden transwell chamber methods were used to determine whether purified sweet potato protein spp from fresh sweet potato roots affected proliferation migration and invasion respectively of human colorectal cancer sw480 cells in vitrothe inhibitory effects of spp on growth of human colorectal cancer hct8 cells intraperitoneally xenografted in nude mice and spontaneous lung metastasis of murine lewis lung carcinoma 3ll cells subcutaneously transplanted in c57 bl6 mice were also investigated in vivoresults spp inhibited the proliferation of sw480 cells in a dosedependent manner with an ic50 value of 38732 μmoll r2  0980 p  0003 in the mtt assayhoechst 33258 nuclear staining further revealed inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis by sppthe transwell assay disclosed significant reduction in migrated cellsfield by 8 μmoll spp 84  26 vs 233  54 p  0031 and invaded cellsfield through the ecmatrix by 08 μmoll spp compared with the control 252  52 vs 348  61 p  0038both intraperitoneal ip and intragastric ig administration of spp led to significant suppression of growth of intraperitoneally inoculated hct8 cells in nude mice to 580  59 p  0037 and 435  71 p  0004 of the controls respectively after 9 d treatmentbloody ascites additionally disappeared after ip injection of trypsin inhibitornotably ig and ip administration of spp induced a significant decrease in spontaneous pulmonary metastatic nodule formation in c57 bl6 mice 210  123 and 273  127 noduleslung vs 425  45 noduleslung in controls respectively p  005 after 25 d treatmentmoreover the average weight of primary tumor nodules in the hind leg of mice decreased from 82  13 gmice in the control to 61  14 gmice in the ip group p  0035conclusion spp exerts significant antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects on human colorectal cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo
