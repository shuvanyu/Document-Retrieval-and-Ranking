background both hempseed oil ho and flaxseed oil fo contain high amounts of essential fatty acids fas ielinoleic acid la 182n6 and alphalinolenic acid ala 183n3 but almost in opposite ratiosan excessive intake of one essential fa over the other may interfere with the metabolism of the other while the metabolisms of la and ala compete for the same enzymesit is not known whether there is a difference between n3 and n6 fa of plant origin in the effects on serum lipid profileaim of the study to compare the effects of ho and fo on the profile of serum lipids and fasting concentrations of serum total and lipoprotein lipids plasma glucose and insulin and haemostatic factors in healthy humansmethods fourteen healthy volunteers participated in the studya randomised doubleblind crossover design was usedthe volunteers consumed ho and fo 30 mlday for 4 weeks eachthe periods were separated by a 4week washout periodresults the ho period resulted in higher proportions of both la and gammalinolenic acid in serum cholesteryl esters ce and triglycerides tg as compared with the fo period p  0001 whereas the fo period resulted in a higher proportion of ala in both serum ce and tg as compared with the ho period p  0001the proportion of arachidonic acid in ce was lower after the fo period than after the ho period p  005the ho period resulted in a lower totaltohdl cholesterol ratio compared with the fo period p  0065no significant differences were found between the periods in measured values of fasting serum total or lipoprotein lipids plasma glucose insulin or hemostatic factorsconclusions the effects of ho and fo on the profile of serum lipids differed significantly with only minor effects on concentrations of fasting serum total or lipoprotein lipids and no significant changes in concentrations of plasma glucose or insulin or in haemostatic factors
