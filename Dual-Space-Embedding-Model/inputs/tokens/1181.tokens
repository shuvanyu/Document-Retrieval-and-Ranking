the objective of this study was to evaluate the precursors of acrylamide formation in sweet potato sp ipomoea batatas l lam chips and to determine the effect of different types of vegetable oils vos that is palm olein coconut oil canola oil and soya bean oil on acrylamide formationthe reducing sugars and amino acids in the sp slices were analyzed and the acrylamide concentrations of sp chips were measuredsp chips that were fried in a lower degree of unsaturation oils contained a lower acrylamide concentration 1443 μgkg whereas those fried with higher degree of unsaturated oils contained a higher acrylamide concentration 2019 μgkgsp roots were found to contain acrylamide precursors that is 417 mgg glucose and 505 mgg fructose and 163 mgg free asparaginethe type of vo and condition used for frying significantly influenced acrylamide formationthis study clearly indicates that the contribution of lipids in the formation of acrylamide should not be neglected 2013 institute of food technologists
