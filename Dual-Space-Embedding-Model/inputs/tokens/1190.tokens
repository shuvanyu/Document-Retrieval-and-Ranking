background bikunin a kunitztype protease inhibitor specifically inhibits tumor invasion and metastasismethods the authors initially evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of oncedaily oral administration of different doses of bikunin against human ovarian carcinoma hra cells growing in the peritonea of nude micefor the in vivo studies female 7weekold nude mice were randomized to 1 of 4 groups bikunintreated groups n  9 in each group received 3 10 or 30 microgg body weight per day bikunin for 7 days via gastrointestinal gavage and a control group n  9 received the vehicle solution phosphatebuffered saline via gastrointestinal gavageon day 9 the abdominal cavity was examined by two observers who were blinded to treatmentresults after oral administration intact bikunin was detectable in mouse serum specimens at 3 and 6 hoursthis was followed by a decline at 12 hoursthe mice given bikunin at the highest dose level had a 40 decrease in tumor loadthe highest uptake in the tumor was obtained with 125ibikunin 12 hours postadministrationno effect on either food intake or body weight was observed in the treated versus sham groupsthe current study was the first to report the potent activity of oncedaily oral administration of bikunin against ovarian carcinomanext the authors performed a phase i trial to determine the maximumtolerated dose mtd and safety of a oncedaily oral administration schedulethe indication was locally advanced uterine cervical carcinoma after definitive treatmentan escalating dose 3 10 and 30 mgkg per day of bikunin was administered orally to nine patients for 7 daysthere were no doselimiting toxicities and the mtd of the bikunin schedule was not definedthe authors also obtained preliminary data on its effect on urokinasetype plasminogen activator expression at the highest dose levelconclusions oncedaily oral administration of bikunin was found to be safe in humans and exhibited signs of biologic activitycopyright 2004 american cancer society
