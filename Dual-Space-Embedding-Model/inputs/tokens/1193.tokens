background china is increasingly facing the challenge of control of the growing burden of noncommunicable diseaseswe assessed the epidemiology of alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia in china between 1990 and 2010 to improve estimates of the burden of disease analyse time trends and inform health policy decisions relevant to chinas rapidly ageing populationmethods in our systematic review we searched for reports of alzheimers disease or dementia in china published in chinese and english between 1990 and 2010we searched china national knowledge infrastructure wanfang and pubmed databasestwo investigators independently assessed case definitions of alzheimers disease and dementia we excluded studies that did not use internationally accepted case definitionswe also excluded reviews and viewpoints studies with no numerical estimates and studies not done in mainland chinawe used poisson regression and un demographic data to estimate the prevalence in nine age groups incidence and standardised mortality ratio of dementia and its subtypes in china in 1990 2000 and 2010findings our search returned 12642 reports of which 89 met the inclusion criteria 75 assessed prevalence 13 incidence and nine mortalityin total the included studies had 340247 participants in which 6357 cases of alzheimers disease were recorded254367 people were assessed for other forms of dementia of whom 3543 had vascular dementia frontotemporal dementia or lewy body dementiain 1990 the prevalence of all forms of dementia was 18 95 ci 00444 at 6569 years and 421 00889 at age 9599 yearsin 2010 prevalence was 26 00282 at age 6569 years and 605 397813 at age 9599 yearsthe number of people with dementia in china was 368 million 95 ci 222514 in 1990 562 million 442682 in 2000 and 919 million 5921248 in 2010in the same period the number of people with alzheimers disease was 193 million 115271 in 1990 371 million 284458 people in 2000 and 569 million 385753 in 2010the incidence of dementia was 987 cases per 1000 personyears that of alzheimers disease was 625 cases per 1000 personyears that of vascular dementia was 242 cases per 1000 personyears and that of other rare forms of dementia was 046 cases per 1000 personyearswe retrieved mortality data for 1032 people with dementia and 20157 healthy controls who were followed up for 37 yearsthe median standardised mortality ratio was 1941 iqr 174245interpretation our analysis suggests that previous estimates of dementia burden based on smaller datasets might have underestimated the burden of dementia in chinathe burden of dementia seems to be increasing faster than is generally assumed by the international health communityrapid and effective government responses are needed to tackle dementia in lowincome and middleincome countriesfunding nossal institute of global health university of melbourne australia the national 12th fiveyear major projects of china national health and medical research council australiachina exchange fellowship importation and development of highcalibre talents project of beijing municipal institutions and the bill  melinda gates foundationcopyright  2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
