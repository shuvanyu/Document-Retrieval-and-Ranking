context alzheimer disease ad represents a major and increasing public health problemif populations were identified with significantly lower or higher incidence rates of ad the search for risk factors in the genesis of ad could be greatly enhancedobjective to compare incidence rates of dementia and ad in 2 diverse elderly communitydwelling populationsdesign the indianapolisibadan dementia project a longitudinal prospective populationbased study consisting of a baseline survey 19921993 and 2 subsequent followup waves after 2 years 19941995 and 5 years 19971998each wave followed a 2stage design with an inhome screening interview followed by a full diagnostic workup of a subsample of participants based on screening performancesetting and participants a total of 2459 communitydwelling yoruba residents of ibadan nigeria without dementia and 2147 communitydwelling african american residents of indianapolis ind without dementia all aged 65 years or olderthe cohorts were followed up for a mean of 51 years and 47 years respectivelymain outcome measures incident cases of dementia and ad in each of the 2 populationsresults the agestandardized annual incidence rates were significantly lower among yoruba than among african americans for dementia yoruba 135 95 confidence interval ci 113156 african americans 324 95 ci 211438 and for ad yoruba 115 95 ci 096135 african americans 252 95 ci 140364conclusion this is the first report of incidence rate differences for dementia and ad in studies of 2 populations from nonindustrialized and industrialized countries using identical methods and the same group of investigators in both sitesfurther explorations of these population differences may identify potentially modifiable environmental or genetic factors to account for site differences in dementia and ad
