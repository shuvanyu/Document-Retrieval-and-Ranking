the purpose of the current study was to determine the antiobesity and antiinflammatory effects of an extract of purple sweet potatoes psps on 3t3l1 adipocytesfor this purpose differentiated 3t3l1 adipocytes were treated with a psp extract at concentrations of 1000 2000 and 3000 Î¼gml for 24 hoursthen we measured the changes in the sizes of the adipocytes the secretion of leptin and the mrnaprotein expression of lipogenic inflammatory and lipolytic factors after the treatment with the psp extractthe psp extract diminished leptin secretion indicating that growth of fat droplets was suppressedthe extract also suppressed the expression of mrnas of lipogenic and inflammatory factors and promoted lipolytic actionthe antioxidative activity of the psp extract was also measured using three different in vitro methods 11diphenyl2picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity ferric reducing ability potential assay and chelating activity of transition metal ionstaken together our study shows that psp extract has antilipogenic antiinflammatory and lipolytic effects on adipocytes and has radical scavenging and reducing activity
