prospective studies indicate that high intake of dietary flavanols such as those contained in cocoachocolate are associated with reduced rates of cardiovascularrelated morbidity and mortality in humansnumerous mechanisms may underlie these associations such as favorable effects of flavanols on blood pressure platelet aggregation thrombosis inflammation and the vascular endotheliumthe brachial artery flowmediated dilation fmd technique has emerged as a robust method to quantify endothelial function in humanscollectively the preponderance of evidence indicates that fmd is a powerful surrogate measure for firm cardiovascular endpoints such as cardiovascularrelated mortality in humansthus literally thousands of studies have utilized this technique to document group differences in fmd as well as to assess the effects of various interventions on fmdin regards to the latter numerous studies indicate that both acute and chronic ingestion of cocoachocolate increases fmd in humansincreases in fmd after cocoachocolate ingestion appear to be dosedependent such that greater increases in fmd are observed after ingestion of larger quantitiesthe mechanisms underlying these responses are likely diverse however most data suggest an effect of increased nitric oxide bioavailabilitythus positive vascular effects of cocoachocolate on the endothelium may underlie ie be linked mechanistically to reductions in cardiovascular risk in humanscopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
