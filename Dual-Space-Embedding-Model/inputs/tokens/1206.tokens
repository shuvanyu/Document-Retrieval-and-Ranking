background dark chocolate has potent antioxidant propertiescoronary atherosclerosis is promoted by impaired endothelial function and increased platelet activationtraditional risk factors high oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant defenses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis particularly in transplanted heartsthus flavonoidrich dark chocolate holds the potential to have a beneficial impact on graft atherosclerosismethods and results we assessed the effect of flavonoidrich dark chocolate compared with cocoafree control chocolate on coronary vascular and platelet function in 22 heart transplant recipients in a doubleblind randomized studycoronary vasomotion was assessed with quantitative coronary angiography and cold pressor testing before and 2 hours after ingestion of 40 g of dark 70 cocoa chocolate or control chocolate respectivelytwo hours after ingestion of flavonoidrich dark chocolate coronary artery diameter was increased significantly from 236051 to 251059 mm p001 whereas it remained unchanged after control chocolateendotheliumdependent coronary vasomotion improved significantly after dark chocolate 45114 versus 43117 in the placebo group p001platelet adhesion decreased from 4911 to 3808 p004 in the dark chocolate group but remained unchanged in the control groupconclusions dark chocolate induces coronary vasodilation improves coronary vascular function and decreases platelet adhesion 2 hours after consumptionthese immediate beneficial effects were paralleled by a significant reduction of serum oxidative stress and were positively correlated with changes in serum epicatechin concentration
