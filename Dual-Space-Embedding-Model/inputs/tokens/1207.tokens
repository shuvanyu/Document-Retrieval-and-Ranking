background cocoa is rich in flavonoids has antioxidative properties and increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide noadequate renal tissue oxygenation is crucial for the maintenance of renal functionthe goal of this study was to investigate the effect of cocoarich dark chocolate dc on renal tissue oxygenation in humans as compared to flavonoidpoor white chocolate wcmethods ten healthy volunteers with preserved kidney function mean age  sd 35  12 years 70 women bmi 21  3 kgm2 underwent blood oxygenation leveldependent magnetic resonance imaging boldmri before and 2 hours after the ingestion of 1 gkg of dc 70 cocoarenal tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of r2 maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneysthe mean r2  1t2 values in the medulla and cortex were calculated a low r2 indicating high tissue oxygenationeight participants also underwent boldmri at least 1 week later before and 2 hours after the intake of 1 gkg wcresults the mean medullary r2 was lower after dc intake compared to baseline 282  13 s1 vs 296  13 s1 p  004 whereas cortical and medullary r2 values did not change after wc intakethe change in medullary r2 correlated with the level of circulating epicatechines metabolites of flavonoids r  074 p  0037 and was independent of plasma renin activityconclusion this study suggests for the first time an increase of renal medullary oxygenation after intake of dark chocolatewhether this is linked to flavonoidinduced changes in renal perfusion or oxygen consumption and whether cocoa has potentially renoprotective properties merits further study
