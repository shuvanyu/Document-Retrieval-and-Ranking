a method based on solid phase extraction followed by derivatization and gas chromatographymass spectrometry analysis was validated for the determination of bisphenol a bpa in canned food productsthis method was used to analyze 78 canned food products for bpaconcentrations of bpa in canned food products differed considerably among food types but all were below the specific migration limit of 06 mgkg set by the european commission directive for bpa in food or food simulantscanned tuna products had the highest bpa concentrations in general with mean and maximum values of 137 and 534 ngg respectivelybpa concentrations in the condensed soup products were considerably higher than those in the readytoserve soup products with mean and maximum values of 105 and 189 ngg respectively for the condensed soups and 15 and 34 ngg respectively for the readytoserve soupsbpa concentrations in canned vegetable products were relatively low about 60 of the products had bpa concentrations of less than 10 nggcanned tomato paste products had lower bpa concentrations than did canned pure tomato productsthe mean and maximum bpa concentrations were 11 and 21 ngg respectively for tomato paste products and 93 and 23 ngg respectively for the pure tomato products
