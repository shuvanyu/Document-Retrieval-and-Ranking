background  aims familialadenomatous polyposis fap is an autosomaldominant disorder characterized by the development of hundreds of colorectal adenomas and eventual colorectal cancerregression of adenomas in this syndrome occurs with the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase2 inhibitors but these compounds can have considerable side effectswe evaluated the efficacy of the combination of dietderived nonprescription supplements curcumin and quercetin to regress adenomas in patients with fapmethods five fap patients with prior colectomy 4 with retained rectum and 1 with an ileal anal pouch received curcumin 480 mg and quercetin 20 mg orally 3 times a daythe number and size of polyps were assessed at baseline and after therapythe wilcoxon signedrank test was used to determine differences in the number and size of polypstreatment side effects and medication compliance also were evaluatedresults all 5 patients had a decreased polyp number and size from baseline after a mean of 6 months of treatment with curcumin and quercetinthe mean percent decrease in the number and size of polyps from baseline was 604 p  05 and 509 p  05 respectivelyminimal adverse side effects and no laboratory abnormalities were notedconclusions the combination of curcumin and quercetin appears to reduce the number and size of ileal and rectal adenomas in patients with fap without appreciable toxicityrandomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings
