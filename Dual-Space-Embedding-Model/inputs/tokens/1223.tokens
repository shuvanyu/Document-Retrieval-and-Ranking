curcumin diferuloylmethane is being considered as a potential chemopreventive agent in humansin vitro it inhibits transcription by nfkappab and the activity of lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase enzymes which facilitate tumor progressionin vivo it is protective in rodent models of chemical carcinogenesiscurcumin contains an alphabetaunsaturated ketone a reactive chemical substituent that is responsible for its repression of nfkappabin compounds other than curcumin this same electrophilic moiety is associated with inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53here we report that curcumin behaves analogously to these compoundsit disrupts the conformation of the p53 protein required for its serine phosphorylation its binding to dna its transactivation of p53responsive genes and p53mediated cell cycle arrest
