curcuma sppextracts particularly the dietary polyphenol curcumin prevent colon cancer in rodentsin view of the sparse information on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of curcumin in humans a doseescalation pilot study of a novel standardized curcuma extract in proprietary capsule form was performed at doses between 440 and 2200 mgday containing 36180 mg of curcuminfifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies received curcuma extract daily for up to 4 monthsactivity of glutathione stransferase and levels of a dna adduct m1g formed by malondialdehyde a product of lipid peroxidation and prostaglandin biosynthesis were measured in patients blood cellsoral curcuma extract was well tolerated and doselimiting toxicity was not observedneither curcumin nor its metabolites were detected in blood or urine but curcumin was recovered from fecescurcumin sulfate was identified in the feces of one patientingestion of 440 mg of curcuma extract for 29 days was accompanied by a 59 decrease in lymphocytic glutathione stransferase activityat higher dose levels this effect was not observedleukocytic m1g levels were constant within each patient and unaffected by treatmentradiologically stable disease was demonstrated in five patients for 24 months of treatmentthe results suggest that a curcuma extract can be administered safely to patients at doses of up to 22 g daily equivalent to 180 mg of curcumin b curcumin has low oral bioavailability in humans and may undergo intestinal metabolism and c larger clinical trials of curcuma extract are merited
