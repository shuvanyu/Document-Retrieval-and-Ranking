the genetic alterations in colorectal cancer progression are determined by one of two separate and distinct underlying pathways of genomic instabilitythe first pathway chromosomal instability is characterized by allelic losses and aneuploidythe second pathway microsatellite instability is characterized by an abundance of subtle dna mutations and diploidyalthough the genes causing chromosomal instability remain unknown microsatellite instability is caused by inactivation of a dna mismatch repair gene predominantly mlh1 or msh2microsatellite instability is present in 15 of colorectal cancers and is diagnosed by analysis of tumor dna from paraffin blocks and by demonstration of loss of mismatch repair protein expression in cancersin addition to the unique profile of genetic alterations colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability have distinct pathologic features and improved survivalfinally cancers from most patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or lynch syndrome have microsatellite instability due to germline mutations in the dna mismatch repair genesidentification of the microsatellite instability pathway has enormous implications for the clinical investigation and management of colorectal cancer patients
