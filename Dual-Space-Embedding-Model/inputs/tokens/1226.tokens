the consequences of a change from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet for 12 mo on trace element concentrations in plasma hair urine and feces were studied in 16 women and 4 menafter the diet shift intakes of zinc and magnesium did not change but that of selenium decreased by 40three months after the diet shift plasma and hair concentrations of zinc copper and selenium had decreased but those of magnesium had increased and the concentrations of mercury lead and cadmium in hair were loweralso the excretion of zinc copper and magnesium in urine and that of selenium in urine and feces had decreasedonly small changes occurred during the remaining lactovegetariandiet periodthree years later trace element concentrations had reverted towards baseline concentrations copper values were similar to baseline concentrations but data for magnesium were slightly higher and more complex patterns were observed for zinc and seleniumit is concluded that a shift to a lactovegetarian diet changes trace element status
