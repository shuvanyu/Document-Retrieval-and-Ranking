highlevel cadmium cd exposure has long been known to induce nephropathy severe osteoporosis and fractures in humansmore recent epidemiology however reveals that in populations not known to have important industrial exposure to this heavy metal highnormal blood or urine cd levels correlate with increased risk for vascular disorders cancers diabetes and total mortality as well as osteoporosis and nephropathysince these disorders appear unlikely to expedite cd absorption and since cd has promoted these pathologies in rodent studies it seems reasonable to conclude that cd is an important mediating risk factor for these disorders in humansavoiding tobacco smoke or frequent ingestion of shellfish or organ meats can lessen humans exposure to cd but the chief dietary sources of cd are plantderived foods  green leafy vegetables whole grains tubers and root vegetables  typically recommended for their healthsupportive properties indeed among nonsmokers vegans tend to have the highest cd body burdenfortunately iron sufficiency and ample dietary intakes of calcium magnesium and zinc can impede absorption of dietary cd both by downregulating intestinal expression of mineral transporters and by directly competing with cd for access to these transporterscorrection of iron deficiency appears to be of particular importance for controlling cd absorptionmoreover zinc supplementation can counteract the toxicity of cd already in the body via induction of metallothionein which binds cd avidly via its sulfhydryl groups so long as it remains sequestered in this form cd is innocuouszinc supplementation may in any case be recommendable as optimal zinc status exerts protective antiinflammatory antioxidant and immunosupportive effectsinasmuch as the toxicity of cd appears to be mediated in large part by oxidative stress ingestion of spirulina lipoic acid melatonin and nacetylcysteine may also have potential for mitigating the risk associated with cd exposure as suggested by rodent studieshence although cd may prove to be a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in humans practical strategies for limiting its absorption and pathogenic impact are at handcopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
