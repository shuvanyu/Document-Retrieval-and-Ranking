twenty three adults ingested 203pb as lead acetate on the 12th hour of a 19 h fastretention measured 7 days later in a wholebody counter was 61 and wholebody turnover rates suggested that initial uptake had been considerably greaterbalanced meals eaten with 203pb reduced lead uptake to 4 and the influence of the food lasted for up to 3 h the effects of phytate ethylenediaminetetra acetate edta caffeine alcohol glucose a liquid meal and a light snack were tested separately with intermediate resultsthe effect of a meal was probably largely due to its content of calcium and phosphate salts but lead uptake was probably further reduced by phytate which is plentiful in whole cereals and it was probably increased by a factor in milkuptake with skimmed milk was the same as with whole milk and we suggested that the factor was not fatcomestibles with low mineral and phytate contents reduced lead uptake by intermediate amounts possibly by stimulation of digestive secretionsthe avid uptake of lead during a fast the large reduction of lead uptake with meals and the likelihood of variations in gastricemptying rates and dietary habits may be major causes of variation in body burdens of lead in the population
