the role of cadmium cd bioaccessibility in risk assessment is less well studiedthe aim of this study was to assess human health risk to cd through inhalation and seafood consumption by incorporating bioaccessibilitythe relationships between trophically available cd and bioaccessibility were constructed based on available experimental datawe estimated cd concentrations in human urine and blood via daily intake from seafood consumption and inhalation based on a physiologicallybased pharmacokinetic pbpk modela hillbased doseresponse model was used to assess human renal dysfunction and peripheral arterial disease risks for longterm cd exposurehere we showed that fish had higher bioaccessibility 837 than that of shellfish 732 for human ingestionour results indicated that glomerular and tubular damage among different genders and smokers ranged from 1803 to 1818our analysis showed that nonsmokers had 50 probability of peripheral arterial disease level exceeding from 328 to 880smoking populations had 23 folds higher morbidity risk of peripheral arterial disease than those of nonsmokersour study concluded that the adverse effects of cd exposure are exacerbated when high seafood consumption coincides with cigarette smokingour work provides a framework that could more accurately address risk dose dependency of cd hazardcopyright  2012 elsevier bv all rights reserved
