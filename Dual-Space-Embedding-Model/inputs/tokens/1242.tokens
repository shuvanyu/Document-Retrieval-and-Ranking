cadmium is a toxic element ubiquitous in the environment which damages biological systems in various waysthe major source of cadmium exposure is foodhigh cadmium content in the soil leads to high cadmium concentrations in certain plants such as grains above all surface layers and germs oil or nonoil seeds fruit and vegetablesthese food commodities are the crucial components of a vegetarian nutritionblood cadmium concentrations were measured in two nonsmoking population groups the vegetarian group n  80 and the nonvegetarian control group of general population on traditional mixed diet n  84the significantly higher blood cadmium content 178  022 vs 045  004 microgl was measured in vegetarian grouphealthy risk values  5 microgl were found in 6 vegetarians vs no nonvegetarianthe highest cadmium concentration 315  077 microgl was measured in vegan subgroup plant food only n  10 and that value decreased with increasing animal food consumption 175  036 microgl lactovegetarian and lactoovovegetarian subgroupadded dairy products and eggs n  41 134  021 microgi semivegetarian subgroup as a previous subgroup and added white meat n  291risk vegetarians vs nonrisk vegetarians consume significantly higher amounts of whole grain products grain sprouts and oil seedsblood cadmium content is directly influenced by age r  032 p  0001 by whole grain product intake r  066 p  0001 and by duration of vegetarianism r  05 p  0001oxidative stress plays a major role in chronic cadmium induced hepatic and renal toxicity as well as in other consequences of cadmium injuriesvegetarians have significantly higher plasma concentrations of natural antioxidantsthe sufficient antioxidative protection against cadmium induced free radical formation in vegetarians may inhibit the harmful effects of greater cadmium intake from plant food
