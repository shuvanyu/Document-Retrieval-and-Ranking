intestinal permeability was estimated in healthy subjects after ingestion of aspirin 1212 g ibuprofen 400400 mg and indomethacin 7550 mg at midnight and an hour before starting a 51chromium labelled ethylenediaminetetraacetate absorption testintestinal permeability increased significantly from control levels following each drug and the effect was related to drug potency to inhibit cyclooxygenaseintestinal permeability increased to a similar extent after oral and rectal administration of indomethacin showing that the effect is systemically mediatedprostaglandin e2 decreased intestinal permeability significantly but failed to prevent the indomethacin induced increased intestinal permeabilitythese studies show that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs disrupt the intestinal barrier function in man and suggest that the morphological correlates of the damage may reside at the level of the intercellular junctions
