objective to study the relation between cherry intake and the risk of recurrent gout attacks among individuals with goutmethods we conducted a casecrossover study to examine associations of a set of putative risk factors with recurrent gout attacksindividuals with gout were prospectively recruited and followed online for one yearparticipants were asked about the following information when experiencing a gout attack the onset date of the gout attack symptoms and signs medications including antigout medications and potential risk factors including daily intake of cherries and cherry extract during the 2day period prior to the gout attackwe assessed the same exposure information over 2day control periodswe estimated the risk of recurrent gout attacks related to cherry intake using conditional logistic regressionresults our study included 633 individuals with goutcherry intake over a 2day period was associated with a 35 lower risk of gout attacks compared with no intake multivariate odds ratio or  065 95 ci 050085cherry extract intake showed a similar inverse association multivariate or055 95 ci 030098the effect of cherry intake persisted across subgroups by sex obesity status purine intake alcohol use diuretic use and use of antigout medicationswhen cherry intake was combined with allopurinol use the risk of gout attacks was 75 lower than periods without either exposure or025 95 ci 015042conclusions these findings suggest that cherry intake is associated with a lower risk of gout attacks
