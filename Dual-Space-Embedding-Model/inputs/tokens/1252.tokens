a limited number of studies have demonstrated that some modulators of inflammation can be altered by the consumption of sweet cherrieswe have taken a proteomics approach to determine the effects of dietary cherries on targeted gene expressionthe purpose was then to determine changes caused by cherry consumption in the plasma concentrations of multiple biomarkers for several chronic inflammatory diseases in healthy humans with modestly elevated creactive protein crp range 114 mgl mean 35 mgl normal 10 mgleighteen men and women 4561 y supplemented their diets with bing sweet cherries 280 gd for 28 d fasting blood samples were taken before the start of consuming the cherries study d 7 28 d after the initiation of cherry supplementation d 35 and 28 d after the discontinuation d 63of the 89 biomarkers assessed cherry consumption for 28 d altered concentrations of 9 did not change those of 67 and the other 13 were below the detection limitscherry consumption decreased p  005 plasma concentrations of extracellular newly identified ligand for the receptor for advanced glycation end products 290 crp 201 ferritin 203 plasminogen activator inhibitor1 199 endothelin1 137 epidermal growth factor 132 and il18 81 and increased that of il1 receptor antagonist 279 compared with corresponding values on study d 7the ferritin concentration continued to decrease between d 35 and 63 and it was significantly lower on d 63 than on d 7because the participants in this study were healthy no clinical pathology end points were measuredhowever results from the present study demonstrate that cherry consumption selectively reduced several biomarkers associated with inflammatory diseases
