objectives to investigate the antiinflammatory and antioxidative effects of anthocyanins from cherries on freunds adjuvantinduced arthritis aia in ratsmethods arthritis was induced intradermally by injection with 01 ml of complete freunds adjuvant cfa into the right hind footpad of male sprague dawley sd ratsanthocyanins at 40 20 and 10 mgkg body weight were administered orally to the treated rats for 28 days after the injectiontumour necrosis factoralpha tnfalpha in serum and prostaglandin e2 pge2 in paws were assayed by radioimmunoassay ria and antioxidative effects was assayed by measuring total antioxidative capacity taoc superoxide dismutase sod and malondialdehyde mda in serumresults anthocyanins at 40 mgkg significantly decreased the levels of tnfalpha in serum and pge2 in paws simultaneously improving the antioxidative status of aiawe found that at this dosage taoc was potentized the activity of sod increased and the level of mda in serum decreasedhowever anthocyanins at 20 and 10 mgkg had less effect on the inflammatory factors and antioxidative capacity of aiaconclusions anthocyanins have potential antiinflammatory and antioxidative effects on aia
