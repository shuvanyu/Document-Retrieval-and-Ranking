background some people who suffer an upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation diethe mortality rate was estimated at 12 in studies published before 1997 but a systematic survey of more recent data is neededbetter treatment is likely to have reduced mortalityan estimate of mortality is helpful in explaining to patients the risks of therapy especially with nsaidsmethods a systematic review of studies published before 1997 and between 1997 and 2008any study architecture was acceptable if it reported on cases who died from any cause of upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforationanalyses were conducted separately for all cases and those prescribed nsaid or aspirinresults information was available for 61067 cases 81 published since 1997 of whom 5001 diedthe mortality rate in all cases fell significantly from 116 95 confidence interval 110 to 122 in pre1997 studies to 74 72 to 76 in those published since 1997in 5526 patients taking nsaid or aspirin mortality increased from 147 136 to 158 before 1997 to 209 188 to 229 since 1997conclusion upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation still carries a finite risk of deathdifferences in study architecture population characteristics risk factors definition of mortality and reporting of outcomes impose limitations on interpreting effect sizedata published since 1997 suggest that mortality in patients suffering from an upper gastrointestinal bleed or perforation has fallen to 1 in 13 overall but remains higher at about 1 in 5 in those exposed to nsaid or aspirin
