the codex alimentarius definition of dietary fiber includes all nondigestible carbohydrate polymers with a degree of polymerization of 3 or more as dietary fiber with the proviso that they show health benefitsthe global definition if accepted by all authoritative bodies offers a chance for international harmonization in research food composition tables and food labelingits nonacceptance highlights problems that may develop when definitions vary by regionthe definition requires that the research community agrees upon physiological effects for which there is substantial scientific agreement eg fibers effects on laxation and gut health on attenuating blood lipids and blood glucose and insulin and in promoting fermentation in the large bowelthe definition also necessitates the delineation of research protocols to prove the benefits of various isolated and synthesized fibersthese should emanate from evidencebased reviews that fairly weigh epidemiological data while considering that added fibers are not reflected in many food composition databasesthey then should include wellcontrolled randomized control trials and utilize animal studies to determine mechanismsagreement on many study variables such as the type of subject and the type of baseline diet that best fits the question under investigation will also be neededfinally the definition establishes that all types of fiber can address the severe fiber consumption gap that exists throughout the world by recognizing that the combination of fiberrich and fortified foods increases fiber intake while allowing consumers to stay within allowed energy levels
