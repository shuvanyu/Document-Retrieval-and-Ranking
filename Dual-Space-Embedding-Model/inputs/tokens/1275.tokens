background there is overwhelming evidence that behavioural factors influence health but their combined impact on the general population is less well documentedwe aimed to quantify the potential combined impact of four health behaviours on mortality in men and women living in the general communitymethods and findings we examined the prospective relationship between lifestyle and mortality in a prospective population study of 20244 men and women aged 4579 y with no known cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline survey in 19931997 living in the general community in the united kingdom and followed up to 2006participants scored one point for each health behaviour current nonsmoking not physically inactive moderate alcohol intake 114 units a week and plasma vitamin c 50 mmoll indicating fruit and vegetable intake of at least five servings a day for a total score ranging from zero to fourafter an average 11 y followup the age sex body mass and social classadjusted relative risks 95 confidence intervals for allcause mortality1987 deaths for men and women who had three two one and zero compared to four health behaviours were respectively 139 121160 195 170225 252 213300 and 404 295554 p  0001 trendthe relationships were consistent in subgroups stratified by sex age body mass index and social class and after excluding deaths within 2 ythe trends were strongest for cardiovascular causesthe mortality risk for those with four compared to zero health behaviours was equivalent to being 14 y younger in chronological ageconclusions four health behaviours combined predict a 4fold difference in total mortality in men and women with an estimated impact equivalent to 14 y in chronological ageeditors summary backgroundevery day or so it seems new research shows that some aspect of lifestylephysical activity diet alcohol consumption and so onaffects health and longevityfor the person in the street all this information is confusingwhat is a healthy diet for examplealthough there are some common themes such as the benefit of eating plenty of fruit and vegetables the details often differ between studiesand exactly how much physical activity is needed to improve healthis a gentle daily walk sufficient or simply a stepping stone to doing enough exercise to make a real differencethe situation with alcohol consumption is equally confusingsmall amounts of alcohol apparently improve health but large amounts are harmfulas a result it can be hard for publichealth officials to find effective ways to encourage the behavioral changes that the scientific evidence suggests might influence the health of populationswhy was this study donethere is another factor that is hindering official attempts to provide healthy lifestyle advice to the publicalthough there is overwhelming evidence that individual behavioral factors influence health there is very little information about their combined impactif the combination of several small differences in lifestyle could be shown to have a marked effect on the health of populations it might be easier to persuade people to make behavioral changes to improve their health particularly if those changes were simple and relatively easy to achievein this study which forms part of the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic the researchers have examined the relationship between lifestyle and the risk of dying using a health behavior score based on four simply defined behaviorssmoking physical activity alcohol drinking and fruit and vegetable intakewhat did the researchers do and findbetween 1993 and 1997 about 20000 men and women aged 4579 living in norfolk uk none of whom had cancer or cardiovascular disease heart or circulation problems completed a health and lifestyle questionnaire had a health examination and had their blood vitamin c level measured as part of the epicnorfolk studya health behavior score of between 0 and 4 was calculated for each participant by giving one point for each of the following healthy behaviors current nonsmoking not physically inactive physical inactivity was defined as having a sedentary job and doing no recreational exercise moderate alcohol intake 114 units a week a unit of alcohol is half a pint of beer a glass of wine or a shot of spirit and a blood vitamin c level consistent with a fruit and vegetable intake of at least five servings a daydeaths among the participants were then recorded until 2006after allowing for other factors that might have affected their likelihood of dying for example age people with a health behavior score of 0 were four times as likely to have died in particular from cardiovascular disease than those with a score of 4people with a score of 2 were twice as likely to have diedwhat do these findings meanthese findings indicate that the combination of four simply defined health behaviors predicts a 4fold difference in the risk of dying over an average period of 11 years for middleaged and older peoplethey also show that the risk of death particularly from cardiovascular disease decreases as the number of positive health behaviors increasefinally they can be used to calculate that a person with a health score of 0 has the same risk of dying as a person with a health score of 4 who is 14 years olderthese findings need to be confirmed in other populations and extended to an analysis of how these combined health behaviors affect the quality of life as well as the risk of deathnevertheless they strongly suggest that modest and achievable lifestyle changes could have a marked effect on the health of populationsarmed with this information publichealth officials should now be in a better position to encourage behavior changes likely to improve the health of middleaged and older peopleadditional informationplease access these web sites via the online version of this summary at httpdxdoiorg101371journalpmed0050012
