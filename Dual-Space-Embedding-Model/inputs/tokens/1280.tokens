objectives to examine the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake physical activity and allcause mortality in older womendesign six cox proportional hazards models examined independent and additive relationships between physical activity carotenoids and allcause mortalityadditional models tested whether physical activity and carotenoids were conjointly related to mortalitymodels were adjusted for age education and race and ethnicitysetting baltimore marylandparticipants seven hundred thirteen women aged 70 to 79 participating in the womens health and aging studiesmeasurements total serum carotenoids a marker of fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity were measured at baselinephysical activity was measured according to kilocalorie expenditureresults during 5 years of followup 82 115 participants diedmeasured continuously physical activity improved survival hr  052 95 ci  041066 p  001the most active women were more likely to survive than the least physically active women hr  028 95 ci  013059 p  001continuous measures of carotenoids improved survival hr  067 95 ci  051089 p  01women in the highest tertile of total carotenoids were more likely to survive those in the lowest hr  050 95 ci  027091 p  03when examined in the same model continuous measures of physical activity hr  054 95 ci  042068 p  001 and carotenoids hr  076 95 ci  059098 p  04 predicted survival during followupconclusion the combination of low total serum carotenoids and low physical activity both modifiable risk factors strongly predicted earlier mortalitythese findings provide preliminary support that higher fruit and vegetable intake and exercise improve survival
