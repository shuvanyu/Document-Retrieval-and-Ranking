background chronic cutaneous complications such as pruritus are among the very frequent complaints of sulphur mustard smexposed patientsthe present trial investigated the impact of curcumin on serum inflammatory biomarkers and their association with pruritus severity and quality of life qolmethods this was a randomized doubleblind trial among 96 male iranian veterans age 3759 y who were suffering from chronic sminduced pruritic skin lesionspatients were randomly assigned to curcumin 1 gd n  46 or placebo n  50 for four weeksserum concentrations of interleukins 6 il6 and 8 il8 together with highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp and calcitonin generelated peptide cgrp were measured at baseline and at the end of the trialassessment of pruritus severity was performed using the pruritus score and qol using the dermatology life quality index dlqiresults serum il8 and hscrp were significantly reduced in both groups but the magnitude of reduction was greater in the curcumin group p  0001serum cgrp was only decreased in the curcumin group p  0001no significant change was observed in serum il6there were significant correlations between cgrp and il6 changes p  0011 and between dlqi and il8 changes p  0026 in the curcumin groupin the curcumin group changes in serum il8 concentrations were found as the significant predictor of dlqi scores p  0026 but none of the independent variables could predict pruritus scoresconclusions curcumin supplementation effectively mitigates inflammation in patients suffering from chronic sminduced cutaneous complicationsthis antiinflammatory effect might account for the observed pruritus alleviation and qol improvement by this phytochemical
