accumulated evidence shows that some phytochemicals provide beneficial effects for human healthrecently a number of mechanistic studies have revealed that direct interactions between phytochemicals and functional proteins play significant roles in exhibiting their bioactivitieshowever their binding selectivities to biological molecules are considered to be lower due to their small and simple structuresin this study we found that zerumbone a bioactive sesquiterpene binds to numerous proteins with little selectivitysimilar to heatdenatured proteins zerumbonemodified proteins were recognized by heat shock protein 90 a constitutive molecular chaperone leading to heat shock factor 1dependent heat shock protein induction in hepa1c1c7 mouse hepatoma cellsfurthermore oral administration of this phytochemical upregulated heat shock protein expressions in the livers of spraguedawley ratsinterestingly pretreatment with zerumbone conferred a thermoresistant phenotype to hepa1c1c7 cells as well as to the nematode caenorhabditis elegansit is also important to note that several phytochemicals with higher hydrophobicity or electrophilicity including phenethyl isothiocyanate and curcumin markedly induced heat shock proteins whereas most of the tested nutrients did notthese results suggest that nonspecific protein modifications by xenobiotic phytochemicals cause mild proteostress thereby inducing heat shock response and leading to potentiation of protein quality control systemswe considered these bioactivities to be xenohormesis an adaptation mechanism against xenobiotic chemical stressesheat shock response by phytochemicals may be a fundamental mechanism underlying their various bioactivities
