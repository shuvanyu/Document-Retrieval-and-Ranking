after observing a patient allergic to cat dander and pork but devoid of other allergies we prospectively screened patients known to be allergic to cat for a second sensitization to porkafter collecting the sera of 10 young patients found to contain specific ige to cat dander and pork we undertook this study to detect the possible crossreactive allergen define its molecular characteristics and evaluate its clinical relevancethrough immunoblotting techniques cat and porcine serum albumin were found to be jointly recognized moleculesthese findings were further analyzed by specific antialbumin ige titrations and crossinhibition experimentscat serum albumin cdna was obtained from cat liver and the corresponding amino acid sequence was deduced and compared to the known porcine and human serum albumin sequencesinhibition experiments showed that the spectrum of ige reactivity to cat serum albumin completely contained ige reactivity to porcine serum albumin suggesting that sensitization to cat was the primary eventin two cohorts of catallergic persons the frequency of sensitization to cat serum albumin was found to lie between 14 and 23sensitization to porcine albumin was found to lie between 3 and 10about 13 of these persons are likely to experience allergic symptoms in relation to pork consumptionsensitization to cat serum albumin should be considered a useful marker of possible crosssensitization not only to porcine serum albumin but also to other mammalian serum albumins
