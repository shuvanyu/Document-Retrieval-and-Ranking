anisakis simplex is a parasite that if present in uncooked and contaminated saltwater fish can invade the human guttwo different clinical situations are recognized the first known as a gastrointestinal disease varying from an asymptomatic episode to vomiting and diarrhea and the second classified as an adverse reaction to food characterized by a wide spectrum of allergic reactions like rhinitis conjunctivitis or even anaphylaxis causing hypotension andor shockthe intestinal epithelium the major defense system against external molecules represents an open gate for toxins and allergens if its protective function is compromisedprevious data have demonstrated a strict relationship between an altered intestinal permeability ipand worsening of the clinical manifestations in patients with adverse reactions to the foodin this article we evaluated the sensitization to a simplex among patients who referred clinical symptoms of allergyall subjects underwent commonly used alimentary skin prick test for food allergens to which ani s1 an a simplex allergen was addedin addition in a simplexsensitized subjects ipwas determined upon their enrolment to the study time 0 and after 6 months of consuming a raw fishfree diet time 6five hundred and forty subjects were screened and 170 had a positive skin prick test 87 512 of whom were positive to ani s1increased ipwas evidenced in a simplexsensitized subjects with worse clinical symptoms which receded after 6 months elimination of raw seafoodwith our data we demonstrated that the alimentary habit to eat raw fish represents a high risk for the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and we suggest that this pathological situation may constitute an ideal underestimated open gate for molecules that predispose to other more important pathologies
