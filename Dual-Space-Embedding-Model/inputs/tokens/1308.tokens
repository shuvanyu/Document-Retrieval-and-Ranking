antigal is a natural ab abundantly produced in humansit interacts specifically with the carbohydrate epitope gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnacr termed the alphagalactosyl epitopethis epitope is expressed in large amounts on thyrocytes of nonprimate mammals but not of humanswe have previously found that binding of antigal to alphagalactosyl epitopes on porcine thyrocytes results in stimulatory effects similar to those exerted by thyroidstimulating hormone thyrotropinin the present study we tested the hypothesis that antigal may contribute to graves disease gd pathogenesis by stimulation of the thyrocytes of patients with this autoimmune disorderantigal binding and stimulatory effects were assessed in primary thyrocyte culturesantigal specifically bound to gd thyrocytes and induced an increase in camp synthesis 125i uptake and dna synthesis in these cellsfurthermore the stimulatory effects of autologous sera on gd thyrocytes were greatly reduced after specific depletion of antigal from these serano binding and no stimulatory effects of antigal were observed however with normal human thyrocytes and with thyrocytes from thyrotoxic patients who lack thyroidstimulating igs or thyrotropin binding inhibiting igsthese in vitro stimulatory effects of antigal on gd thyrocytes suggest that this natural ab may contribute to the in vivo continuous stimulation of thyrocytes in gd patientsthe possibility that antigal may stimulate gd thyrocytes via interaction with aberrantly expressed alphagalactosyl epitopes on the thyroidstimulating hormone receptor is discussed
