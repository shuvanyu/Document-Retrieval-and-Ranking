medicinal plants provide an inexhaustible source of anticancer drugs in terms of both variety and mechanism of actioninduction of apoptosis is the key success of plant products as anticancer agentsthe present study was designed to determine the antiproliferative and apoptotic events of moringa oleifera leaf extract mle using human tumor kb cell line as a model systemkb cells were cultured in the presence of leaf extracts at various concentrations for 48 h and the percentage of cell viability was evaluated by mtt assaymle showed a dosedependent inhibition of cell proliferation of kb cellsthe antiproliferative effect of mle was also associated with induction of apoptosis as well as morphological changes and dna fragmentationthe morphology of apoptotic nuclei was quantified using dapi and propidium iodide stainingthe degree of dna fragmentation was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresisin addition mle at various concentrations was found to induce ros production suggesting modulation of redoxsensitive mechanismeventually hptlc analysis indicated the presence of phenolics such as quercetin and kaempferolthus these findings suggest that the leaf extracts from m oleifera had strong antiproliferation and potent induction of apoptosisthus it indicates that m oleifera leaf extracts has potential for cancer chemoprevention and can be claimed as a therapeutic target for cancercopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
