a new natural antialphagalactosyl igg antibody antigal was found to be present in high titer in the serum of every normal individual studiedthe antibody was isolated by affinity chromatography on a melibiosesepharose columnthe reactivity of the antibody was assessed by its interaction with alphagalactosyl residues on rabbit erythrocytes rabrbcthe specificity was determined by inhibition experiments with various carbohydratesthe antigal interacts with alphagalactosyl residues possibly on glycolipids of human rbc hurbc after removal of membrane proteins by treatment with pronasein addition the antigal bind specifically to normal and pathologically senescent hurbc suggesting a physiological role for this natural antibody in the aging of rbcthe ubiquitous presence of antigal in high titers throughout life implies a constant antigenic stimulationin addition to the theoretical interest in the antibody the study of the antigal reactivity seems to bear immunodiagnostic significancedecrease in the antibody titer was found to reflect humoral immunodeficiency disorders
