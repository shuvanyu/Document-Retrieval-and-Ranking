background in 2009 we reported a novel form of delayed anaphylaxis to red meat which is related to serum ige antibodies to the oligosaccharide galactosealpha13galactose alphagalmost of these patients had tolerated meat for many years previouslythe implication is that some exposure in adult life had stimulated the production of these ige antibodiesobjectives to investigate possible causes of this ige antibody response focusing on evidence related to tick bites which are common in the region where these reactions occurmethods serum assays were carried out using biotinylated proteins and extracts bound to a streptavidin immunocapresults prospective studies on ige antibodies in three subjects following tick bites showed an increase in ige to alphagal of twentyfold or greaterother evidence included i a strong correlation between histories of tick bites and ige to alphagal Ï‡2268 p0001 ii evidence that these ige antibodies are common in areas where the tick amblyomma americanum is common and iii a significant correlation between ige antibodies to alphagal and ige antibodies to proteins derived from a americanum rs075 p0001conclusion the results presented here provide evidence that tick bites are a cause or possibly the only cause of ige specific for alphagal in this area of the united statesboth the number of subjects becoming sensitized and the titer of ige antibodies to alphagal are strikinghere we report the first example of a response to an ectoparasite giving rise to an important form of food allergy
