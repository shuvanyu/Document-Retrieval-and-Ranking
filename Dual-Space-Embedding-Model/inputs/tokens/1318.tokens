the study of the expression of gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnac residues on mammalian glycoconjugates is of particular interest since as many as 1 of circulating igg antibodies in man the natural antigal antibody interact specifically with this carbohydrate residuein recent studies we have found that gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnac residues are abundant on red cells and nucleated cells of nonprimate mammals prosimians and new world monkeys but their expression is diminished in old world monkeys apes and humansin the present work we have analyzed the expression of these residues on secreted mammalian glycoproteinsfor this purpose we have developed a radioimmunoassay ria which enables the quantification of gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnac residues on the secreted glycoproteinspurified biotinylated antigal was used as the antibody in the ria and bovine thyroglobulin enriched for gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnac residues served as a solidphase antigenin this study it is reported for the first time that the evolutionary pattern of gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnac residue distribution in in vivo secreted glycoproteins is similar to that observed in membranes of cell lines and of red cellsthyroglobulin fibrinogen or igg molecules from nonprimate mammals and from new world monkeys express varying amounts of gal alpha 13gal beta 14glcnac residues ranging between 001 and 11 residues per molecule whereas no such residues are present on any of these glycoproteins of human or old world monkey originabstract truncated at 250 words
