pasteurization of milk ensures safety for human consumption by reducing the number of viable pathogenic bacteriaalthough the public health benefits of pasteurization are well established proraw milk advocate organizations continue to promote raw milk as natures perfect foodadvocacy groups claims include statements that pasteurization destroys important vitamins and that raw milk consumption can prevent and treat allergies cancer and lactose intolerancea systematic review and metaanalysis was completed to summarize available evidence for these selected claimsforty studies assessing the effects of pasteurization on vitamin levels were foundqualitatively vitamins b12 and e decreased following pasteurization and vitamin a increasedrandom effects metaanalysis revealed no significant effect of pasteurization on vitamin b6 concentrations standardized mean difference smd 266 95 confidence interval ci 540 08 p  006 but a decrease in concentrations of vitamins b1 smd 177 95 ci 257 096 p  0001 b2 smd 041 95 ci 081 001 p  005 c smd 213 95 ci 352 074 p  001 and folate smd 1199 95 ci 2095 303 p  001the effect of pasteurization on milks nutritive value was minimal because many of these vitamins are naturally found in relatively low levelshowever milk is an important dietary source of vitamin b2 and the impact of heat treatment should be further consideredraw milk consumption may have a protective association with allergy development six studies although this relationship may be potentially confounded by other farmingrelated factorsraw milk consumption was not associated with cancer two studies or lactose intolerance one studyoverall these findings should be interpreted with caution given the poor quality of reported methodology in many of the included studies
