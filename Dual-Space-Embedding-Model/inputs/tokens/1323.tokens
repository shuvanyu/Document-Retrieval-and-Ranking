naturally developing xenospecific abs are welldocumented barriers to xenograft transplantation in humans but whether analogous xenoreactive t cell immunity develops is not knownwe used an enzymelinked immunospot assay to determine the frequency and cytokine profiles of xenoreactive pbls from a panel of human volunteersbecause naive t cells produce only il2 in short term culture ifngamma production by this approach is a measure of a memory immune responsestimulation of human pbls or purified t lymphocytes with stimulator cells from inbred swine revealed a high frequency of ifngamma producers with 5fold fewer il2 producersin contrast lymphocytes obtained from neonatal umbilical cord blood contained swinespecific il2 producers but few ifngamma producers which is what one would expect to find with a naive phenotypemoreover pbls from adults with a history of abstention from pork consumption responded to swine cells with a significantly lower frequency of ifngamma producers than pbls from adults with unrestricted diets did suggesting that pork consumption may result in priming of swinespecific t cell immunityour findings provide the first evidence for naturally occurring xenospecific t cell immunity in humansthe detected strength of this memory response suggests that it will present a formidable barrier to transplantation of swine organs
