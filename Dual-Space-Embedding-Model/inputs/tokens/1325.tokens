background carbohydrate moieties are frequently encountered in food and can elicit ige responses the clinical significance of which has been unclearrecent work however has shown that ige antibodies to galactoseα13galactose αgal a carbohydrate commonly expressed on nonprimate mammalian proteins are capable of eliciting serious even fatal reactionsobjective we sought to determine whether ige antibodies to αgal are present in sera from patients who report anaphylaxis or urticaria after eating beef pork or lambmethods detailed histories were taken from patients presenting to the university of virginia allergy clinicskin prick tests spts intradermal skin tests and serum ige antibody analysis were performed for common indoor outdoor and food allergensresults twentyfour patients with ige antibodies to αgal were identifiedthese patients described a similar history of anaphylaxis or urticaria 3 to 6 hours after the ingestion of meat and reported fewer or no episodes when following an avoidance dietspts to mammalian meat produced wheals of usually less than 4 mm whereas intradermal or freshfood spts provided larger and more consistent wheal responsescaprast testing revealed specific ige antibodies to beef pork lamb cows milk cat and dog but not turkey chicken or fishabsorption experiments indicated that this pattern of sensitivity was explained by an ige antibody specific for αgalconclusion we report a novel and severe food allergy related to ige antibodies to the carbohydrate epitope αgalthese patients experience delayed symptoms of anaphylaxis angioedema or urticaria associated with eating beef pork or lamb
