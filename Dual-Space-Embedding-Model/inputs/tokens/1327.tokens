background limiting consumption of eggs which are high in cholesterol is generally recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular diseasehowever recent evidence suggests that dietary cholesterol has limited influence on serum cholesterol or cardiac riskobjective to assess the effects of egg consumption on endothelial function and serum lipids in hyperlipidemic adultsmethods randomized placebocontrolled crossover trial of 40 hyperlipidemic adults 24 women 16 men average age  599  96 years weight  763  218 kilograms total cholesterol  244  24 mgdlin the acute phase participants were randomly assigned to one of the two sequences of a single dose of three medium hardboiled eggs and a sausagecheese breakfast sandwichin the sustained phase participants were then randomly assigned to one of the two sequences of two medium hardboiled eggs and 12 cup of egg substitute daily for six weekseach treatment assignment was separated by a fourweek washout periodoutcome measures of interest were endothelial function measured as flow mediated dilatation fmd and lipid panelresults single dose egg consumption had no effects on endothelial function as compared to sausagecheese 04  19 vs 04  24 p  099daily consumption of egg substitute for 6 weeks significantly improved endothelial function as compared to egg 10  12 vs 01  15 p  001 and lowered serum total cholesterol 18  18 vs 5  21 mgdl p  001 and ldl 14  20 vs 2  19 mgdl p  001study results positive or negative are expressed in terms of change relative to baselineconclusions egg consumption was found to be nondetrimental to endothelial function and serum lipids in hyperlipidemic adults while egg substitute consumption was beneficial
