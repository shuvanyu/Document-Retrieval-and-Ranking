background the contribution of various risk factors to the burden of stroke worldwide is unknown particularly in countries of low and middle incomewe aimed to establish the association of known and emerging risk factors with stroke and its primary subtypes assess the contribution of these risk factors to the burden of stroke and explore the differences between risk factors for stroke and myocardial infarctionmethods we undertook a standardised casecontrol study in 22 countries worldwide between march 1 2007 and april 23 2010cases were patients with acute first stroke within 5 days of symptoms onset and 72 h of hospital admissioncontrols had no history of stroke and were matched with cases for age and sexall participants completed a structured questionnaire and a physical examination and most provided blood and urine sampleswe calculated odds ratios ors and populationattributable risks pars for the association of all stroke ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke with selected risk factorsfindings in the first 3000 cases n2337 78 with ischaemic stroke n663 22 with intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke and 3000 controls significant risk factors for all stroke were history of hypertension or 264 99 ci 226308 par 346 99 ci 304391 current smoking 209 175251 189 153231 waisttohip ratio 165 136199 for highest vs lowest tertile 265 188360 diet risk score 135 111164 for highest vs lowest tertile 188 112297 regular physical activity 069 053090 285 145485 diabetes mellitus 136 110168 50 2695 alcohol intake 151 118192 for more than 30 drinks per month or binge drinking 38 09144 psychosocial stress 130 106160 46 2196 and depression 135 110166 52 2798 cardiac causes 238 177320 67 4891 and ratio of apolipoproteins b to a1 189 149240 for highest vs lowest tertile 249 157371collectively these risk factors accounted for 881 99 ci 823922 of the par for all strokewhen an alternate definition of hypertension was used history of hypertension or blood pressure 16090 mm hg the combined par was 903 853937 for all strokethese risk factors were all significant for ischaemic stroke whereas hypertension smoking waisttohip ratio diet and alcohol intake were significant risk factors for intracerebral haemorrhagic strokeinterpretation our findings suggest that ten risk factors are associated with 90 of the risk of stroketargeted interventions that reduce blood pressure and smoking and promote physical activity and a healthy diet could substantially reduce the burden of strokefunding canadian institutes of health research heart and stroke foundation of canada canadian stroke network pfizer cardiovascular award merck astrazeneca and boehringer ingelheimcopyright 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
