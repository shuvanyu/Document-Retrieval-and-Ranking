background and aims high blood pressure bp is considered a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseaseamong lifestyle factors diet plays a key role in the prevention and control of high bptherefore it is important to elucidate which dietary components can exert beneficial effects on bp through modulation of endothelial function ef or by other mechanismsin this paper we review the role of nutrients foods particularly nuts and dietary patterns on bp controldata synthesis because nuts are low in sodium and contain significant amounts of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids fiber minerals such as magnesium potassium and calcium and antioxidants they have been suggested as potentially protective foods against hypertensionlimited evidence from prospective studies and clinical trials suggests that nut consumption has a beneficial effect on both bp and efhowever bp changes were a secondary outcome in nut feeding trials and no study used ambulatory bp monitoring as the standard for bp measurementsconclusions further clinical trials ideally using ambulatory bp monitoring are needed to establish the potential protective effect of nut consumption on hypertension and vascular reactivitycopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
