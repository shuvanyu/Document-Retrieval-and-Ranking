insulin resistance and the defective function of pancreatic βcells can occur several years before the development of type 2 diabetesit is necessary to investigate and clarify the integrated effects of moderatetohigh exposure to dioxins and mercury on the pancreatic endocrine functionthis crosssectional study investigated 1449 nondiabetic residents near a deserted pentachlorophenol and chloralkali factorymetabolic syndrome related factors were measured to examine associations with serum dioxin and blood mercurywe also investigated associations between insulin resistance homair  75th percentile defective pancreatic βcells function homa βcell  75th percentile serum dioxins and blood mercuryafter adjusting for confounding factors we found that insulin resistance increased with serum dioxins b  013 p  0001 and blood mercury b  001 p  0001moreover participants with higher serum dioxins or blood mercury were at a significantly increasing risk for insulin resistance ptrend  0001the joint highest tertile of serum dioxins and blood mercury was associated with elevated homair at 11 times the odds of the joint lowest tertile aor 1100 95 ci 487 2663we hypothesize that simultaneous exposure to dioxins and mercury heightens the risk of insulin resistance more than does individual exposurecopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
