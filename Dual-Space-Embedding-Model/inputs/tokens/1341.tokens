background prospective data regarding persistent organic pollutants pops and risk of type 2 diabetes t2d are limited and the results for individual pops are not entirely consistent across studiesobjectives we prospectively examined plasma pop concentrations in relation to incident t2d and summarized existing evidence in a metaanalysismethods plasma polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde and hexachlorobenzene hcb concentrations were measured in 1095 women who were free of diabetes at blood draw in 19891990 and participated in two casecontrol studies in the nurses health studywe identified 48 incident t2d cases through 30 june 2008we conducted a literature search in pubmed and embase through december 2011 to identify prospective studies on pops in relation to diabeteswe used a fixedeffects model to summarize resultsresults after multivariable adjustment plasma hcb concentration was positively associated with incident t2d pooled odds ratio or 359 95 ci 149 864 ptrend  0003 comparing extreme tertilesother pops were not significantly associated with diabetesafter pooling our results with those of six published prospective studies that included 842 diabetes cases in total we found that hcb and total pcbs both were associated with diabetes the pooled ors were 200 95 ci 113 353 i2  214 pheterogeneity  028 and 170 95 ci 128 227 i2  163 pheterogeneity  030 for hcb and total pcbs respectivelyconclusions these findings support an association between pop exposure and the risk of t2d
