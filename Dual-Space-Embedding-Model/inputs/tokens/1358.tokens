results from observational studies on the association of fish and n3 fatty acid consumption with type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm risk are conflictinghence a metaanalysis was performed to investigate this association from cohort studiesa comprehensive search was then conducted to identify cohort studies on the association of fish andor n3 fatty acid intake with t2dm riskin the highest v lowest categorical analyses the fixed or randomeffect model was selected based on the homogeneity test among studieslinear and nonlinear doseresponse relationships were also assessed by univariate and bivariate randomeffect metaregression with restricted maximum likelihood estimationin the highest v lowest categorical analyses the pooled relative risk rr of t2dm for intake of fish and n3 fatty acid was 1146 95  ci 0975 1346 and 1076 95  ci 0955 1213 respectivelyin the linear doseresponse relationship the pooled rr for an increment of one time about 105 gweek of fish intake four timesmonth and of 01 gd of n3 fatty acid intake was 1042 95  ci 1026 1058 and 1057 95  ci 1042 1073 respectivelythe significant nonlinear doseresponse associations of fish and n3 fatty acid intake with t2dm risk were not observedthe present evidence from observational studies suggests that the intake of both fish and n3 fatty acids might be weakly positively associated with the t2dm riskfurther studies are needed to confirm these results
