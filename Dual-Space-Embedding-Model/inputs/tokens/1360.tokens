background relatively high concentrations of acrylamide in commonly ingested food products such as french fries potato chips or cereals may constitute a potential risk to human healthobjective the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the possible connection between chronic ingestion of acrylamidecontaining potato chips and oxidative stress or inflammationdesign fourteen healthy volunteers mean age 35 y 8 women and 6 smokers of 20 cigarettesd were given 160 g of potato chips containing 157 microg corrected acrylamide daily for 4 wkresults an increase in acrylamidehemoglobin adducts in blood was found in all the study subjects with a mean of 431 pmol x l1 x g1 hemoglobin range 2776 p  001 in nonsmokers and 590 pmol x l1 x g1 hemoglobin range 43132 p  005 in smokersconcurrently a significant increase p  001 in the oxidized ldl highsensitivity interleukin6 highsensitivity creactive protein and gammaglutamyltransferase concentrations was observed in both smokers and nonsmokersa significant increase in reactive oxygen radical production by monocytes lymphocytes and granulocytes and an increase in cd14 expression in macrophages p  0001 were found after intake of potato chipstwentyeight days from the discontinuation of the experiment the variables under study decreased to some extentit has been shown also that acrylamide increases the production of reactive oxygen species in isolated human monocytemacrophages in vitro and decreases the cellular glutathione concentrationconclusion these novel findings seem to indicate that chronic ingestion of acrylamidecontaining products induces a proinflammatory state a risk factor for progression of atherosclerosis
