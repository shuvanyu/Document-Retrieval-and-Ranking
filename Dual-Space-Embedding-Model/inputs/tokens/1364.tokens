background acrylamide is a common dietary exposure that crosses the human placentait is classified as a probable human carcinogen and developmental toxicity has been observed in rodentsobjectives we examined the associations between prenatal exposure to acrylamide and birth outcomes in a prospective european motherchild studymethods hemoglobin hb adducts of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide were measured in cord blood reflecting cumulated exposure in the last months of pregnancy from 1101 singleton pregnant women recruited in denmark england greece norway and spain during 20062010maternal diet was estimated through foodfrequency questionnairesresults both acrylamide and glycidamide hb adducts were associated with a statistically significant reduction in birth weight and head circumferencethe estimated difference in birth weight for infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of acrylamide hb adduct levels after adjusting for gestational age and country was 132 g 95 ci 207 56 the corresponding difference for head circumference was 033 cm 95 ci 061 006findings were similar in infants of nonsmokers were consistent across countries and remained after adjustment for factors associated with reduced birth weightmaternal consumption of foods rich in acrylamide such as fried potatoes was associated with cord blood acrylamide adduct levels and with reduced birth weightconclusions dietary exposure to acrylamide was associated with reduced birth weight and head circumferenceconsumption of specific foods during pregnancy was associated with higher acrylamide exposure in uteroif confirmed these findings suggest that dietary intake of acrylamide should be reduced among pregnant women
