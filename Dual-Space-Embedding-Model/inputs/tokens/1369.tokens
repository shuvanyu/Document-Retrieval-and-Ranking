lipid raftscaveolae are membrane platforms for signaling molecules that regulate various cellular functions including cell survivalto better understand the role of rafts in tumor progression and therapeutics we investigated the effect of raft disruption on cell viability and compared raft levels in human cancer cell lines versus their normal counterpartshere we report that cholesterol depletion using methylÎ² cyclodextrin caused anoikislike apoptosis which in a431 cells involved decreased raft levels bclxl downregulation caspase3 activation and akt inactivation regardless of epidermal growth factor receptor activationcholesterol repletion replenished rafts on the cell surface and restored akt activation and cell viabilitymoreover the breast cancer and the prostate cancer cell lines contained more lipid rafts and were more sensitive to cholesterol depletioninduced cell death than their normal counterpartsthese results indicate that cancer cells contain increased levels of rafts and suggest a potential use of raftmodulating agents as anticancer drugs
