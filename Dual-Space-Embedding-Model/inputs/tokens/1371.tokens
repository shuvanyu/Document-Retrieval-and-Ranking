emerging evidence suggests that statins may decrease the risk of cancershowever available evidence on breast cancer is conflictingwe therefore examined the association between statin use and risk of breast cancer by conducting a detailed metaanalysis of all observational studies published regarding this subjectpubmed database and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for epidemiological studies published up to january 2012 investigating the relationship between statin use and breast cancerbefore metaanalysis the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneitycombined relative risk rr and 95  confidence interval ci were calculated using a randomeffects model dersimonian and laird methodsubgroup analyses sensitivity analysis and cumulative metaanalysis were also performeda total of 24 13 cohort and 11 casecontrol studies involving more than 24 million participants including 76759 breast cancer cases contributed to this analysiswe found no evidence of publication bias and evidence of heterogeneity among the studiesstatin use and longterm statin use did not significantly affect breast cancer risk rr  099 95  ci  094 104 and rr  103 95  ci  096 111 respectivelywhen the analysis was stratified into subgroups there was no evidence that study design substantially influenced the effect estimatesensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of our resultscumulative metaanalysis showed a change in trend of reporting risk of breast cancer from positive to negative in statin users between 1993 and 2011our metaanalysis findings do not support the hypothesis that statins have a protective effect against breast cancermore randomized clinical trials and observational studies are needed to confirm this association with underlying biological mechanisms in the future
