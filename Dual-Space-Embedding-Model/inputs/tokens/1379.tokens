phytoestrogens are structurally similar to estrogens and may affect breast cancer risk by mimicking estrogenicantiestrogenic propertiesin western societies whole grains and possibly soy foods are rich sources of phytoestrogensa populationbased casecontrol study in german postmenopausal women was used to evaluate the association of phytoestrogenrich foods and dietary lignans with breast cancer riskdietary data were collected from 2884 cases and 5509 controls using a validated foodfrequency questionnaire which included additional questions phytoestrogenrich foodsassociations were assessed using conditional logistic regressionall analyses were adjusted for relevant risk and confounding factorspolytomous logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations by estrogen receptor er statushigh and low consumption of soybeans as well as of sunflower and pumpkin seeds were associated with significantly reduced breast cancer risk compared to no consumption or  083 95 ci  070097 and or  066 95 ci  077097 respectivelythe observed associations were not differential by er statusno statistically significant associations were found for dietary intake of plant lignans fiber or the calculated enterolignansour results provide evidence for a reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk associated with increased consumption of sunflower and pumpkin seeds and soybeans
