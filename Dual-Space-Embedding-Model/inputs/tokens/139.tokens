consumption of a large amount of dietary fructose induces gastrointestinal intolerance and glucose has been known as an enhancer of fructose absorptionerythritol is a nonglycemic sugar alcohol and it has been suggested that erythritol is absorbed paracellularlyit was hypothesized that paracellular absorption of erythritol could also enhance paracellular absorption of fructose in healthy adultsthis is one of the proposed pathways for how additional glucose enhances the absorption of fructosethirtyseven nondiabetic healthy adults participated in a randomized doublemasked controlled crossover studyafter an overnight fast participants consumed beverages containing either 50 g fructose and 50 g glucose 50 g fructose and 333 g erythritol an equimolar concentration of fructose or 50 g fructose alonebreath hydrogen response was determined for 8 hours postprandiallygastrointestinal intolerance symptoms and the number and consistency of bowel movements were recorded for 24 hours postprandiallythe breath hydrogen area under the curve auc of the fructose and erythritol beverage was 2 times the auc of the fructose beverage and 875 times the auc of the fructose and glucose beverage p  001 respectivelycompared with fructose and glucose beverage and fructose alone frequency of watery stools increased p  05 and gastrointestinal tolerance worsened p  05 when participants consumed fructose and erythritolthese data suggest that coingestion of equimolar concentrations of fructose and erythritol increased carbohydrate malabsorptioncopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
