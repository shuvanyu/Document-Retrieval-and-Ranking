backgrounda prospective cohort study of 2512 welshmen aged 4559 living in caerphilly in 19791983 was used to investigate associations between diet and lung functionmethodsat baseline phase i and at five year follow up phase ii forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 was measured using a mcdermott spirometer and dietary data were obtained using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaireresultsgood lung function indicated by high maximum fev1 given age and height was associated with high intakes of vitamin c vitamin e Î²carotene citrus fruit apples and the frequent consumption of fruit juicessquasheslung function was inversely associated with magnesium intake but there was no evidence of an association with fatty fishfollowing adjustment for confounders including body mass index smoking history social class exercise and total energy intake only the associations with vitamin e and apples persisted with lung function estimated to be 39 ml 95 confidence interval ci 9 to 69 higher for vitamin e intakes one standard deviation sd apart and 138 ml higher 95 ci 58to 218 for those eating five or more apples per week compared with nonconsumersdecline in lung function between phases was not significantly associated with the changing intakes of apples or vitamin e an association between high average apple consumption and slow decline in lung function lost significance after adjustment for confoundersconclusionsa strong positive association is seen between lung function and the number of apples eaten per week cross sectionally consistent with a protective effect of hard fruit rather than softcitrus fruitthe recent suggestion that such effects are reversible was not supported by our longitudinal analysis
