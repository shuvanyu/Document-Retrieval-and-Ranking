background it has been postulated that dietary antioxidants may influence the expression of allergic diseases and asthmato test this hypothesis a casecontrol study was performed nested in a cross sectional study of a random sample of adults to investigate the relationship between allergic disease and dietary antioxidantsmethods the study was performed in rural general practices in grampian scotlanda validated dietary questionnaire was used to measure food intake of cases defined firstly as people with seasonal allergictype symptoms and secondly those with bronchial hyperreactivity confirmed by methacholine challenge and of controls without allergic symptoms or bronchial reactivityresults cases with seasonal symptoms did not differ from controls except with respect to the presence of atopy and an increased risk of symptoms associated with the lowest intake of zincthe lowest intakes of vitamin c and manganese were associated with more than fivefold increased risks of bronchial reactivitydecreasing intakes of magnesium were also significantly associated with an increased risk of hyperreactivityconclusions this study provides evidence that diet may have a modulatory effect on bronchial reactivity and is consistent with the hypothesis that the observed reduction in antioxidant intake in the british diet over the last 25 years has been a factor in the increase in the prevalence of asthma over this period
