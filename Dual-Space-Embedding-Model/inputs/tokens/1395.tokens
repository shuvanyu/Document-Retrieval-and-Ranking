background antioxidantrich diets are associated with reduced asthma prevalence in epidemiologic studieswe previously showed that shortterm manipulation of antioxidant defenses leads to changes in asthma outcomesobjective the objective was to investigate the effects of a highantioxidant diet compared with those of a lowantioxidant diet with or without lycopene supplementation in asthmadesign asthmatic adults n  137 were randomly assigned to a highantioxidant diet 5 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit daily n  46 or a lowantioxidant diet 2 servings of vegetables and 1 serving of fruit daily n  91 for 14 d and then commenced a parallel randomized controlled supplementation trialsubjects who consumed the highantioxidant diet received placebosubjects who consumed the lowantioxidant diet received placebo or tomato extract 45 mg lycopenedthe intervention continued until week 14 or until an exacerbation occurredresults after 14 d subjects consuming the lowantioxidant diet had a lower percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s and percentage predicted forced vital capacity than did those consuming the highantioxidant dietsubjects in the lowantioxidant diet group had increased plasma creactive protein at week 14at the end of the trial time to exacerbation was greater in the highantioxidant than in the lowantioxidant diet group and the lowantioxidant diet group was 226 95 ci 104 491 p  0039 times as likely to exacerbateof the subjects in the lowantioxidant diet group no difference in airway or systemic inflammation or clinical outcomes was observed between the groups that consumed the tomato extract and those who consumed placeboconclusions modifying the dietary intake of carotenoids alters clinical asthma outcomesimprovements were evident only after increased fruit and vegetable intake which suggests that wholefood interventions are most effectivethis trial was registered at httpwwwactrorgau as actrn012606000286549
