background free radicalmediated oxidative damage to lipids is thought to be an important process in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosisalthough previous studies have demonstrated a beneficial impact of antioxidant vitamin supplements on lipid peroxidation the effect of dietary patterns on lipid peroxidation is unknownmethods and results during the 3week runin period of a randomized trial 123 healthy individuals were fed a control diet low in fruits vegetables and dairy products with 37 of calories from fatparticipants were then randomized to consume for 8 weeks 1 the control diet 2 a diet rich in fruits and vegetables but otherwise similar to the control diet and 3 a combination diet rich in fruits vegetables and lowfat dairy products and reduced in fatserum oxygen radicalabsorbing capacity malondialdehyde an in vitro measure of lipid peroxidation and breath ethane an in vivo measure of lipid peroxidation were measured at the end of runin and intervention periodsbetween runin and intervention mean 95 ci change in oxygen radicalabsorbing capacity uml was 35 93 13 in the control diet 26 15 67 in the fruits and vegetables diet p006 compared with control and 19 22 54 in the combination diet p010 compared with controlmedian interquartile range change in ethane was 084 010 159 in the control diet 002 061 083 in the fruits and vegetables diet p004 compared with control and 100 197 025 in the combination diet p0005 compared with controlchange in malondialdehyde did not differ between dietsconclusions this study demonstrates that modification of diet can favorably affect serum antioxidant capacity and protect against lipid peroxidation
