background elevated oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defences are increasingly recognised features of asthmacarotenoids are potent dietary antioxidants that may protect against asthma by reducing oxidative damageobjectives this study aimed firstly to characterise circulating and airway levels of carotenoids in asthma compared to healthy controls in relation to dietary intakesecondly the study aimed to test whether airway lycopene defences can be improved using oral supplementsmethods induced sputum and peripheral blood samples were collected from subjects with asthma n  15 and healthy controls n  16dietary carotenoid intakes were estimated using the 24hour recall method and analysed using a modified version of the foodworks 210 nutrient calculation softwareanother group of healthy controls n  9 were supplemented with 20 mgday lycopene for 4 weekscarotenoids betacarotene lycopene alphacarotene betacryptoxanthin luteinzeaxanthin were measured by hplcresults despite similar dietary intake whole blood levels of total carotenoids lycopene lutein betacryptoxanthin alphacarotene and betacarotene were significantly lower in asthma than controlshowever there were no differences in plasma or sputum carotenoid levelsinduced sputum carotenoid levels were significantly lower than plasma and whole blood levels but correlated strongly with plasma levels r  0798 p  0001although there were no overall increases in either plasma or sputum lycopene levels following supplementation changes in airway lycopene levels correlated with changes in plasma levels r  0908 p  0002conclusions whole blood but not plasma or sputum carotenoid levels are deficient in asthmaplasma carotenoid levels reflect airway carotenoid levels and when plasma levels are improved using oral supplements this is reflected in the airways
