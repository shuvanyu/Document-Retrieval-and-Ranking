the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood isaac phase one showed large worldwide variations in the prevalence of symptoms of asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema up to 10 to 20 fold between countriesecological analyses were undertaken with isaac phase one data to explore factors that may have contributed to these variations and are summarised and reviewed herein isaac phase one the prevalence of symptoms in the past 12 months of asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema were estimated from studies in 463801 children aged 13  14 years in 155 centres in 56 countries and in 257800 children aged 67 years in 91 centres in 38 countriesecological analyses were undertaken between symptom prevalence and the following gross national product per capita gnp food intake immunisation rates tuberculosis notifications climatic factors tobacco consumption pollen antibiotic sales paracetamol sales and outdoor air pollutionsymptom prevalence of all three conditions was positively associated with gnp trans fatty acids paracetamol and women smoking and inversely associated with food of plant origin pollen immunisations tuberculosis notifications air pollution and men smokingthe magnitude of these associations was small but consistent in direction between conditionsthere were mixed associations of climate and antibiotic sales with symptom prevalencethe potential causality of these associations warrant further investigationfactors which prevent the development of these conditions or where there is an absence of a positive correlation at a population level may be as important from the policy viewpoint as a focus on the positive risk factorsinterventions based on small associations may have the potential for a large public health benefit
