an increase in asthma and atopic disease has been recorded in many countries where society has become more prosperouswe have investigated two possible explanations a reduction in childhood infections and a change in dietin a cohort of people followed up since 1964 originally selected as a random sample of primary school children we have investigated the relevance of family size and the common childhood infectious diseases to development of eczema hay fever and asthmaalthough membership of a large family reduced risks of hay fever and eczema but not asthma this was not explained by the infections the child had sufferedindeed the more infections the child had had the greater the likelihood of asthma although measles gave a modest measure of protectionwe have investigated dietary factors in two separate studiesin the first we have shown the risks of bronchial hyperreactivity are increased sevenfold among those with the lowest intake of vitamin c while the lowest intake of saturated fats gave a 10fold protectionin the second we have shown that the risk of adultonset wheezy illness is increased fivefold by the lowest intake of vitamin e and doubled by the lowest intake of vitamin c these results were supported by direct measurements of the vitamins and triglycerides in plasmawe have proposed that changes in the diet of pregnant women may have reflected those observed in the population as a whole and that these may have resulted in the birth of cohorts of children predisposed to atopy and asthmathe direct test of this is to study the diet and nutritional status of a large cohort of pregnant women and to follow their offspring forwardthis is our current research
