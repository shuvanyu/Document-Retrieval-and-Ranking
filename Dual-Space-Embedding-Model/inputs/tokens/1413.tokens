background inorganic arsenic ias causes cancer and possibly other adverse health outcomesarsenicbased drugs are permitted in poultry production however the contribution of chicken consumption to ias intake is unknownobjectives we sought to characterize the arsenic species profile in chicken meat and estimate bladder and lung cancer risk associated with consuming chicken produced with arsenicbased drugsmethods conventional antibioticfree and organic chicken samples were collected from grocery stores in 10 us metropolitan areas from december 2010 through june 2011we tested 116 raw and 142 cooked chicken samples for total arsenic and we determined arsenic species in 65 raw and 78 cooked samples that contained total arsenic at  10 µgkg dry weightresults the geometric mean gm of total arsenic in cooked chicken meat samples was 30 µgkg 95 ci 25 36among the 78 cooked samples that were speciated ias concentrations were higher in conventional samples gm  18 µgkg 95 ci 14 23 than in antibioticfree gm  07 µgkg 95 ci 05 10 or organic gm  06 µgkg 95 ci 05 08 samplesroxarsone was detected in 20 of 40 conventional samples 1 of 13 antibioticfree samples and none of the 25 organic samplesias concentrations in roxarsonepositive samples gm  23 µgkg 95 ci 17 31 were significantly higher than those in roxarsonenegative samples gm  08 µgkg 95 ci 07 10cooking increased ias and decreased roxarsone concentrationswe estimated that consumers of conventional chicken would ingest an additional 011 µgday ias in an 82g serving compared with consumers of organic chickenassuming lifetime exposure and a proposed cancer slope factor of 257 per milligram per kilogram of body weight per day this increase in arsenic exposure could result in 37 additional lifetime bladder and lung cancer cases per 100000 exposed personsconclusions conventional chicken meat had higher ias concentrations than did conventional antibioticfree and organic chicken meat samplescessation of arsenical drug use could reduce exposure and the burden of arsenicrelated disease in chicken consumers
