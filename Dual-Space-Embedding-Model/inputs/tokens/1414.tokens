there is now compelling evidence that developmental exposure to chemicals from our environment contributes to disease later in life with animal models supporting this concept in reproductive metabolic and neurodegenerative diseasesin contrast data regarding how developmental exposures impact the susceptibility of the immune system to functional alterations later in life are surprisingly scantgiven that the immune system forms an integrated network that detects and destroys invading pathogens and cancer cells it provides the bodys first line of defensethus the consequences of earlylife exposures that reduce immune function are profoundthis review summarizes available data for pollutants such as cigarette smoke and dioxinlike compounds which consistently support the idea that developmental exposures critically impact the immune systemthese findings suggest that exposure to common chemicals from our daily environment represent overlooked contributors to the fact that infectious diseases remain among the top five causes of death worldwide
