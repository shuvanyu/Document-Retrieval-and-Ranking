persistent organic pollutants pops exert harmful effects on cognitive endocrine and immune functions and bioaccumulate in the environment and human tissuesthe aim of this study was to investigate the body burden of several pops in the adult population n246 and their association to diet and other lifestyle factors in a swedish national surveyserum concentrations of several polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and the pesticides hexachlorobenzene hcb βhexachlorocyclohexane βhch chlordane compounds and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde were determined by liquidliquid extraction silica column cleanup and gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometrydiet was assessed using 4day food records and complementary dietary and lifestyle factors by questionnairefish intake was additionally assessed by plasma fatty acid compositionclustering of the compounds revealed that pcbs were separated into two clusters one including lowchlorinated pcb 28 and 52 and the other highchlorinated mono and diortho pcbs suggesting similarities and dissimilarities in exposure sources and possibly also toxicokineticsmen had 24 and 32 higher levels of pcb 138180 and chlordane compounds respectively compared with womenthis may partly be explained by elimination of the pops among women reporting a history of breastfeedingthe proportion of very longchain n3 fatty acids in plasma were positively correlated with the pollutants r024 pcb 28 r033 pcb 118 r035 pcb 138180 r029 hcb r018 βhch r034 chlordane compounds r034 ppdde p0005individuals consuming fatty baltic fish1 time per months had 45 higher serum levels of pcb 118 compared with nonconsumerslevels of pcb 28 were associated with the age of the residential buildingto conclude the populationdistributed approach of surveying dietary habits lifestyle factors and pop body burdens made it possible to identify personal characteristics associated with the pop body burdens in swedencopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
