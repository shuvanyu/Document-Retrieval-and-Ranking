dietary restriction dr and reduced growth factor signaling both elevate resistance to oxidative stress reduce macromolecular damage and increase lifespan in model organismsin rodents both dr and decreased growth factor signaling reduce the incidence of tumors and slow down cognitive decline and agingdr reduces cancer and cardiovascular disease and mortality in monkeys and reduces metabolic traits associated with diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer in humansneoplasias and diabetes are also rare in humans with loss of function mutations in the growth hormone receptordr and reduced growth factor signaling may thus slow aging by similar evolutionarily conserved mechanismswe review these conserved antiaging pathways in model organisms discuss their link to disease prevention in mammals and consider the negative side effects that might hinder interventions intended to extend healthy lifespan in humans
