tuberculosis tb is a major cause of mortality responsible for 168 million deaths worldwide in 2009the global prevalence of latent mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is estimated to be 32 and this carries a 520 lifetime risk of reactivation diseasethe emergence of drugresistant organisms necessitates the development of new agents to enhance the response to antimicrobial therapy for active tbvitamin d was used to treat tb in the preantibiotic era and its active metabolite 125dihydoxyvitamin d has long been known to enhance the immune response to mycobacteria in vitrovitamin d deficiency is common in patients with active tb and several clinical trials have evaluated the role of adjunctive vitamin d supplementation in its treatmentresults of these studies are conflicting reflecting variation between studies in baseline vitamin d status of participants dosing regimens and outcome measuresvitamin d deficiency is also recognised to be highly prevalent among people with latent m tuberculosis infection in both high and lowburden settings and there is a wealth of observational epidemiological evidence linking vitamin d deficiency with increased risk of reactivation diseaserandomised controlled trials of vitamin d supplementation for the prevention of active tb have yet to be performed howeverthe conduct of such trials is a research priority given the safety and low cost of vitamin d supplementation and the potentially huge public health consequences of positive results
