amino acids play fundamental roles in the cell both as the building blocks of new proteins and as metabolic precursorsto adapt to their limitation during periods of protein starvation multiple adaptive mechanisms have evolved including a rapid cessation of new protein synthesis an increase in amino acid biosynthesis and transport and autophagyhere we discuss what we currently know about how amino acid limitation is sensed and how this sensing might be transmitted to mtorc1 to regulate protein synthesis and autophagycopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
