background relative risk estimates suggest that effective implementation of behaviors commonly advocated in preventive medicine should increase life expectancy although there is little direct evidenceobjective to test the hypothesis that choices regarding diet exercise and smoking influence life expectancymethods a total of 34 192 california seventhday adventists 75 of those eligible were enrolled in a cohort and followed up from 1976 to 1988a mailed questionnaire provided dietary and other exposure information at study baselinemortality for all subjects was ascertained by matching to state death tapes and the national death indexresults california adventists have higher life expectancies at the age of 30 years than other white californians by 728 years 95 confidence interval 659797 years in men and by 442 years 95 confidence interval 396488 years in women giving them perhaps the highest life expectancy of any formally described populationcommonly observed combinations of diet exercise body mass index past smoking habits and hormone replacement therapy in women can account for differences of up to 10 years of life expectancy among adventistsa comparison of life expectancy when these factors take highrisk compared with lowrisk values shows independent effects that vary between 106 and 274 years for different variablesthe effect of each variable is assessed with all others at either medium or highrisk levelsconclusions choices regarding diet exercise cigarette smoking body weight and hormone replacement therapy in combination appear to change life expectancy by many yearsthe longevity experience of adventists probably demonstrates the beneficial effects of more optimal behaviors
