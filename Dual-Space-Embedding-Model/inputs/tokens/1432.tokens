many experts in the biology of ageing believe that pharmacological interventions to slow ageing are a matter of when rather than ifa leading target for such interventions is the nutrient response pathway defined by the mechanistic target of rapamycin mtorinhibition of this pathway extends lifespan in model organisms and confers protection against a growing list of agerelated pathologiescharacterized inhibitors of this pathway are already clinically approved and others are under developmentalthough adverse side effects currently preclude use in otherwise healthy individuals drugs that target the mtor pathway could one day become widely used to slow ageing and reduce agerelated pathologies in humans
