background the bloodtype diet advises individuals to eat according to their abo blood group to improve their health and decrease risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseasehowever the association between blood typebased dietary patterns and health outcomes has not been examinedthe objective of this study was to determine the association between bloodtype diets and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health and whether an individuals abo genotype modifies any associationsmethods subjects n  1455 were participants of the toronto nutrigenomics and health studydietary intake was assessed using a onemonth 196item food frequency questionnaire and a diet score was calculated to determine relative adherence to each of the four bloodtype dietsabo blood group was determined by genotyping rs8176719 and rs8176746 in the abo geneancova with age sex ethnicity and energy intake as covariates was used to compare cardiometabolic biomarkers across tertiles of each bloodtype diet scoreresults adherence to the typea diet was associated with lower bmi waist circumference blood pressure serum cholesterol triglycerides insulin homair and homabeta p005adherence to the typeab diet was also associated with lower levels of these biomarkers p005 except for bmi and waist circumferenceadherence to the typeo diet was associated with lower triglycerides p00001matching the bloodtype diets with the corresponding blood group did not change the effect size of any of these associationsno significant association was found for the typeb dietconclusions adherence to certain bloodtype diets is associated with favorable effects on some cardiometabolic risk factors but these associations were independent of an individuals abo genotype so the findings do not support the bloodtype diet hypothesis
