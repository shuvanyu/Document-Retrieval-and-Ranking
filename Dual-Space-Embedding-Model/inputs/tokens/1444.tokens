we tested the effects of feeding a diet very high in fiber from fruit and vegetablesthe levels fed were those which had originally inspired the dietary fiber hypothesis related to colon cancer and heart disease prevention and also may have been eaten early in human evolutionten healthy volunteers each took 3 metabolic diets of 2 weeks durationthe diets were highvegetable fruit and nut veryhighfiber 55 g1000 kcal starchbased containing cereals and legumes early agricultural diet or lowfat contemporary therapeutic dietall diets were intended to be weightmaintaining mean intake 2577 kcaldcompared with the starchbased and lowfat diets the highfiber vegetable diet resulted in the largest reduction in lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol 33  4 p 001 and the greatest fecal bile acid output 113  030 gd p 002 fecal bulk 906  130 gd p 001 and fecal shortchain fatty acid outputs 78  13 mmold p 001nevertheless due to the increase in fecal bulk the actual concentrations of fecal bile acids were lowest on the vegetable diet 12 mgg wet weight p 002maximum lipid reductions occurred within 1 weekurinary mevalonic acid excretion increased p 036 on the highvegetable diet reflecting large fecal steroid losseswe conclude that very highvegetable fiber intakes reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease and possibly colon cancervegetable and fruit fibers therefore warrant further detailed investigationcopyright 2001 by wbsaunders company
