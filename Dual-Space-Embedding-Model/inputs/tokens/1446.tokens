large differences exist between human populations in the frequency of colonic cancerepidemiological evidence indicates that these differences are strongly influenced by country of residence and a negative correlation has been found between the fiber content of the diet and frequency of colonic cancerthis has prompted the hypothesis that highfiber diets are in some way protectivehowever reanalysis of the dietary data provides equally strong support for the hypothesis that the protective element may be phytic acid inositol hexaphosphatethis heat and acidstable substance is present in high concentration in many food items including cereal grains nuts and seedsphytic acid forms chelates with various metals and suppresses damaging ironcatalyzed redox reactionsinasmuch as colonic bacteria have been shown to produce oxygen radicals in appreciable amounts dietary phytic acid might suppress oxidant damage to intestinal epithelium and neighboring cellsindeed rapidly accumulating data from animal models indicate that dietary supplementation with phytic acid may provide substantial protection against experimentally induced colonic cancershould further investigations yield additional support for this hypothesis purposeful amplification of dietary phytic acid content would represent a simple method for reducing the risk of colonic carcinogenesis
