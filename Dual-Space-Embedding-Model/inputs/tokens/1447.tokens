background we have shown that inositol hexaphosphate ip6 a natural compound and a potent anticancer agent inhibited cancer cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ecm proteins thereby leading to inhibition of cell migration and invasioncell adhesion to ecm is mediated by specific cell surface integrins which transduce intracellular signals through their interaction and activation of other proteins that are recruited to the focal adhesionwe hypothesize that ip6 decreases cell adhesion by suppressing the integrin receptors and their subsequent signaling pathwaymaterials and methods we analyzed integrin expressions of the highly invasive estrogen receptornegative human breast cancer mdamb 231 cells exposed to ip6 by flow cytometrythe expression of focal adhesion proteins was investigated by immunocytochemistry and western blottingresults ip6 treatment caused a significant p  0005 decrease in the expression of integrin heterodimers alpha 2 beta 1 collagen receptor alpha 5 beta 1 fibronectin receptor and alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptor flow cytometry showed that it was the alpha 5 subunit that was downregulated   0001however the expression of the alpha 2 alpha v beta 1 and beta 3 subunits were not affected by ip6 treatmentwhen the expression of integrins on the cell surface was assessed there was a dramatic 82 decrease in the expression of alpha 5 beta 1 on ip6treated cells p  00001 indicating a decrease in cell surface expression of the heterodimersno effect was seen when inositol hexasulfate is6 an analogue of ip6 was used as a controlimmunocytochemistry showed a lack of clustering of paxillin tyrosinephosphorylated proteins in ip6treated cells were discontinuous and scattered around the cell periphery whereas the patterns were more dense and localized in control cellsconsistent with these observations focal adhesion kinase fak autophosphorylation at tyrosine397 residue was suppressed albeit modestly by ip6 treatment suggesting a downregulation in the integrinmediated signaling pathwayconclusion the results of this study indicate that ip6induced inhibition of cancer cell adhesion migration and invasion may be mediated through the modulation of integrin dimerization cell surface expression and integrinassociated signaling pathway
