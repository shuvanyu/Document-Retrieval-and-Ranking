inositol hexaphosphate ip6 has anticancer properties but recently other extracellular functions have been observed for ip6 including enhancing superoxide production and phagocytosis by neutrophils in the presence of microbial stimulithis study investigated other inflammatory functions of ip6 on adherent neutrophilsthe effect of ip6 on the release of il8 tumour necrosis factor tnfalpha and il6 by neutrophils attached to either plastic or laminin for up to 6 hours in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or nformylmetleuphe fmlp was investigatedan increase in il8 secretion by stimulated cells occurred in the presence of ip6the incubation of cells attached to laminin with ip6 alone 100250 bm did not effect cell morphology but in the presence of 107 m fmlp altered cell shapea direct effect of ip6 on cell function was to trigger a sustained assembly of factinthus exposure of neutrophils to low levels of ip6 appears to modulate selective neutrophil functions
