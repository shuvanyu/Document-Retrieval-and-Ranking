objective to assess the effects of krill oil on blood lipids specifically total cholesterol triglycerides lowdensity lipoprotein ldl and highdensity lipoprotein hdlmethods a multicenter threemonth prospective randomized study followed by a threemonth controlled followup of patients treated with 1 g and 15 g krill oil dailypatients with hyperlipidemia able to maintain a healthy diet and with blood cholesterol levels between 194 and 348 mg per dl were eligible for enrollment in the triala sample size of 120 patients 30 patients per group was randomly assigned to one of four groupsgroup a received krill oil at a body mass index bmidependent daily dosage of 23 g dailypatients in group b were given 115 g krill oil daily and group c was given fish oil containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid epa and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid dha per gram of oil at a dose of 3 g dailygroup d was given a placebo containing microcrystalline cellulosethe krill oil used in this study was neptune krill oil provided by neptune technologies and bioresources laval quebec canadaoutcome measures primary parameters tested baseline and 90day visit were total blood cholesterol triglycerides ldl hdl and glucoseresults krill oil 13 g per day bmidependent was found to be effective for the reduction of glucose total cholesterol triglycerides ldl and hdl compared to both fish oil and placeboconclusions the results of the present study demonstrate within high levels of confidence that krill oil is effective for the management of hyperlipidemia by significantly reducing total cholesterol ldl and triglycerides and increasing hdl levelsat lower and equal doses krill oil was significantly more effective than fish oil for the reduction of glucose triglycerides and ldl levels
