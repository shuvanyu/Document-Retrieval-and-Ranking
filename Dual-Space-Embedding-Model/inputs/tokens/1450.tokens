the functional properties including antioxidant and chemopreventative capacities as well as the inhibitory effects on angiotensinconverting enzyme ace αglucosidase and pancreatic lipase of three australiangrown faba bean genotypes nura rossa and tficas48313 were investigated using an array of in vitro assayschromatograms of online post column derivatisation assay coupled with hplc revealed the existence of active phenolics hump in the coloured genotypes which was lacking in the whitecoloured breeding line tficas48313roasting reduced the phenolic content and diminished antioxidant activity by 1040  as measured by the reagentbased assays diphenylpicrylhydrazyl 22azinobis3ethylbenzthiazoline6sulphonic acid and oxygen radical absorbance capacity in all genotypescell culturebased antioxidant activity assay cellular antioxidant activity showed an increase of activity in the coloured genotypes after roastingfaba bean extracts demonstrated cellular protection ability against h₂o₂induced dna damage assessed using raw2647 cells and inhibited the proliferation of all human cancer cell lines bl13 ags hep g2 and ht29 evaluatedhowever the effect of faba bean extracts on the nontransformed human cells ccd18co was negligibleflow cytometric analyses showed that faba bean extracts successfully induced apoptosis of hl60 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cellsthe faba bean extracts also exhibited ace αglucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activitiesoverall extracts from nura buffcoloured and rossa redcoloured were comparable while tficas48313 whitecoloured contained the lowest phenolic content and exhibited the least antioxidant and enzyme inhibition activitiesthese results are important to promote the utilisation of faba beans in human diets for various health benefits
