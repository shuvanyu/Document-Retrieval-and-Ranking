a significant anticancer activity of the naturally occurring carbohydrate inositol hexaphosphate ip6 has been reported against numerous cancer modelssince tumors require angiogenesis for growth and metastasis we hypothesize that ip6 reduces tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesisbecause angiogenesis depends on the interaction between endothelial and tumor cells we investigated the effect of ip6 on bothip6 inhibited the proliferation and induced the differentiation of endothelial cells in vitro the growth of bovine aortic endothelial cells baecs evaluated by mtt proliferation assay was inhibited in a dosedependent manner ic50  074 mmthe combination of ip6 and vasostatin a calreticulin fragment with antiangiogenic activity was synergistically superior in growth inhibition than either compoundip6 inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell huvec tube formation in vitro capillary differentiation on a reconstituted extracellular matrix matrigel and disrupted preformed tubesip6 significantly reduced basic fibroblast growth factor bfgfinduced vessel formation p  001 in vivo in matrigel plug assayexposure of hepg2 a human hepatoma cell line to ip6 for 8 h resulted in a dosedependent decrease in the mrna levels of vascular endothelial growth factor vegf as assessed by rtpcrip6 treatment of hepg2 cells for 24 h also significantly reduced the vegf protein levels in conditioned medium in a concentrationdependent manner p  0012thus ip6 has an inhibitory effect on induced angiogenesis
