there are now extensive scientific data suggesting the potential role of dietary and nondietary phytochemicals in the prevention and control of prostate cancer pca growth and progressionpca is a disease of elderly male populations with a relatively slower rate of growth and progression as compared to most other cancers and therefore is a candidate disease for preventive interventionoverall pca growth and progression involve aberrant mitogenic and survival signaling and deregulated cell cycle progression accompanied by gradual accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes over a period of yearsseveral mechanisms including overexpression of growth survival and angiogenic factors and their receptors together with a lossdecrease of tumor suppressor p53 retinoblastoma and cyclindependent kinase inhibitor have been implicated in pca growth and progressiontherefore phytochemicals targeting these molecular events could have a promising role in pca prevention andor therapyinositol hexaphosphate ip6 is a major constituent of most cereals legumes nuts oil seeds and soybeantaken orally as an overthecounter dietarynutrient supplement and is recognised as offering several health benefits without any known toxicityin vitro anticancer efficacy of ip6 has been observed in many human mouse and rat prostate cancer cellscompleted studies also show that oral feeding of ip6 inhibits human pca xenograft growth in nude mice without toxicityin a recently completed pilot study we observed similar preventive effects of ip6 on prostate tumorigenesis in the tramp modelmechanistic studies indicate that ip6 targets mitogenic and survival signaling as well as cell cycle progression in pca cellsip6 is also shown to target molecular events associated with angiogenesismoreover ip6 has pleiotropic molecular targets for its overall efficacy against pca and therefore could be a suitable candidate agent for preventive intervention of this malignancy in humans
