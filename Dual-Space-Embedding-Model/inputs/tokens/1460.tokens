a hospitalbased casecontrol study of diet and colorectal cancer was conducted among chinese in singapore who constitute 77 of the populationa total of 203 cases and 425 controls were includeda history of the usual dietary intake one year prior to interview was taken using a quantitative food frequency questionnairedaily intakes of nutrients and selected food items were computed and stratified by tertiles of the control range to assess risk in low medium and highintake categorieseffects were adjusted in analysis for age sex chinese dialect group and occupationfor cancers of colon and rectum combined significant observations were a protective effect of high cruciferous vegetable intake or  050 p less than 001 and a predisposing effect of a high meatvegetable consumption ratio or  177 p less than 005similar results were observed for colon cancer alonefor rectal cancer alone only 71 cases significant p less than 005 protective effects were observed for high intakes of protein or  061 fibre or  046 betacarotene or  054 cruciferous vegetables or  051 and total vegetables or  051when further assessed by multiple logistic regression tests for trend and assessment of risk in the extreme highest and lowest quintiles of the control range the factors consistently significant were cruciferous vegetable intake and the meatvegetable ratioa particularly high relative risk was also noted in association with low coffee consumption or  159 with p less than 005 for trendno consistent trends were noted for fat or fibre intakesfor nondietary variables investigated a history of cholecystectomy increased the risk of both cancers combined or  343 p less than 005 and colon cancer alone or  439 p less than 001this study in an asian population of countries of southern and eastern asia newly undergoing industrialization and in which rapid economic change is reflected in changing cancer patterns suggests that the protective effects of certain dietary constituents notably the cruciferous vegetables may be more important than the hitherto stressed carcinogenic potential of fat and protein
