nonstarch polysaccharide nsp intake was measured in representative samples of 30 men aged 5059 in 2 urban and 2 rural scandinavian populations that exhibited a 34 fold difference in incidence of large bowel cancerintake was measured by chemical analysis of complete duplicate portions of all food eaten over one day by each individualnsp intakes showed a ruralurban gradient with 184  78 gday in rural finland and 180  64 gday in rural denmark versus 145  54 gday in urban finland and 132  48 gday in urban denmarknsp intakes were also calculated using food tables from weighed food records kept over 4 days one of which was the day on which the duplicate collection was madeintakes were 225 gday higher with this method than with direct chemical analysis mainly because published tables of values have become outdated and inaccurate as a result of improved methods for measuring nsp in foodindividual variation from day to day in nsp intake was considerableaverage nsp intake and intake of some of its component sugars were inversely related to colon cancer incidence in this geographical comparisonto show a relationship at the individual level between diet and cancer risk in a prospective study would require detailed and accurate methods for the assessment of nsp consumption
