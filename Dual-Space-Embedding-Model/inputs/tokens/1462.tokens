inositol hexaphosphate ip6 a naturally polyphosphorylated carbohydrate has been reported to have significant in vivo and in vitro anticancer activity against numerous tumours such as colon prostate breast liver and rhabdomyosarcomasto confirm this activity in haematological malignancies and to characterize some of the mechanisms of ip6 action we analysed its effects on human leukaemic cell lines and fresh chronic myelogenous leukaemia cml progenitor cells using a combined cellular and molecular approachip6 had a dosedependent cytotoxic effect on all of the evaluated cell lines with accumulation in the g2m phase in two out of five cell lines testedat the molecular level cdna microarray analysis after ip6 exposure showed an extensive downmodulation of genes involved in transcription and cell cycle regulation and a coherent upregulation of cell cycle inhibitorsfurthermore ip6 treatment of fresh leukaemic samples of bone marrow cd34 cml progenitor cells significantly inhibited granulocytemacrophage colonyforming unit cfugm formation p  00062 in comparison to normal bone marrow specimens which were not affectedno differentiating effect on hl60 cells was observedtaken together our results confirm the antiproliferative activity of ip6 and suggest that it may have a specific antitumour effect also in chronic myeloid leukaemias via active gene modulation
