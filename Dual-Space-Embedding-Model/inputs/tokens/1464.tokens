inositol hexaphosphate ip6 is a naturally occurring polyphosphorylated carbohydrate that is present in substantial amounts in almost all plant and mammalian cellsit was recently recognized to possess multiple biological functionsa striking anticancer effect of ip6 was demonstrated in different experimental modelsinositol is also a natural constituent possessing moderate anticancer activitythe most consistent and best anticancer results were obtained from the combination of ip6 plus inositolin addition to reducing cell proliferation ip6 increases differentiation of malignant cells often resulting in a reversion to normal phenotypeexogenously administered ip6 is rapidly taken into the cells and dephosphorylated to lowerphosphate inositol phosphates which further interfere with signal transduction pathways and cell cycle arrestenhanced immunity and antioxidant properties can also contribute to tumor cell destructionhowever the molecular mechanisms underlying this anticancer action are not fully understoodbecause it is abundantly present in regular diet efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and safe ip6 holds great promise in our strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancerip6 plus inositol enhances the anticancer effect of conventional chemotherapy controls cancer metastases and improves the quality of life as shown in a pilot clinical trialthe data strongly argue for the use of ip6 plus inositol in our strategies for cancer prevention and treatmenthowever the effectiveness and safety of ip6 plus inositol at therapeutic doses needs to be determined in phase i and phase ii clinical trials in humans
