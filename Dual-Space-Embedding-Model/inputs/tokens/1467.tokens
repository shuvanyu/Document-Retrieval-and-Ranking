objective lowcarbohydrate diets and their combination with highprotein diets have been gaining widespread popularity to control weightin addition to weight loss they may have favorable shortterm effects on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease cvdour objective was to elucidate their longterm effects on mortality and cvd incidencedata sources medline embase isi web of science cochrane library and clinicaltrialsgov for relevant articles published as of september 2012cohort studies of at least one years followup period were includedreview methods identified articles were systematically reviewed and those with pertinent data were selected for metaanalysispooled risk ratios rrs with 95 confidence intervals cis for allcause mortality cvd mortality and cvd incidence were calculated using the randomeffects model with inversevariance weightingresults we included 17 studies for a systematic review followed by a metaanalysis using pertinent dataof the 272216 people in 4 cohort studies using the lowcarbohydrate score 15981 59 cases of death from allcause were reportedthe risk of allcause mortality among those with high lowcarbohydrate score was significantly elevated the pooled rr 95 ci was 131 107159a total of 3214 13 cases of cvd death among 249272 subjects in 3 cohort studies and 5081 23 incident cvd cases among 220691 people in different 4 cohort studies were reportedthe risks of cvd mortality and incidence were not statistically increased the pooled rrs 95 cis were 110 098124 and 098 078124 respectivelyanalyses using lowcarbohydratehighprotein score yielded similar resultsconclusion lowcarbohydrate diets were associated with a significantly higher risk of allcause mortality and they were not significantly associated with a risk of cvd mortality and incidencehowever this analysis is based on limited observational studies and largescale trials on the complex interactions between lowcarbohydrate diets and longterm outcomes are needed
