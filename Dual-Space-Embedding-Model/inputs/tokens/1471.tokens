background studies have shown that pistachios can improve blood lipid profiles in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia which could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseasehowever there is also a widely perceived view that eating nuts can lead to body weight gain due to their high fat contentpurpose to investigate the impact of different dosages of pistachios on body weight blood pressure blood lipids blood glucose and insulin in subjects with metabolic syndromemethods ninety subjects with metabolic syndrome consistent with 2005 international diabetes federation metabolic syndrome standard without diabetes were enrolled in three endocrinology outpatient clinics in beijingall subjects received dietary counseling according to the guidelines of the american heart association step i dietafter a 4 week runin subjects were randomized to consume either the recommended daily serving of 42 g pistachios rsg a higher daily serving of 70 g pistachio hsg or no pistachios dcg for 12 weeksresults subjects in all three groups were matched at baseline for bmi dcg 2803  43 rsg 2812  322 and hsg 2801  451 kgm2there were no significant changes in body weight or bmi in any groups during the study nor any change from baseline at any time point in any groupduring the entire study there were no significant differences in waisttohip ratio among the groups or any change from baseline in any group dcg 000  003 rsg 001  002 and hsg 001  004there were no significant differences detected among groups in triglycerides fasting glucose and 2 hour postprandial glucose following a 75 gram glucose challengeexploratory analyses demonstrated that glucose values 2 h after a 75 gm glucose challenge were significantly lower at week 12 compared with baseline values in the hsg group 113  258 mmoll p  002 and a similar trend was noted in the rsg group 077  207 mmoll p  006 while no significant change was seen in the dcg group 015  227 mmoll p  0530at the end of study serum triglyceride levels were significantly lower compared with baseline in the rsg group 038  079 mmoll p  0018 but no significant changes were observed in the hsg or dcg groupsconclusion despite concerns that pistachio nut consumption may promote weight gain the daily ingestion of either 42 g or 70 g of pistachios for 12 weeks did not lead to weight gain or an increase in waisttohip ratio in chinese subjects with metabolic syndromein addition pistachio consumption may improve the risk factor associated with the metabolic syndrome
