background epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse association between the frequency of nut consumption and body mass index bmi and risk of obesityhowever clinical trials that evaluated nut consumption on adiposity have been scarce and inconclusiveobjective we performed a systematic review and metaanalysis of published randomized nutfeeding trials to estimate the effect of nut consumption on adiposity measuresdesign medline and the cochrane central register of controlled trials databases were searched for relevant clinical trials of nut intake that provided outcomes of body weight bmi in kgm2 or waistcircumference measures and were published before december 2012there were no language restrictionstwo investigators independently selected and reviewed eligible studiesthe weighted mean difference wmd between nut or control diets was estimated by using a randomeffects metaanalysis with 95 cisresults thirtythree clinical trials met our inclusion criteriapooled results indicated a nonsignificant effect on body weight wmd 047 kg 95 ci 117 022 kg i2  7 bmi wmd 040 kgm2 95 ci 097 017 kgm2 i2  49 or waist circumference wmd 125 cm 95 ci 282 031 cm i2  28 of diets including nuts compared with control dietsthese findings were remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysisno publication bias was shownconclusion compared with control diets diets enriched with nuts did not increase body weight body mass index or waist circumference in controlled clinical trials
