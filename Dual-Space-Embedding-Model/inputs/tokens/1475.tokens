background increased nut consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of major chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitushowever the association between nut consumption and mortality remains unclearmethods we examined the association between nut consumption and subsequent total and causespecific mortality among 76464 women in the nurses health study 19802010 and 42498 men in the health professionals followup study 19862010participants with a history of cancer heart disease or stroke were excludednut consumption was assessed at baseline and updated every 2 to 4 yearsresults during 3038853 personyears of followup 16200 women and 11229 men diednut consumption was inversely associated with total mortality among both women and men after adjustment for other known or suspected risk factorsthe pooled multivariate hazard ratios for death among participants who ate nuts as compared with those who did not were 093 95 confidence interval ci 090 to 096 for the consumption of nuts less than once per week 089 95 ci 086 to 093 for once per week 087 95 ci 083 to 090 for two to four times per week 085 95 ci 079 to 091 for five or six times per week and 080 95 ci 073 to 086 for seven or more times per week p0001 for trendsignificant inverse associations were also observed between nut consumption and deaths due to cancer heart disease and respiratory diseaseconclusions in two large independent cohorts of nurses and other health professionals the frequency of nut consumption was inversely associated with total and causespecific mortality independently of other predictors of deathfunded by the national institutes of health and the international tree nut council nutrition research and education foundation
