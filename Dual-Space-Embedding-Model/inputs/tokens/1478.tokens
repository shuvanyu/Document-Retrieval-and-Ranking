curcumin exhibits antiinflammatory and antitumor activitiesalthough its functional mechanism has not been elucidated so far numerous studies have shown that curcumin induces apoptosis in cancer cellsin the present study we show that subtoxic concentrations of curcumin sensitize human renal cancer cells to the tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis inducing ligand trailmediated apoptosisthis apoptosis induced by the combination of curcumin and trail is not interrupted by bcl2 overexpressionwe found that treatment with curcumin significantly induces death receptor 5 dr5 expression both at its mrna and protein levels accompanying the generation of the reactive oxygen species rosnot only the pretreatment with nacetylcystine but also the ectopic expression of peroxiredoxin ii an antioxidative protein dramatically inhibited the apoptosis induced by curcumin and trail in combination blocking the curcuminmediated dr5 upregulationtaken together the present study demonstrates that curcumin enhances trailinduced apoptosis by rosmediated dr5 upregulation
