it has been reported that curcumin inhibited various types of cancer cells in vitro and in vivohowever mechanisms of curcumininhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in human nonsmall cell lung cancer cells ncih460 still remain unclearin this study ncih460 cells were treated with curcumin to determine its anticancer activitydifferent concentrations of curcumin were used for different durations in ncih460 cells and the subsequent changes in the cell morphology viability cell cycle mrna and protein expressions were determinedcurcumin induced apoptotic morphologic changes in ncih460 cells in a dosedependent mannerafter curcumin treatment bax and bad were upregulated bcl2 bclxl and xiap were downregulatedin addition reactive oxygen species ros intracellular ca2 and endoplasmic reticulum er stress were increased in ncih460 cells after exposure to curcuminthese signals led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential delta psim and culminated in caspase3 activationcurcumininduced apoptosis was also stimulated through the fascaspase8 extrinsic pathway and er stress proteins growth arrest and dna damageinducible gene 153 gadd153 and glucoseregulated protein 78 grp78 were activated in the ncih460 cellsapoptotic cell death induced by curcumin was significantly reversed by pretreatment with ros scavenger or caspase8 inhibitorfurthermore the ncih460 cells tended to be arrested at the g2m cell cycle stage after curcumin treatment and downregulation of cyclindependent kinase 1 cdk1 may be involvedin summary curcumin exerts its anticancer effects on lung cancer ncih460 cells through apoptosis or cell cycle arrest
