this study evaluated the toxicological sensitivity of nonfeeding larval stages of a key antarctic species antarctic krill euphausia superba to ppdichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene ppdde exposurethe aqueous uptake clearance rate of 84 ml g1 preserved weight pwh1 determined for ppdde in antarctic krill larvae is comparable to previous findings for small cold water crustaceans and five times slower than the rates reported for an amphipod inhabiting warmer watersnatural variations in larval physiology appear to influence contaminant uptake and larval krill behavioural responses strongly highlighting the importance of time of measurement for ecotoxicological testingsublethal narcosis immobility was observed in larval antarctic krill from ppdde body residues of 02 mmolkg pw which is in agreement with findings for adult krill and temperate aquatic speciesthe finding of comparable body residuebased toxicity of ppdde between polar and temperate species supports the tissue residue approach for environmental risk assessment of polar ecosystemscopyright Ã¢ 2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
