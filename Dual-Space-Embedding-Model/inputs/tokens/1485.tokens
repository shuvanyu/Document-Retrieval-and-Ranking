numerous natural compounds have been extensively investigated for their potential for cancer prevention over decadescurcumin from curcuma longa is a highly promising natural compound that can be potentially used for chemoprevention of multiple cancerscurcumin modulates multiple molecular pathways involved in the lengthy carcinogenesis process to exert its chemopreventive effects through several mechanisms promoting apoptosis inhibiting survival signals scavenging reactive oxidative species ros and reducing the inflammatory cancer microenvironmentcurcumin fulfills the characteristics for an ideal chemopreventive agent with its low toxicity affordability and easy accessibilitynevertheless the clinical application of curcumin is currently compromised by its poor bioavailabilityhere we review the potential of curcumin in cancer prevention its molecular targets and action mechanismsfinally we suggest specific recommendations to improve its efficacy and bioavailability for clinical applications
