because of recent studies indicating possible embryolethality and teratogenicity of fdc red no2 and ad hoc committee was convened by the food and drug administration to consider these questionsthe committee suggested a collaborative study by three laboratories food and drug administration fda industrial biotest laboratories ibt and national center for toxicological research nctr in which red no2 was given at 200 mgkg body weight by gavage during days 019 615 or 79 of gestationfdc red no2 was also given at the same dose level via water bottleappropriate controls were utilizedfda used osbornemendel strain rats ibt used charles river and nctr used both strainsno significant increases in skeletal or visceral abnormalities were seenno significant increase in resorptions was seen in the osbornemendel strain but the charles river strain at ibt showed a significant increase in litters with two or more resorptions after dams had been given 200 mgkg at 019 days of gestationthe nctr study on the charles river strain also showed an increase in the same parameter for the same dose level and in addition showed a significant increase in the percentage of resorptions per litterit was concluded that because of the inherent variation and the absence of an increase in abnormalities or other indications of embryotoxicity there is reason to doubt that this effect is either biologically significant or reproducible
