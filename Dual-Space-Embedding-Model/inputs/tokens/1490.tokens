erythrosine erb is a xanthene and an us food and drug administration approved dye used in foods drugs and cosmeticsalthough its utilization is permitted erb is described as inhibitor of enzymes and proteinprotein interactions and is toxic to pituitary and spermatogenesis processeshowever the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of erb is inconclusive in the literaturethis study aimed to analyze the genotoxicity of this dye using the alkaline comet assay and is the first investigation to evaluate erb mutagenicity using the cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome cbmncyt assay in hepg2 cellsthese cells were chosen because they produce phase i and phase ii enzymes that can mimic in vivo metabolismthe cells were treated with seven concentrations 01700 Î¼g ml1 of erb and the results showed genotoxicity at the two highest concentrations and mutagenicity at six concentrationsfurthermore as micronuclei result from clastogenic and aneugenic processes while comet assay is often considered more sensitive and detects dna single strain breaks we suggest that an aneugenic is responsible for the observed damagealthough erb is approved for use in the food cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries it must be used carefully because it damages the dna structurecopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
