the exposure to some chemicals can lead to hormone disrupting effectspresently much attention is focused on socalled xenoestrogens synthetic compounds that interact with hormone receptors causing a number of reactions that eventually lead to effects related to reproduction and developmentthe current study was initiated to investigate the presence of a number of such compounds in precipitation as a followup on a previous study in which pesticide concentrations in air and precipitation were determinedrainwater samples were collected at about 50 locations in the netherlands in a four week periodthe samples were analysed for bisphenola alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates phthalates flame retardants and synthetic musk compoundsthe results clearly indicated the presence of these compounds in precipitationthe concentrations ranged from the low ng l1 range for flame retardants to several thousands of ng l1 for the phthalatesbisphenola was found in 30 of the samples in concentrations up to 130 ng l1 while alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates were found in virtually all locations in concentrations up to 920 ng l1 for the individual compoundsphthalates were by far the most abundant xenoestrogens in the precipitation samples and were found in every samplediisodecyl phthalate was found in a surprisingly high concentration of almost 100 000 ng l1polybrominated flame retardants were found in the low ng l1 range and generally in less than 20 of the samplesnoticeable was the finding of hexabromocyclododecane a replacement for the polybrominted diphenyl ethers at one location in a concentration of almost 2000 ng l1finally as expected synthetic musk compounds were detected in almost all samplesthis is especially true for the polycyclic musks hhcb and ahtnnitro musks were found but only on a few locationskriging techniques were used to calculate precipitation concentrations in between actual sampling locations to produce contour plots for a number of compoundsthese plots clearly show located emission sources for a number of compounds such as bisphenola nonylphenol ethoxylate phthalates and ahtnon the contrary the results for hhcb and some phthalates indicated diffuse emission patterns probably as the result of the use of consumer products containing these compounds
