background the contribution of ascorbate to urinary oxalate is controversialthe present study aimed to determine whether urinary oxalate and ph may be affected by vitamin c supplementation in calcium stoneforming patientsmethods fortyseven adult calcium stoneforming patients received either 1 g n23 or 2 g n24 of vitamin c supplement for 3 days and 20 healthy subjects received 1 g a 24hour urine sample was obtained both before and after vitamin c for calcium oxalate magnesium citrate sodium potassium and creatinine determinationthe tiselius index was used as a calcium oxalate crystallization indexa spot fasting morning urine sample was also obtained to determine the urinary ph before and after vitamin c results fasting urinary ph did not change after 1 g 58  06 vs 58  07 or 2 g vitamin c 58  08 vs 58  07a significant increase in mean urinary oxalate was observed in calcium stoneforming patients receiving either 1 g 50  16 vs 31  12 mg24 hours or 2 g 48  21 vs 34  12 mg24 hours of vitamin c and in healthy subjects 25  12 vs 39  13 mg24 hoursa significant increase in mean tiselius index was observed in calcium stoneforming patients after 1 g 143  070 vs 092  065 or 2 g vitamin c 161  105 vs 099  055 and in healthy subjects 150  069 vs 091  046ancillary analyses of spot urine obtained after vitamin c were performed in 15 control subjects in vessels with or without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta with no difference in urinary oxalate between them 28  23 vs 26  21 mgl suggesting that the in vitro conversion of ascorbate to oxalate did not occurconclusion these data suggest that vitamin c supplementation may increase urinary oxalate excretion and the risk of calcium oxalate crystallization in calcium stoneforming patients
