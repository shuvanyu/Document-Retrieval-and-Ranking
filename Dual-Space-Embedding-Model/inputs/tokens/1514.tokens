ample research indicates that agerelated neuronalbehavioral decrements are the result of oxidative stress that may be ameliorated by antioxidantsour previous study had shown that rats given dietary supplements of fruit and vegetable extracts with high antioxidant activity for 8 months beginning at 6 months of age retarded agerelated declines in neuronal and cognitive functionthe present study showed that such supplements strawberry spinach or blueberry at 148 91 or 186 gm of dried aqueous extract per kilogram of diet respectively fed for 8 weeks to 19monthold fischer 344 rats were also effective in reversing agerelated deficits in several neuronal and behavioral parameters including oxotremorine enhancement of kevoked release of dopamine from striatal slices carbacholstimulated gtpase activity striatal ca45 buffering in striatal synaptosomes motor behavioral performance on the rod walking and accelerod tasks and morris water maze performancethese findings suggest that in addition to their known beneficial effects on cancer and heart disease phytochemicals present in antioxidantrich foods may be beneficial in reversing the course of neuronal and behavioral aging
