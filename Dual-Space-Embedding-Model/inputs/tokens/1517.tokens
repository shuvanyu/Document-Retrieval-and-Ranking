as the population of people in the united states over the age of 65 years continues to increase so too will the incidence of agerelated pathologies including decreases in cognitive and motor functionin cases of severe deficits in memory or motor function hospitalization andor custodial care would be a likely outcomethis means that unless some way is found to reduce these agerelated decrements in neuronal function health care costs will continue to rise exponentiallyevidence is accumulating that consumption of blueberries may be one strategy to forestall or even reverse agerelated neuronal deficits as well as their subsequent behavioral manifestations in order to increase healthy agingresearch suggests that the polyphenolic compounds found in blueberries exert their beneficial effects either through their ability to lower oxidative stress and inflammation or directly by altering the signaling involved in neuronal communicationthese interventions in turn may protect against agerelated deficits in cognitive and motor functionappropriately the us department of agriculture has figured prominently in these discoveries through the efforts of two usda researchers who worked for the department 100 years apartcopyright  2012 s karger ag basel
