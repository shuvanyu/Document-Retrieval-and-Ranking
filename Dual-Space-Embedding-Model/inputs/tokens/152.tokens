a heat stable toxin present in needles of ponderosa pine was found to be soluble in methanol ethanol chloroform hexanes and 1butanolthe embryotoxic effects of fresh green pine needles and a chloroformmethanol extract were determined by measuring embryo resorption in pregnant miceautoclaving the needles and extract for 1 hour prior to feeding enhanced the embryoresorptive effect by 28 and 32 respectivelythe results of this study revealed that the embryo resorptive dose erd50 of heat stable toxin for 1 mouse was 895 gmsfor fresh green pine needles and 646 gmsfor autoclaved green pine needlesin addition to embryocidal effects feeding of the toxin resulted in significant weight loss in adult mice
