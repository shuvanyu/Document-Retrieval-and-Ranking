the process of malignant transformation universally entails genetic damage and oncogenic signaling two stresses that are signaled to p53 through different genetic pathwaysbased on this it is possible to distinguish two jobs for p53 guardian of the genome that consists in sensing and reacting to dna damage through the atmatr and chk1chk2 kinases and policeman of the oncogenes that correspondingly consists in responding to oncogenic signaling through the p53stabilizing protein arfcontrary to expectation recent genetic evidence in mice indicates that the response of p53 to dna damage has little or no impact on cancer protectionin contrast arfdependent activation of p53 is critical for p53mediated tumor suppressionhere we discuss the mechanistic implications of these observations and their relevance for cancer therapy
