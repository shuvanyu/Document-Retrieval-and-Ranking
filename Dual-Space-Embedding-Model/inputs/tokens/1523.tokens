smokehouse smoke which is used for flavouring meat products was investigated for its mutagenic activity in the salmonella typhimurium assaywe were chiefly concerned with the fractions free of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but containing phenol compounds which are responsible for the preservative and aromatizing properties of the smokethe most abundantly occurring phenol compounds phenol cresols 24dimethylphenol brenzcatechine syringol eugenol vanilline and guaiacol gave negative results when they were tested for mutagenicity at five concentrations up to 5000 microgramsplate with and without s9 mix using five strains of s typhimuriumeven when phenol was further investigated in a variety of test conditions no induction of his revertants was observedwhen smokehouse smoke was condensed and fractionated the majority of the various phenolic fractions also gave negative results when tested at five concentrations using five strains of s typhimuriumhowever there was a slight increase in the number of revertants in a few casesthe presence in the phenolic fractions of very small amounts of mutagenic impurities the nature of which needs further investigation cannot be excludedthese results support the further development of nonhazardous smokearoma preparations based on the phenolic components of smokehouse smoke
