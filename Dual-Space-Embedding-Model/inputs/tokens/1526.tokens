commercial aqueous woodsmoke flavouring induced significant increases in the 6thioguanine resistance mutation frequency of tk6 human lymphoblasts at 01 microliter flavouringml of cell suspensionthis corresponds to 6 microgramsml of dissolved solids as determined by fully drying the aqueous flavouring in a vacuum desiccatorin ahh1 human lymphoblasts which contain a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase system mutations were induced at 03 microliterml corresponding to 18 microlitersml of dissolved solidsthe flavouring did not induce 8azaguanine resistant mutations in salmonella typhimurium at concentrations up to 15 microlitermlat higher concentrations the flavouring was toxic to bacteriathe flavouring did not induce lung adenomas or other tumours in newborn mice when injected ip with total doses of up to 26 microliters over a 3wk periodtoxicity to the kidney colon and rectum was observed in some mice at 15 wk of age
