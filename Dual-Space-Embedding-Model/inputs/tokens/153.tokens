many products used in everyday life are made with the assistance of nanotechnologiescosmetic pharmaceuticals sunscreen powdered food are only few examples of end products containing nanosized particles nps generally added to improve the product qualityto evaluate correctly benefits vs risks of engineered nanomaterials and consequently to legislate in favor of consumers protection it is necessary to know the hazards connected with the exposure levelsthis information implies transversal studies and a number of different competenceson analytical point of view the identification quantification and characterization of nps in food matrices and in cosmetic or personal care products pose significant challenges because nps are usually present at low concentration levels and the matrices in which they are dispersed are complexes and often incompatible with analytical instruments that would be required for their detection and characterizationthis paper focused on some analytical techniques suitable for the detection characterization and quantification of nps in food and cosmetics products reports their recent application in characterizing specific metal and metaloxide nps in these two important industrial and market sectorsthe need of a characterization of the nps as much as possible complete matching complementary information about different metrics possible achieved through validate procedures is what clearly emerges from this researchmore work should be done to produce standardized materials and to setup methodologies to determine numberbased size distributions and to get quantitative date about the nps in such a complex matrices
