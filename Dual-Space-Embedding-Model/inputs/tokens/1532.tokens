background and purpose consumption of antioxidantrich foods may reduce the risk of stroke by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammationtotal antioxidant capacity tac takes into account all antioxidants and the synergistic effects between themwe examined the association between dietary tac and stroke incidence in cardiovascular disease cvdfree women and in women with cvd history at baselinemethods the study included women 31035 cvdfree and 5680 with cvd history at baseline aged 49 to 83 years from the swedish mammography cohortdiet was assessed with a food frequency questionnairedietary tac was calculated using oxygen radical absorbance capacity valuesstroke cases were ascertained by linkage with the swedish hospital discharge registryresults during followup september 1997 to december 2009 we identified 1322 stroke cases 988 cerebral infarctions 226 hemorrhagic strokes and 108 unspecified strokes among cvdfree women and 1007 stroke cases 796 cerebral infarctions 100 hemorrhagic strokes and 111 unspecified strokes among women with a cvd historythe multivariable hazard ratio of total stroke comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of dietary tac was 083 95 ci 070099 p for trend004 in cvdfree womenamong women with a cvd history the hazard ratios for the highest versus lowest quartile of tac were 090 95 ci 075107 p for trend030 for total stroke and 055 95 ci 032095 p for trend003 for hemorrhagic strokeconclusions these findings suggest that dietary tac is inversely associated with total stroke among cvdfree women and hemorrhagic stroke among women with cvd history
