significance the free radical theory of aging has provided a theoretical framework for an enormous amount of work leading to significant advances in our understanding of agingup to the turn of the century the theory received abundant support from observations coming from fields as far apart as comparative physiology or molecular biologyrecent advances work from many laboratories supports the theory for instance showing that overexpression of antioxidant enzymes results in increases in lifespanbut other labs have shown that in some cases there is an increased oxidative stress and increased longevitythe discovery that free radicals can not only cause molecular damage to cells but also serve as signals led to the proposal that they act as modulators of physiological processesfor instance reactive oxygen species ros stimulate physiological adaptations to physical exercisecritical issues a critical blow to the free radical theory of aging came from epidemiological studies showing that antioxidant supplementation did not lower the incidence of many ageassociated diseases but in some cases increased the risk of deathmoreover recent molecular evidence has shown that increasing generation of ros in some cases increases longevityfuture directions gerontologists interested in free radical biology are at a crossroads and clearly new insights are required to clarify the role of ros in the process of agingthe hurdles are no doubt very high but the intellectual and practical promise of these studies is of such magnitude that we feel that all efforts will be generously rewardingantioxidredox signal19 779787
