extensive experimental data have revealed a central role for oxidative stress in atherogenesis and suggested a potential role for antioxidant treatment in cardiovascular disease cvd 111experimental data however have not translated into clinical benefit most antioxidant vitamin trials have failed to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 12moreover recent clinical trials have suggested that monotherapy with certain antioxidant vitamins like vitamin e may in fact be detrimental 13as a result of the disappointing outcome of antioxidant vitamin trials some authors have questioned both the utility of antioxidant treatment in cvd and the supposedly central role of oxidative stress in atherogenesis 1419other investigators however sustain that the beneficial effects of lipid lowering and antihypertensive treatment are at least in part due to their antioxidant properties in addition to their specific pharmacological properties 20 21oxidant stress plays a pivotal role in atherogenesis however the clinical promise of antioxidant vitamins has failed to translate into clinical benefitincreasing evidence suggests that more rigorous clinical trial designs are necessary to effectively divulge antioxidant utility and that a multifaceted antioxidant approach to atherosclerosis may yield the most clinical rewardthis article reviews currently available evidence on the role of oxidant stress in atherosclerosis analyzes the results of large antioxidant trials and suggests ways to investigate the true role of antioxidant treatment in the clinical setting
