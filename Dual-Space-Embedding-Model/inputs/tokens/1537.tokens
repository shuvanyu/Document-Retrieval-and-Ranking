lipid peroxidation is in most instances a free radical chain reaction that can be described in terms of initiation propagation branching and termination processeswith regard to lipid peroxidation one of the most important questions concerns the source of the primary catalysts that initiate peroxidation in situ in muscle foodswhen cells are injured such as in muscle foods after slaughtering lipid peroxidation is favored and traces of o2 and h2o2 indicating lipid peroxides are formedthe stability of a muscle food product will depend on the tone of these peroxides and especially from the involvement of metal ions in the processthe cytosol contains not only prooxidants but also antioxidants and the tone of both affects the overall oxidationlipid peroxidation is one of the primary mechanisms of quality deterioration in foods and especially in meat productsthe changes in quality can be manifested by deterioration in flavor color texture nutritive value and the production of toxic compoundscopyright  1993published by elsevier ltd
