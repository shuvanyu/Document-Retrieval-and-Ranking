atherosclerosis may result partly from processes that occur following food consumption and that involve oxidized lipids in chylomicronswe investigated reactions that could occur in the acidic ph of the stomach and accelerate the generation of lipid hydroperoxides and cooxidation of dietary constituentsthe ability of dietary polyphenols to invert catalysis from prooxidation to antioxidation was examinedthe acidic ph of gastric fluid amplified lipid peroxidation catalyzed by metmyoglobin or iron ionsmetmyoglobin catalyzed peroxidation of edible oil resulting in 8fold increase of hydroperoxide concentrationthe incubation of heated muscle tissue in simulated gastric fluid for 2 h enhanced hydroperoxides accumulation by 6fold to 1200 micromin the presence of catechin or red wine polyphenols metmyoglobin catalyzed the breakdown of hydroperoxides to zero totally preventing lipid peroxidation and betacarotene cooxidationwe suggest that human gastric fluid may be an excellent medium for enhancing the oxidation of lipids and other dietary constituentsthe results indicate the potentially harmful effects of oxidized fats intake in the presence of endogenous catalysts found in foods and the major benefit of including in the meal plant dietary antioxidants
