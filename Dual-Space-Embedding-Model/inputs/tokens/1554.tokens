background the major drivers of the obesity epidemic are much debated and have considerable policy importance for the populationwide prevention of obesityobjective the objective was to determine the relative contributions of increased energy intake and reduced physical activity to the us obesity epidemicdesign we predicted the changes in weight from the changes in estimated energy intakes in us children and adults between the 1970s and 2000sthe increased us food energy supply adjusted for wastage and assumed to be proportional to energy intake was apportioned to children and adults and inserted into equations that relate energy intake to body weight derived from doubly labeled water studiesthe weight increases predicted from the equations were compared with weight increases measured in representative us surveys over the same periodresults for children the measured weight gain was 40 kg and the predicted weight gain for the increased energy intake was identical at 40 kgfor adults the measured weight gain was 86 kg whereas the predicted weight gain was somewhat higher 108 kgconclusions increased energy intake appears to be more than sufficient to explain weight gain in the us populationa reversal of the increase in energy intake of approximately 2000 kjd 500 kcald for adults and of 1500 kjd 350 kcald for children would be needed for a reversal to the mean body weights of the 1970salternatively large compensatory increases in physical activity eg 110150 min of walkingd or a combination of both would achieve the same outcomepopulation approaches to reducing obesity should emphasize a reduction in the drivers of increased energy intake
