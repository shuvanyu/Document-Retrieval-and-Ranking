overcrowding stress is a reality in the poultry industrychickens exposed to longterm stressful situations present a reduction of welfare and immunosuppressionwe designed this experiment to analyse the effects from overcrowding stress of 16 birdsm2 on performance parameters serum corticosterone levels the relative weight of the bursa of fabricius plasma iga and igg levels intestinal integrity macrophage activity and experimental salmonella enteritidis invasionthe results of this study indicate that overcrowding stress decreased performance parameters induced enteritis and decreased macrophage activity and the relative bursa weight in broiler chickenswhen the chickens were similarly stressed and infected with salmonella enteritidis there was an increase in feed conversion and a decrease in plasma igg levels in the stressed and salmonellainfected birdswe observed moderate enteritis throughout the duodenum of chickens stressed and infected with salmonellathe overcrowding stress decreased the macrophage phagocytosis intensity and increased salmonella enteritidis counts in the livers of birds challenged with the pathogenic bacteriumovercrowding stress via the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis that is associated with an increase in corticosterone and enteritis might influence the quality of the intestinal immune barrier and the integrity of the small intestinethis effect allowed pathogenic bacteria to migrate through the intestinal mucosa resulting in inflammatory infiltration and decreased nutrient absorptionthe data strengthen the hypothesis that control of the welfare of chickens and avoidance of stress from overcrowding in poultry production are relevant factors for the maintenance of intestinal integrity performance and decreased susceptibility to salmonella infection
