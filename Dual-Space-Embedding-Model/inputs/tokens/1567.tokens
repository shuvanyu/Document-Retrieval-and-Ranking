the current study was undertaken to acquire data on contamination of chicken parts with salmonella at retail and to acquire data on crosscontamination of cooked chicken with salmonella from raw chicken during meal preparationwhole raw chickens n  31 were obtained from local retail stores and cut into two wings two breasts without skin or bones two thighs and two drumsticksdata for crosscontamination were obtained by cutting up a sterile cooked chicken breast with the same board and knife used to cut up the raw chickenthe board knife and latex gloves used by the food handler were not rinsed or washed before cutting up the sterile cooked chicken breast thus providing a worstcase scenario for crosscontaminationstandard curves for the concentration of salmonella bacteria in 400 ml of buffered peptone water after 6 h of incubation of chicken parts as a function of the initial log number of salmonella bacteria inoculated onto chicken parts were developed and used to enumerate salmonella bacteriastandard curves were not affected by the type of chicken part but did differ p  005 among the five isolates of salmonella examinedconsequently salmonella bacteria were enumerated on naturally contaminated chicken parts using a standard curve developed with the serotype of salmonella that was isolated from the original samplethe prevalence of contamination was 3  4 of 132 whereas the incidence of crosscontamination was 18  1 of 57the positive chicken parts were a thigh from chicken 4 which contained 3 cfu of salmonella enterica serotype kentucky and both wings one thigh and one cooked breast portion from chicken 15 which all contained 1 cfu of serotype 820z6these results indicated that the poultry industry is providing consumers in the studied area with chicken that has a low prevalence and low number of salmonella bacteria at retail and that has a low incidence and low level of crosscontamination of cooked chicken with salmonella from raw chicken during meal preparation under a worstcase scenario
