context considerable controversy exists regarding the association of omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas and major cardiovascular end pointsobjective to assess the role of omega3 supplementation on major cardiovascular outcomesdata sources medline embase and the cochrane central register of controlled trials through august 2012study selection randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of omega3 on allcause mortality cardiac death sudden death myocardial infarction and strokedata extraction descriptive and quantitative information was extracted absolute and relative risk rr estimates were synthesized under a randomeffects modelheterogeneity was assessed using the q statistic and i2subgroup analyses were performed for the presence of blinding the prevention settings and patients with implantable cardioverterdefibrillators and metaregression analyses were performed for the omega3 dosea statistical significance threshold of 0063 was assumed after adjustment for multiple comparisonsdata synthesis of the 3635 citations retrieved 20 studies of 68680 patients were included reporting 7044 deaths 3993 cardiac deaths 1150 sudden deaths 1837 myocardial infarctions and 1490 strokesno statistically significant association was observed with allcause mortality rr 096 95 ci 091 to 102 risk reduction rd 0004 95 ci 001 to 002 cardiac death rr 091 95 ci 085 to 098 rd 001 95 ci 002 to 000 sudden death rr 087 95 ci 075 to 101 rd 0003 95 ci 0012 to 0006 myocardial infarction rr 089 95 ci 076 to 104 rd 0002 95 ci 0007 to 0002 and stroke rr 105 95 ci 093 to 118 rd 0001 95 ci 0002 to 0004 when all supplement studies were consideredconclusion overall omega3 pufa supplementation was not associated with a lower risk of allcause mortality cardiac death sudden death myocardial infarction or stroke based on relative and absolute measures of association
