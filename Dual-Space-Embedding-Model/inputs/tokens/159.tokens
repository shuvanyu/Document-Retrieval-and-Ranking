background the association between consumption of multivitamins and breast cancer is inconsistent in epidemiologic studiesobjective to perform a metaanalysis of cohort and casecontrol studies to evaluate multivitamin intake and its relationship with breast cancer riskmethods the published literature was systematically searched and reviewed using medline 1950 through july 2010 embase 1980 through july 2010 and the cochrane central register of controlled trials the cochrane library 2010 issue 1studies that included specific risk estimates were pooled using a randomeffects modelthe bias and quality of these studies were assessed with revman statistical software version 50 and the grade method of the cochrane collaborationresults eight of 27 studies that included 355080 subjects were available for analysisthe total duration of multivitamin use in these trials ranged from 3 to 10 yearsthe frequency of current use in these studies ranged from 2 to 6 timesweekin analyses by duration of use 10 years or longer or 3 years or longer and by frequency 7 or more timesweek that were reported in these studies multivitamin use was not significantly associated with the risk of breast canceronly 1 recent swedish cohort study concluded that multivitamin use is associated with an increased risk of breast cancerthe results of a metaanalysis that pooled data from 5 cohort studies and 3 casecontrol studies indicated that the overall multivariable relative risk and odds ratio were 010 95 ci 060 to 163 p  098 and 100 95 ci 051 to 100 p  100 respectivelythe association was not statistically significantconclusions multivitamin use is likely not associated with a significant increased or decreased risk of breast cancer but these results highlight the need for more casecontrol studies or randomized controlled clinical trials to further examine this relationship
