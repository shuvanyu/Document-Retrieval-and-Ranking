curcumin is extensively used as a spice and pigment and has anticarcinogenic effects that could be linked to its antioxidant propertieshowever some studies suggest that this natural compound possesses both pro and antioxidative effectsin this study we found that curcumin induced dna damage to both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in human hepatoma g2 cellsusing quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry staining of 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine we demonstrated that curcumin induced dosedependent damage in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes and that the mitochondrial damage was more extensivenuclear dna fragments were also evident in comet assaysthe mechanism underlies the elevated level of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation generated by curcuminthe lack of dna damage at low doses suggested that low levels of curcumin does not induce dna damage and may play an antioxidant role in carcinogenesisbut at high doses we found that curcumin imposed oxidative stress and damaged dnathese data reinforce the hypothesis that curcumin plays a conflicting dual role in carcinogenesisalso the extensive mitochondrial dna damage might be an initial event triggering curcumininduced cell death
