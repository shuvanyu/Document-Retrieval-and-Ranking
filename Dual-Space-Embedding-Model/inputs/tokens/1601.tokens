background the extract of medicinal plants containing curcumin is traditionally believed to have a positive contraction effect on the human gallbladderaims to compare the effect of 20 mg curcumin or placebo on the gallbladder volume of healthy volunteersmethods a randomized double blind and crossover design study was carried out in 12 healthy volunteers seven males and five femalesultrasonography examination was carried out serially to measure the gallbladder volumethe data obtained was analysed by paired students ttestresults the fasting gallbladder volumes of 1574  429 ml on curcumin and 1598  408 ml on placebo were similar p  020the gallbladder volume was reduced within the period after curcumin administrationthe percentage of gallbladder volume reduction at 05 10 15 and 20 h after 20 mg curcumin administration were 118  69 168  74 220  85 and 293  83 respectively which was statistically significant compared to placeboconclusion on the basis of the present findings it appears that curcumin induces contraction of the human gallbladder
