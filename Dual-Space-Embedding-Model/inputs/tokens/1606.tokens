piperine a major active component of black and long peppers has been reported to enhance drug bioavailabilitythe present studies were aimed at understanding the interaction of piperine with enzymatic drug biotransforming reactions in hepatic tissue in vitro and in vivopiperine inhibited arylhydrocarbon hydroxylation ethylmorphinendemethylation 7ethoxycoumarinodeethylation and 3hydroxybenzoapyrene glucuronidation in rat postmitochondrial supernatant in vitro in a dosedependent mannerpiperine inhibition of these reactions in postmitochondrial supernatant from 3methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitaltreated rats was similar to the controlsinhibition by piperine of arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase ahh from 3methylcholanthrenetreated rats was comparable to that observed with 78benzoflavonepiperine caused noncompetitive inhibition of hepatic microsomal ahh from the untreated and 3methylcholanthrenetreated rats with a ki of 30 microm which was close to the apparent km of ahh observed in the controlssimilarly the kinetics of inhibition of ethylmorphinendemethylase from control rat liver microsomes exhibited noncompetitive inhibition with an apparent km of 08 mm and ki of 35 micromthese studies demonstrated that piperine is a nonspecific inhibitor of drug metabolism which shows little discrimination between different cytochrome p450 formsoral administration of piperine in rats strongly inhibited the hepatic ahh and udpglucuronyltransferase activitiesthe maximal inhibition of ahh observed within 1 hr restored to normal value in 6 hrpretreatment with piperine prolonged hexobarbital sleeping time and zoxazolamine paralysis time in mice at half the dose of skf525athese results demonstrate that piperine is a potent inhibitor of drug metabolism
