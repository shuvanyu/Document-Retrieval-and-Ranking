osteoarthritis oa has long been considered a wear and tear disease leading to loss of cartilageoa used to be considered the sole consequence of any process leading to increased pressure on one particular joint or fragility of cartilage matrixprogress in molecular biology in the 1990s has profoundly modified this paradigmthe discovery that many soluble mediators such as cytokines or prostaglandins can increase the production of matrix metalloproteinases by chondrocytes led to the first steps of an inflammatory theoryhowever it took a decade before synovitis was accepted as a critical feature of oa and some studies are now opening the way to consider the condition a driver of the oa processrecent experimental data have shown that subchondral bone may have a substantial role in the oa process as a mechanical damper as well as a source of inflammatory mediators implicated in the oa pain process and in the degradation of the deep layer of cartilagethus initially considered cartilage driven oa is a much more complex disease with inflammatory mediators released by cartilage bone and synoviumlowgrade inflammation induced by the metabolic syndrome innate immunity and inflammaging are some of the more recent arguments in favor of the inflammatory theory of oa and highlighted in this reviewcopyright  2012 osteoarthritis research society internationalpublished by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
