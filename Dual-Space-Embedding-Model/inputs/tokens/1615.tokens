obesity is a significant risk factor for developing osteoarthritis in weightbearing and nonweightbearing jointsalthough the pathogenesis of obesityassociated osteoarthritis is not completely understood recent studies indicate that proinflammatory metabolic factors contribute to an increase in osteoarthritis riskadipose tissue and in particular infrapatellar fat is a local source of proinflammatory mediators that are increased with obesity and have been shown to increase cartilage degradation in cell and tissue culture modelsone adipokine in particular leptin may be a critical mediator of obesityassociated osteoarthritis via synergistic actions with other inflammatory cytokinesbiomechanical factors may also increase the risk of osteoarthritis by activating cellular inflammation and promoting oxidative stresshowever some types of biomechanical stimulation such as physiologic cyclic loading inhibit inflammation and protect against cartilage degradationa high percentage of obese individuals with knee osteoarthritis are sedentary suggesting that a lack of physical activity may increase the susceptibility to inflammationa more comprehensive approach to understanding how obesity alters daily biomechanical exposures within joint tissues may provide new insight into the protective and damaging effects of biomechanical factors on inflammation in osteoarthritis
