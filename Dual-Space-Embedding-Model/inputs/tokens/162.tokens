it has been speculated that maternal phthalate exposure may affect reproductive development in human newbornshowever the mechanism awaits further investigationthe aim is to evaluate the association between maternal phthalate exposure and cord sex steroid hormones in pregnant women and their newborns from the general populationa total of 155 maternal and infant pair were recruited and analyzedlevels of urinary phthalate metabolites and sex steroid hormones were determined using liquid chromatographyelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry lcesimsms and radioimmunoassay ria respectivelyno significant correlation was found between each steroid hormones and phthalate metabolites for male newborns except mmp was marginally significantly correlated with e2after adjusting for maternal age estradiol e2 levels in cord serum from male newborns were not correlated with maternal urinary phthalate metabolitesin female newborns the maternal urinary levels of mono2ethylhexyl phthalate mehp and mono2ethyl5hydroxyhexyl phthalate 5ohmehp were negatively correlated with the free testosterone ft and fte2 levels in cord serum with pearson correlation coefficients ranging between 024 and 029 p005additionally after gestational age was adjusted the maternal urinary level of dehp was negatively correlated with the free testosterone ft and fte2 levels in cord serumwe suggest that maternal exposure to phthalates may affect sex steroid hormones status in fetal and newborn stagecopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
