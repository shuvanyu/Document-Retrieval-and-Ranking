objective the aim of this work was to determine the bioavailability of herbs and spices after human consumption by measuring the ability to protect lymphocytes from an oxidative injury and by examining the impact on inflammatory biomarkers in activated thp1 cellsmethods ten to 12 subjects in each of 13 groups consumed a defined amount of herb or spice for 7 daysblood was drawn from subjects before consumption and 1 hour after taking the final herb or spice capsulessubject serum and various extractions of the herbs and spices were analyzed for antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac analysis or by 11diphenyl2picrylhydrzyl dpphsubject peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs in medium with10 autologous serum were incubated with hydrogen peroxide to induce dna strand breakssubject serum was also used to treat activated thp1 cells to determine relative quantities of 3 inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factorα tnfα interleukin1α il1α and il6 mrnasresults herbs and spices that protected pbmcs against dna strand breaks were paprika rosemary ginger heattreated turmeric sage and cuminpaprika also appeared to protect cells from normal apoptotic processesof the 3 cytokine mrnas studied tnfα il1α and il6 tnfα was the most sensitive responder to oxidized ldltreated macrophagesclove ginger rosemary and turmeric were able to significantly reduce oxidized ldlinduced expression of tnfαserum from those consuming ginger reduced all three inflammatory biomarkersginger rosemary and turmeric showed protective capacity by both oxidative protection and inflammation measuresconclusions dna strand breaks and inflammatory biomarkers are a good functional measure of a foods bioavailability
