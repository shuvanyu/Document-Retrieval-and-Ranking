objective it is important to identify modifiable factors that may lower gestational diabetes mellitus gdm riskdietary iron is of particular interest given that iron is a strong prooxidant and high body iron levels can damage pancreatic Î²cell function and impair glucose metabolismthe current study is to determine if prepregnancy dietary and supplemental iron intakes are associated with the risk of gdmresearch design and methods a prospective study was conducted among 13475 women who reported a singleton pregnancy between 1991 and 2001 in the nurses health study iia total of 867 incident gdm cases were reportedpooled logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk rr of gdm by quintiles of iron intake controlling for dietary and nondietary risk factorsresults dietary heme iron intake was positively and significantly associated with gdm riskafter adjusting for age bmi and other risk factors rrs 95 cis across increasing quintiles of heme iron were 10 reference 111 087143 131 103168 151 117193 and 158 121208 respectively p for linear trend 00001the multivariate adjusted rr for gdm associated with every 05mg per day of increase in intake was 122 110136no significant associations were observed between total dietary nonheme or supplemental iron intake and gdm riskconclusions these findings suggest that higher prepregnancy intake of dietary heme iron is associated with an increased gdm risk
