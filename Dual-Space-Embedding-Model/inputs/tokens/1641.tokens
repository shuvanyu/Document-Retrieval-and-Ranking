objective epidemiological studies suggest that high body iron stores are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetesthe aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dietary intake of iron and the risk of type 2 diabetesresearch design and methods we conducted a prospective cohort study within the nurses health studywe followed 85031 healthy women aged 3459 years from 1980 to 2000dietary data were collected every 4 years and data on medical history and lifestyle factors were updated bienniallyresults during the 20 years of followup we documented 4599 incident cases of type 2 diabeteswe found no association between total dietary supplemental or nonheme iron and the risk of type 2 diabeteshowever heme iron intake derived from animal products was positively associated with risk relative risks rrs across increasing quintiles of cumulative intake were 100 108 95 ci 097119 120 109133 127 114141 and 128 114145 ptrend  00001 after controlling for age bmi and other nondietary and dietary risk factorsin addition when we modeled heme iron in seven categories the multivariate rr comparing women who consumed  or 225 mgday and those with intake 075 mgday was 152 122188the association between heme iron and the risk of diabetes was significant in both overweight and lean womenconclusions this large cohort study suggests that higher heme iron intake is associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes
