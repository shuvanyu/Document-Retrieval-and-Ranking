background fatty acids play a vital role in glucose homeostasis however studies on habitual dietary fat intakes and gestational diabetes mellitus gdm risk are limited and provide conflicting findingsobjective we determined whether the total amount and the type and source of prepregnancy dietary fats are related to risk of gdmdesign a prospective study was conducted in 13475 women who reported a singleton pregnancy between 1991 and 2001 in the nurses health study iiin these women 860 incident gdm cases were reportedthe adjusted rr of gdm was estimated for quintiles of total fat specific fat and the source of fat intakes by pooled logistic regressionresults higher animal fat and cholesterol intakes were significantly associated with increased gdm riskacross increasing quintiles of animal fat rrs 95 cis for gdm were 100 reference 155 120 198 143 109 188 140 104 189 and 188 136 260 ptrend  005corresponding rrs 95 cis for dietary cholesterol were 100 reference 108 084 132 102 078 129 120 093 155 and 145 111 189 ptrend  004the substitution of 5 of energy from animal fat for an equal percentage of energy from carbohydrates was associated with significantly increased risk of gdm rr 95 ci 113 108 118 p  00001no significant associations were observed between dietary polyunsaturated fat monounsaturated fat or trans fat intakes and gdm riskconclusion higher prepregnancy intakes of animal fat and cholesterol were associated with elevated gdm risk
