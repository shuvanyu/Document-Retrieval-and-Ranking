capsicumderived ingredients function as skinconditioning agentsmiscellaneous external analgesics flavoring agents or fragrance components in cosmeticsthese ingredients are used in 19 cosmetic products at concentrations as high as 5cosmeticgrade material may be extracted using hexane ethanol or vegetable oil and contain the full range of phytocompounds that are found in the capsicum annuum or capsicum frutescens plant aka red chiles including capsaicinaflatoxin and nnitroso compounds nnitrosodimethylamine and nnitrosopyrrolidine have been detected as contaminantsthe ultraviolet uv absorption spectrum for capsicum annuum fruit extract indicates a small peak at approximately 275 nm and a gradual increase in absorbance beginning at approximately 400 nmcapsicum and paprika are generally recognized as safe by the us food and drug administration for use in foodhexane chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts of capsicum frutescens fruit at 200 mgkg resulted in death of all micein a shortterm inhalation toxicity study using rats no difference was found between vehicle control and a 7 capsicum oleoresin solutionin a 4week feeding study red chilli capsicum annuum in the diet at concentrations up to 10 was relatively nontoxic in groups of male micein an 8week feeding study using rats intestinal exfoliation cytoplasmic fatty vacuolation and centrilobular necrosis of hepatocytes and aggregation of lymphocytes in the portal areas were seen at 10 capsicum frutescens fruit but not 2rats fed 05 gkg day1 crude capsicum fruit extract for 60 days exhibited no significant gross pathology at necropsy but slight hyperemia of the liver and reddening of the gastric mucosa were observedweanling rats fed basal diets supplemented with whole red pepper at concentrations up to 50 for up to 8 weeks had no pathology of the large intestines livers and kidneys but destruction of the taste buds and keratinization and erosion of the gastrointestinal gi tract were noted in groups fed 05 to 50 red pepperthe results of 9and 12month extension of this study showed normal large intestines and kidneysin rabbits fed capsicum annuum powder at 5 mgkg day1 in the diet daily for 12 months damage to the liver and spleen was noteda rabbit skin irritation test of capsicum annuum fruit extract at concentrations ranging from 01 to 10 produced no irritation but capsicum frutescens fruit extract induced concentrationdependent at 25 to 500 microgml cytotoxicity in a human buccal mucosa fibroblast cell linean ethanol extract of red chili was mutagenic in salmonella typhimurium ta98 but not in ta100 or in escherichia coliother genotoxicity assays gave a similar pattern of mixed resultsadenocarcinoma of the abdomen was observed in 720 mice fed 100 mg red chilies per day for 12 months no tumors were seen in control animalsneoplastic changes in the liver and intestinal tumors were observed in rats fed red chili powder at 80 mgkg day1 for 30 days intestinal and colon tumors were seen in rats fed red chili powder and 12dimethyl hydrazine but no tumors were observed in controlsin another study in rats however red chile pepper in the diet at the same dose decreased the number of tumors seen with 12dimethylhydrazineother feeding studies evaluated the effect of red chili peppers on the incidence of stomach tumors produced by nmethylnnitronnitrosoguanidine finding that red pepper had a promoting effectcapsicum frutescens fruit extract promoted the carcinogenic effect of methylacetoxymethylnitrosamine carcinogen or benzene hexachloride hepatocarcinogen in inbred male and female balbc mice dosed orally tongue applicationclinical findings include symptoms of cough sneezing and runny nose in chili factory workershuman respiratory responses to capsicum oleoresin spray include burning of the throat wheezing dry cough shortness of breath gagging gasping inability to breathe or speak and rarely cyanosis apnea and respiratory arresta trade name mixture containing 1 to 5 capsicum frutescens fruit extract induced very slight erythema in 1 of 10 volunteers patch tested for 48 h capsicum frutescens fruit extract at 0025 in a repeatedinsult patch test using 103 subjects resulted in no clinically meaningful irritation or allergic contact dermatitisone epidemiological study indicated that chili pepper consumption may be a strong risk factor for gastric cancer in populations with high intakes of chili pepper however other studies did not find this associationcapsaicin functions as an external analgesic a fragrance ingredient and as a skinconditioning agentmiscellaneous in cosmetic products but is not in current usecapsaicin is not generally recognized as safe and effective by the us food and drug administration for fever blister and cold sore treatment but is considered to be safe and effective as an external analgesic counterirritantingested capsaicin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine in animal studiessubcutaneous injection of capsaicin in rats resulted in a rise in the blood concentration reaching a maximum at 5 h the highest tissue concentrations were in the kidney and lowest in the liverin vitro percutaneous absorption of capsaicin has been demonstrated in human rat mouse rabbit and pig skinenhancement of the skin permeation of naproxen nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent in the presence of capsaicin has also been demonstratedpharmacological and physiological studies demonstrated that capsaicin which contains a vanillyl moiety produces its sensory effects by activating a ca2 permeable ion channel on sensory neuronscapsaicin is a known activator of vanilloid receptor 1capsaicininduced stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis has been shown using bull seminal vesicles and rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytescapsaicin inhibits protein synthesis in vero kidney cells and human neuroblastoma shsy5y cells in vitro and inhibits growth of e coli pseudomonas solanacearum and bacillus subtilis bacterial cultures but not saccharomyces cerevisiaeoral ld50 values as low as 1612 mgkg rats and 1188 mgkg mice have been reported for capsaicin in acute oral toxicity studies with hemorrhage of the gastric fundus observed in some of the animals that diedintravenous intraperitoneal and subcutaneous ld50 values were lowerin subchronic oral toxicity studies using mice capsaicin produced statistically significant differences in the growth rate and liverbody weight increasescapsaicin is an ocular irritant in mice rats and rabbitsdoserelated edema was observed in animals receiving capsaicin injections into the hindpaw rats or application to the ear micein guinea pigs dinitrochlorobenzene contact dermatitis was enhanced in the presence of capsaicin injected subcutaneously whereas dermal application inhibited sensitization in miceimmune system effects have been observed in neonatal rats injected subcutaneously with capsaicincapsaicin produced mixed results in s typhimurium micronucleus and sisterchromatid exchange genotoxicity assayspositive results for capsaicin were reported in dna damage assayscarcinogenic cocarcinogenic anticarcinogenic antitumorigenic tumor promotion and antitumor promotion effects of capsaicin have been reported in animal studiesexcept for a significant reduction in crownrump length in day 18 rats injected subcutaneously with capsaicin 50 mgkg on gestation days 14 16 18 or 20 no reproductive or developmental toxicity was notedin pregnant mice dosed subcutaneously with capsaicin depletion of substance p in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of pregnant females and fetuses was notedin clinical tests nerve degeneration of intracutaneous nerve fibers and a decrease in pain sensation induced by heat and mechanical stimuli were evident in subjects injected intradermally with capsaicinan increase in mean inspiratory flow was reported for eight normal subjects who inhaled nebulized 107 m capsaicinthe results of provocative and predictive tests involving human subjects indicated that capsaicin is a skin irritantoverall studies suggested that these ingredients can be irritating at low concentrationsalthough the genotoxicity carcinogenicity and tumor promotion potential of capsaicin have been demonstrated so have opposite effectsskin irritation and other tumorpromoting effects of capsaicin appear to be mediated through interaction with the same vanilloid receptorgiven this mechanism of action and the observation that many tumor promoters are irritating to the skin the panel considered it likely that a potent tumor promoter may also be a moderate to severe skin irritantthus a limitation on capsaicin content that would significantly reduce its skin irritation potential is expected to in effect lessen any concerns relating to tumor promotion potentialbecause capsaicin enhanced the penetration of an antiinflammatory agent through human skin the panel recommends that care should be exercised in using ingredients that contain capsaicin in cosmetic productsthe panel advised industry that the total polychlorinated biphenyl pcbpesticide contamination should be limited to not more than 40 ppm with not more than 10 ppm for any specific residue and agreed on the following limitations for other impurities arsenic 3 mgkg max heavy metals 0002 max and lead 5 mgkg maxindustry was also advised that aflatoxin should not be present in these ingredients the panel adopted  or 15 ppb as corresponding to negative aflatoxin content and that ingredients derived from capsicum annuum and capsicum frutescens plant species should not be used in products where nnitroso compounds may be formedabstract truncated
