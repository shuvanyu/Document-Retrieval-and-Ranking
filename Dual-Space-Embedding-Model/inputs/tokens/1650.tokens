retinal pigment epithelium rpe cells are vital for retinal healthhowever they are susceptible to injury with ageing and exposure to excessive light including uv 100380 nm and visible 380760 nm radiationto evaluate the protective effect of blueberry anthocyanins on rpe cells in vitro cell models of replicative senescent and lightinduced damage were established in the present studyafter purification and fractionation blueberry anthocyanin extracts bae were yielded with total anthocyanin contents of 310 sd 05  and were used in this studyreplicative senescence of rpe cells was induced by repeatedly passaging cells from the fourth passage to the tenthfrom the fifth passage cultured rpe cells began to enter a replicative senescence exhibiting reduced cell proliferation along with an increase in the number of βgalactosidasepositive cellsrpe cells maintained high cell viability p  001 and a low p  001 percentage of βgalactosidasepositive cells when treated with 01 μgml baein contrast after exposure to 2500 sd 500 lx light 420800 nm for 12 h rpe cells in the positive control light exposure no bae treatment exhibited premature senescence low p  001 cell viability and increased p  001 vascular endothelial growth factor vegf release compared with negative control cells which were not subjected to light irradiation and bae exposurecorrespondingly bae is beneficial to rpe cells by protecting these cells against lightinduced damage through the suppression of ageing and apoptosis as well as the downregulation of the overexpressed vegf to normal levelthese results demonstrate that bae is efficacious against senescence and lightinduced damage of rpe cells
