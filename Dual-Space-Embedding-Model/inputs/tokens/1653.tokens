purpose goji berry lycium barbarum l is purported to benefit vision because of its high antioxidant especially zeaxanthin content although this effect has not been demonstrated in highquality human studiesthe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of daily supplementation with a proprietary milkbased formulation of goji berry lactowolfberry lwb on macular characteristics and plasma zeaxanthin and antioxidant capacity levels in elderly subjectsmethods this was a doublemasked randomized placebocontrolled trial in healthy elderly subjects range 65 to 70 years receiving 137 gd of lwb n  75 or placebo n  75 for 90 dayssubjects underwent direct ophthalmic examination to assess pigmentation and soft drusen count in the macula and a blood draw to measure plasma zeaxanthin level and total antioxidant capacityresults the placebo group demonstrated hypopigmentation and soft drusen accumulation in the macula whereas the lwb group remained stableboth plasma zeaxanthin level and antioxidant capacity increased significantly in the lwb group by 26 and 57 respectively but did not change in the placebo groupno productrelated adverse events were reported in either groupconclusions overall daily dietary supplementation with goji berry for 90 days increases plasma zeaxanthin and antioxidant levels as well as protects from hypopigmentation and soft drusen accumulation in the macula of elderly subjectshowever the mechanism of action is unclear given the lack of relationship between change in plasma zeaxanthin and change in macular characteristics
