lutein and zeaxanthin are thought to decrease the incidence of agerelated macular degeneration amd however findings have been inconsistentwe conducted a systematic literature review and metaanalysis to evaluate the relationship between dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin and amd riskrelevant studies were identified by searching five databases up to april 2010reference lists of articles were retrieved and experts were contactedliterature search data extraction and study quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers and results were pooled quantitatively using metaanalysis methodsthe potential sources of heterogeneity and publication bias were also estimatedthe search yielded six longitudinal cohort studiesthe pooled relative risk rr for early amd comparing the highest with the lowest category of lutein and zeaxanthin intake was 096 95  ci 078 117dietary intake of these carotenoids was significantly related with a reduction in risk of late amd rr 074 95  ci 057 097 and a statistically significant inverse association was observed between lutein and zeaxanthin intake and neovascular amd risk rr 068 95  ci 051 092the results were essentially consistent among subgroups stratified by participant characteristicsthe findings of the present metaanalysis indicate that dietary lutein and zeaxanthin is not significantly associated with a reduced risk of early amd whereas an increase in the intake of these carotenoids may be protective against late amdhowever additional studies are needed to confirm these relationships
