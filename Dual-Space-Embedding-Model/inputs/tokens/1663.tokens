purpose age and advanced disease in the fellow eye are the two most important risk factors for agerelated macular degeneration amdin this study the authors investigated the relationship between these variables and the optical density of macular pigment mp in a group of subjects from a northern european populationmethods the optical density of mp was measured psychophysically in 46 subjects ranging in age from 21 to 81 years with healthy maculae and in 9 healthy eyes known to be at highrisk of amd because of advanced disease in the fellow eyeeach eye in the latter group was matched with a control eye on the basis of variables believed to be associated with the optical density of mp iris color gender smoking habits age and lens densityresults there was an agerelated decline in the optical density of macular pigment among volunteers with no ocular disease right eye r2  029 p  00006 left eye r2  029 p  00001healthy eyes predisposed to amd had significantly less mp than healthy eyes at no such risk wilcoxons signed rank test p  0015conclusions the two most important risk factors for amd are associated with a relative absence of mpthese findings are consistent with the hypothesis that supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin may delay avert or modify the course of this disease
