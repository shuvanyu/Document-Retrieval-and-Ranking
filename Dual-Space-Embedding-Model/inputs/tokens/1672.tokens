the elimination kinetics of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in humans is difficult to assess in observational studies because pcb exposure is never completely abolishedin a community with high dietary pcb exposures from whale blubber we examined two groups of children with increased body burdens from breastfeedingfollowup was from ages 45 years to 75 years 99 subjects and 7 to 14 years 101 subjectsthe calculations were performed by the use of structural equation models with adjustment for body weight and dietary blubber intake as the main source of postnatal exposureas a likely result of background exposures apparent elimination halflives were unexpectedly long when based on results from all cohort memberssubjects with exposures above the median and in the highest quartile showed halflives of about 34 years for cb138 and 4555 years for cb105 and cb118 6575 years for cb156 cb170 and cb187 and 79 years for cb153 and cb180the longest halflives correspond to elimination of the parent pcb solely with a daily fat excretion rate of 12 g while shorter halflives assume metabolic breakdown
