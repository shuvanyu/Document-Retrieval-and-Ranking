although the immunomodulatory effects of many herbs have been extensively studied research related to possible immunomodulatory effects of various spices is relatively scarcehere the potential immunomodulatory effects of black pepper and cardamom are investigatedour data show that black pepper and cardamom aqueous extracts significantly enhance splenocyte proliferation in a dosedependent synergistic fashionenzymelinked immunosorbent assay experiments reveal that black pepper and cardamom significantly enhance and suppress respectively t helper th1 cytokine release by splenocytesconversely th2 cytokine release by splenocytes is significantly suppressed and enhanced by black pepper and cardamom respectivelyexperimental evidence suggests that black pepper and cardamom extracts exert proinflammatory and antiinflammatory roles respectivelyconsistently nitric oxide production by macrophages is significantly augmented and reduced by black pepper and cardamom respectivelyremarkably it is evident that black pepper and cardamom extracts significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells indicating their potential anticancer effectsour findings strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom exert immunomodulatory roles and antitumor activities and hence they manifest themselves as natural agents that can promote the maintenance of a healthy immune systemwe anticipate that black pepper and cardamom constituents can be used as potential therapeutic tools to regulate inflammatory responses and preventattenuate carcinogenesis
