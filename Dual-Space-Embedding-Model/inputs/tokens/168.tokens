aims serum cobalamin cbl vitamin b12 tests are routinely ordered for investigating conditions potentially amenable to cbl supplementationthis study aimed to systematically assess the evidence of diagnostic accuracy for serum cbl tests across patient subgroupsmethods seven medical databases were searched 1990 to november 2009studies were included that compared serum cbl to a reference standard all reference standards employedstudy quality was assessed using quadassummary estimates of test performance were determined using the bivariate model and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves hsrocresults of 2878 identified studies 54 were includedstudies rated poorly against quadas criteriapositive plr and negative likelihood ratios nlr were 272 95 confidence interval ci 195 381 and 059 049 072 respectively studies employing methylmalonic acid as the referentin studies employing a clinical reference standard plr was 333 092 1210 and nlr 034 013 089test performance did not vary by clinical indication test method or ageconclusion this review was limited by the quality of the evidence base and lack of a gold standardfrom the available evidence diagnosis of conditions amenable to cbl supplementation on the basis of serum cbl level alone cannot be considered a reliable approach to investigating suspected vitamin deficiency
