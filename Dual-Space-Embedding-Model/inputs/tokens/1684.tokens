several cohort studies have examined the association of carotid intimamedia thickness imt with the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction in apparently healthy personswe investigated the predictive value of imt of cardiovascular mortality in elderly communitydwelling people beyond the prediction provided by age and mmseassessed by means of a multivariate cox modelcarotid imt and plaque were evaluated bilaterally with ultrasonography in 298 people older than 75 years  120 men and 178 women average age 796 yearsthe lilac study started on july 25 2000consultations were repeated every yearthe followup ended on november 30 2004during the mean followup span of 1152 days 30 subjects 21 men and nine women diednine deaths were attributable to cardiovascular causes imyocardial infarction two men and three women stroke two men and two womenthe age and mmseadjusted relative risk rr and 95 confidence interval 95 ci of developing allcause mortality was assesseda 03 mm increase in left imt was associated with a rr of predicted 1647 10752524 and a similar increase in right imt with a rr of 3327 14297746for cardiovascular mortality the corresponding rr values were 2351 10295372 and 2890 10597891 respectivelycarotid imt assessed by ultrasonography is positively associated with an increased risk of allcause and cardiovascular death in elderly communitydwelling people
