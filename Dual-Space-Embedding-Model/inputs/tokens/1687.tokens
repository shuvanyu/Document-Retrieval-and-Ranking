the need for consistent and current data describing the true incidence of sca andor scd was highlighted during the most recent sudden cardiac arrest thought leadership alliances scatla think tank meeting of national experts with broad representation of key stakeholders including thought leaders and representatives from the american college of cardiology american heart association and the heart rhythm societyas such to evaluate the true magnitude of this public health problem we performed a systematic literature search in medline using the mesh headings death sudden or the terms sudden cardiac death or sudden cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest or cardiac death or sudden death or arrhythmic death study selection criteria included peerreviewed publications of primary data used to estimate scd incidence in the us we used web of sciences cited reference search to evaluate the impact of each primary estimate on the medical literature by determining the number of times each primary source has been citedthe estimated us annual incidence of scd varied widely from 180000 to  450000 among 6 included studiesthese different estimates were in part due to different data sources with data age ranging from 1980 to 2007 definitions of scd case ascertainment criteria methods of estimationextrapolation and sources of case ascertainmentthe true incidence of sca andor scd in the us remains unclear with a wide range in the available estimates which are badly datedas reliable estimates of scd incidence are important for improving risk stratification and prevention future efforts are clearly needed to establish uniform definitions of sca and scd and then to prospectively and precisely capture cases of sca and scd in the overall us population
