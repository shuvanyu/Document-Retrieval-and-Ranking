background to investigate whether the chinese lactovegetarian diet has protective effects on metabolic and cardiovascular disease cvdmethods one hundred sixtynine healthy chinese lactovegetarians and 126 healthy omnivore men aged 2176 years were enrolledanthropometric indexes lipid profile insulin sensitivity pancreatic β cell function and intimamedia thickness imt of carotid arteries were assessed and comparedcardiovascular risk points and probability of developing cvd in 510 years in participants aged 2455 years were calculatedresults compared with omnivores lactovegetarians had remarkably lower body mass index systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum levels of triglyceride total cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol apolipoprotein b γglutamyl transferase serum creatinine uric acid fasting blood glucose as well as lower total cholesterolhighdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ratiovegetarians also had higher homeostasis model assessment β cell function and insulin secretion index and thinner carotid imt than the omnivores didthese results corresponded with lower cardiovascular risk points and probability of developing cvd in 510 years in vegetarians 2455 years oldconclusions in healthy chinese men the lactovegetarian diet seems to exert protective effects on blood pressure lipid profiles and metabolic parameters and results in significantly lower carotid imtlower cvd risks found in vegetarians also reflect the beneficial effect of the chinese lactovegetarian diet
