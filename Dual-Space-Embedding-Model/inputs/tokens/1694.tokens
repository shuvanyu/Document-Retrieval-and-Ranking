there is increasing evidence implicating a dietary source of plasma lipid peroxides that become elevated in the postprandial statethis phenomenon may be a contributing factor to the correlation found between postprandial hyperlipidemia and increased risk of cardiovascular diseaseusing a newly developed method for measuring lipid hydroperoxides directly in plasma a pilot study was performed which revealed that lipid hydroperoxides are indeed elevated following a fatty meallipid hydroperoxides increased within 24 h after the meal and returned to basal levels corresponding to the usual postprandial hyperlipidemiaa marked suppression of postprandial hydroperoxides was found when a meal was consumed with wine suggesting that these hydroperoxides can be formed and then absorbed during the digestive process
