objective we have previously shown that 300 kcal from glucose intake induces a significant increase in reactive oxygen species ros generation and nuclear factorkappab nfkappab binding in the circulating mononuclear cells in healthy normal subjectswe hypothesized that the intake of 300 calories as orange juice or fructose the other major carbohydrate in orange juice would induce a significantly smaller response than that of glucoseresearch design and methods four groups eight subjects each of normalweight subjects were given a 300cal drink of glucose 75 g fructose 75 g or orange juice or water sweetened with saccharin control group to drink and then blood samples were collectedresults there was a significant increase in ros generation by mononuclear cells by 130  18 p  0001 polymorph nuclear cells by 95  22 p  001 and in nfkappab binding in mononuclear cells by 82  16 p  001 over the baseline after 2 h of glucose intakethese changes were absent following fructose orange juice or water intakethere was significantly lower ros generation and nfkappab binding following orange juice fructose and water compared with glucose p  0001 for allfurthermore incubation of mononuclear cells in vitro with 50 mmoll of the flavonoids hesperetin or naringenin reduced ros generation by 52  7 and 77  8 p  001 respectively while fructose or ascorbic acid did not cause any changeconclusions caloric intake in the form of orange juice or fructose does not induce either oxidative or inflammatory stress possibly due to its flavonoids content and might therefore represent a potentially safe energy source
