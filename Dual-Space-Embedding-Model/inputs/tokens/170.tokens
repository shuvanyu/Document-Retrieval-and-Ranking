the public perceives that the nutritional quality of eggs produced as free range is superior to that of eggs produced in cagestherefore this study compared the nutrient content of freerange vs cageproduced shell eggs by examining the effects of the laboratory production environment and hen agea flock of 500 hyline brown layers were hatched simultaneously and received the same care ie vaccination lighting and feeding regimen with the only difference being access to the rangethe nutrient content of the eggs was analyzed for cholesterol n3 fatty acids saturated fat monounsaturated fat polyunsaturated fat Î²carotene vitamin a and vitamin e the same egg pool was divided and sent to 4 different laboratories for analysisthe laboratory was found to have a significant effect on the content of all nutrients in the analysis except for cholesteroltotal fat content in the samples varied p  0001 from a high of 888 to a low of 676 in laboratories d and c respectivelyeggs from the range production environment had more total fat p  005 monounsaturated fat p  005 and polyunsaturated fat p  0001 than eggs produced by caged henslevels of n3 fatty acids were also higher p  005 at 017 in range eggs vs 014 in cage eggsthe range environment had no effect on cholesterol 16342 and 16538 mg50 g in eggs from caged and range hens respectivelyvitamin a and e levels were not affected by the husbandry to which the hens were exposed but were lowest at 62 wk of agethe age of the hens did not influence the fat levels in the egg but cholesterol levels were highest p  0001 at 62 wk of age 17254 mg50 galthough range production did not influence the cholesterol level in the egg there was an increase in fat levels in eggs produced on the range
