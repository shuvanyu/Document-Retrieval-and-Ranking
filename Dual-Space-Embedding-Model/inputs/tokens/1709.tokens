several risk factors seem to play a role in the development of osteoporosisphytate is a naturally occurring compound that is ingested in significant amounts by those with diets rich in whole grainsthe aim of this study was to evaluate phytate consumption as a risk factor in osteoporosisin a first group of 1473 volunteer subjects bone mineral density was determined by means of dual radiological absorptiometry in the calcaneusin a second group of 433 subjects used for validation of results obtained for the first group bone mineral density was determined in the lumbar column and the neck of the femursubjects were individually interviewed about selected osteoporosis risk factorsdietary information related to phytate consumption was acquired by questionnaires conducted on two different occasions the second between 2 and 3 months after performing the first oneoneway analysis of variance or students t test was used to determine statistical differences between groupsbone mineral density increased with increasing phytate consumptionmultivariate linear regression analysis indicated that body weight and low phytate consumption were the risk factors with greatest influence on bone mineral densityphytate consumption had a protective effect against osteoporosis suggesting that low phytate consumption should be considered an osteoporosis risk factor
