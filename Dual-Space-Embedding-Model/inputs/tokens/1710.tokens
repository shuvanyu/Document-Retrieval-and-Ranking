zinc metabolism in male rats was studied by combining nutritional balance methods with an analysis of 65zn kineticsthe rats two groups of 84 each were fed zincadequate diets 33 ppm zn with either 0 basal or 2 phytic acid added as sodium phytatea fourthorder exponential function described the timecourse of 65zn in plasma and compartmental models were developed accordinglyplasma zinc exchanged more rapidly with zinc in liver and kidneys than it did with zinc in testes skeletal muscle or bonetotal body zinc content 26 mg100 g live body weight measured chemically was about 9 times higher than estimates of exchangeable zinc in the bodywholebody retention of 65zn was higher and endogenous fecal zinc excretion was lower in rats fed phytate than in those fed the basal diet these responses to phytate may reflect a homeostatic adjustment to decreased absorption of zincrespective values for apparent absorption and true absorption of zinc were 13 and 32 of zinc intake in rats fed phytate and 19 and 46 of zinc intake in rats fed the basal dietwhen whole grains or mature seeds constitute a major portion of the diet the phytate zinc molar ratio may approach that 601 used in our studywhether or not phytic acid occurring naturally in foods affects zinc metabolism to the same extent as sodium phytate can not be determined from our study
