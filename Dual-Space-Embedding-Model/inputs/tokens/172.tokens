background in coronary artery disease exercise training et is associated with an improvement in endothelial function but little is known about the relative effect of different types of trainingthe purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the effect of different types of et on endothelial function in 209 patients after a first recent acute myocardial infarctionmethods and results endothelial function was evaluated before and after 4 weeks of different types of et and after 1 month of detraining by measuring flowmediated dilation and von willebrand factor levels at baseline and after etpatients were randomized into 4 groups group 1 aerobic et n52 group 2 resistance training n54 group 3 resistance plus aerobic training n53 and group 4 no training n50at baseline flowmediated dilation was 4526 in group 1 40116 in group 2 444 in group 3 and 4323 in group 4 pnsafter et flowmediated dilation increased to 9925 in group 1 10126 in group 2 and 1083 in group 3 p001 versus baseline for all groups it also increased in group 4 but to a much lesser extent to 5125 p001 versus trained groupsthe von willebrand factor level after et decreased by 16 p001 similarly in groups 1 2 and 3 but remained unchanged in group 4detraining returned flowmediated dilation to baseline levels p001 versus posttrainingconclusions in patients with recent acute myocardial infarction et was associated with improved endothelial function independently of the type of training but this effect disappeared after 1 month of detraining
