the hairtoblood ratio and biological halflife of methylmercury in a onecompartment model seem to differ between past and recent studiesto reevaluate them 27 healthy volunteers were exposed to methylmercury at the provisional tolerable weekly intake 34 µgkg body weightweek for adults through fish consumption for 14 weeks followed by a 15week washout period after the cessation of exposureblood was collected every 1 or 2 weeks and hair was cut every 4 weekstotal mercury thg concentrations were analyzed in blood and hairthe thg levels of blood and hair changed with time p  0001the mean concentrations increased from 67 ngg at week 0 to 269 ngg at week 14 in blood and from 23 to 88 µgg in hairthe mean hairtoblood ratio after the adjustment for the time lag from blood to hair was 344  54 sdfor the entire periodthe halflives of thg were calculated from raw data to be 94  23 days for blood and 102  31 days for hair but the halflives recalculated after subtracting the background levels from the raw data were 57  18 and 64  22 days respectivelyin conclusion the hairtoblood ratio of methylmercury based on past studies appears to be underestimated in light of recent studiesthe crude halflife may be preferred rather than the recalculated one because of the practicability and uncertainties of the background level though the latter halflife may approximate the conventional one
