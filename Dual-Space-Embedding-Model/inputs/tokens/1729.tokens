exposure to methylmercury at any stage of central nervous system development could induce alterations and result in severe congenital abnormalitiestotal mercury level in maternal hair during pregnancy correlates well with blood levels of methylmercury and with total mercury levels in fetal braina prospective study has been conducted and a total of 137 childbearing women living at the coastal region with term normal pregnancies were included and their newborns evaluated by ultrasonographymothers and their newborns are divided in two groups according to their hair mercury levels examined group with high body levels of mercury  1 μgg and control group with low body levels of mercury 1 μggneurosonographic examination was conducted to all newbornstwo dimensions of cerebellum in the sagitalmedial plane have been measured maximum height and width starting from the roof of the fourth chambermajority of mothers had hair mercury levels lower than 1 μgg n  107mean value was 088 μgg sd 124 ranging from 002 to 871 μggthere was no significant difference between the two groups when it comes to the width of cerebellum mannwhitney test z  1471 p  0141however comparison related to the length of cerebellum shows statistically significant smaller cerebellum in newborns whose mother had hair mercury levels higher than 1 μgg mannwhitney test z  2329 p  0019our results lead to a conclusion that prenatal exposure to what we consider to be lowlevels of methylmercury does influence fetal brain development detected as decreased size of newborns cerebellumfrom a clinical point of view a question related to the influence of prenatal lowlevel methylmercury exposure on fetal neurodevelopment remains openour further objectives are to direct the research towards performing detailed neuropshychological tests on children at the age of 18 monthssuch tests could indicate the presence of subtle neurological or neuropsychological deficitscopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
