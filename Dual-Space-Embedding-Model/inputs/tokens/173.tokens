background observational evidence has consistently linked increased fruit and vegetable consumption with reduced cardiovascular morbidity however there is little direct trial evidence to support the concept that fruit and vegetable consumption improves vascular functionthis study assessed the dosedependent effects of a fruit and vegetable intervention on arterial health in subjects with hypertensionmethods and results after a 4week runin period during which fruit and vegetable intake was limited to 1 portion per day participants were randomized to consume either 1 3 or 6 portions daily for the next 8 weeksendotheliumdependent and independent arterial vasodilator responses were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography in the brachial circulation before and after interventioncompliance was monitored with serial contemporaneous 4day food records and by measuring concentrations of circulating dietary biomarkersa total of 117 volunteers completed the 12week studyparticipants in the 1 3 and 6portionsd groups reported consuming on average 11 32 and 56 portions of fruit and vegetables respectively and serum concentrations of lutein and betacryptoxanthin increased across the groups in a dosedependent mannerfor each 1portion increase in reported fruit and vegetable consumption there was a 62 improvement in forearm blood flow responses to intraarterial administration of the endotheliumdependent vasodilator acetylcholine p003there was no association between increased fruit and vegetable consumption and vasodilator responses to sodium nitroprusside an endotheliumindependent vasodilatorconclusions the present study illustrates that among hypertensive volunteers increased fruit and vegetable consumption produces significant improvements in an established marker of endothelial function and cardiovascular prognosis
