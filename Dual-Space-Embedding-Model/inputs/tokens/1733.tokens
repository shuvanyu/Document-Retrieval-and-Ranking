background some persistent environmental chemicals are suspected of causing an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus a disease particularly common after age 70this concern was examined in a crosssectional study of elderly subjects in a population with elevated contaminant exposures from seafood species high in the food chainmethods clinical examinations of 713 faroese residents aged 7074 years 64 of eligible population included fasting plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin and glycosylated hemoglobinlifetime exposure to persistent environmental chemicals from pilot whale and other traditional food was estimated from a dietary questionnaire and by analysis of blood samples for polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and related food contaminantsresults septuagenarians with type 2 diabetes or impaired fasting glycemia tended to have higher pcb concentrations and higher past intake of traditional foods especially during childhood and adolescencein nondiabetic subjects the fasting insulin concentration decreased by 7 95 ci 12 to 2 for each doubling of the pcb concentration after adjustment for sex and body mass index at age 20conversely the fasting glucose concentration increased by 6 1 to 13 for each doubling in pcbsimilar associations were seen in subjects without impaired fasting glycemia while further adjustment for current body mass index and lipid metabolism parameters attenuated some of the associationsconclusions impaired insulin secretion appears to constitute an important part of the type 2 diabetes pathogenesis associated with exposure to persistent lipophilic food contaminants
