background mercury hg is a toxic metal that presents public health risks through fish consumptiona major source of uncertainty in evaluating harmful exposure is inadequate knowledge of hg concentrations in commercially important seafoodobjectives we examined patterns variability and knowledge gaps of hg in common commercial seafood items in the united states and compared seafood hg concentrations from our database to those used for exposure estimates and consumption advicemethods we developed a database of hg concentrations in fish and shellfish common to the us market by aggregating available data from government monitoring programs and the scientific literaturewe calculated a grand mean for individual seafood items based on reported means from individual studies weighted by sample sizewe also compared database results to those of federal programs and human health criteria us food and drug administration hg monitoring program fdamp us environmental protection agency eparesults mean hg concentrations for each seafood item were highly variable among studies spanning 0324 orders of magnitudefarmed fish generally had lower grand mean hg concentrations than their wild counterparts with wild seafood having 2 to12fold higher concentrations depending on the seafood itemhowever farmed fish are relatively understudied as are specific seafood items and seafood imports from asia and south americafinally we found large discrepancies between mean hg concentrations estimated from our database and fdamp estimates for most seafood items examinedconclusions the high variability in hg in common seafood items has considerable ramifications for public health and the formulation of consumption guidelinesexposure and risk analyses derived from smaller data sets do not reflect our collective available information on seafood hg concentrations
