rates of lung cancer in american men have greatly exceeded those in japanese men for several decades despite the higher smoking prevalence in japanese menit is not known whether the relative risk of lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking is lower in japanese men than american men and whether these risks vary by the amount and duration of smokingto estimate smokingspecific relative risks for lung cancer in men a multicentric casecontrol study was carried out in new york city washington dc and nagoya japan from 1992 to 1998a total of 371 cases and 373 agematched controls were interviewed in united states hospitals and 410 cases and 252 hospital controls in japanese hospitals 411 japanese agematched healthy controls were also randomly selected from electoral rollsthe odds ratio or for lung cancer in current united states smokers relative to nonsmokers was 404 95 confidence interval ci  218796 which was 10 times higher than the or of 35 for current smokers in japanese relative to hospital controls 95 ci  1675 and six times higher than in japanese relative to community controls or  63 95 ci  37109there were no substantial differences in the mean number of years of smoking or average daily number of cigarettes smoked between united states and japanese cases or between united states and japanese controls but american cases began smoking on average 25 years earlier than japanese casesthe risk of lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking was substantially higher in united states than in japanese males consistent with populationbased statistics on smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidencepossible explanations for this difference in risk include a more toxic cigarette formulation of american manufactured cigarettes as evidenced by higher concentrations of tobaccospecific nitrosamines in both tobacco and mainstream smoke the much wider use of activated charcoal in the filters of japanese than in american cigarettes as well as documented differences in genetic susceptibility and lifestyle factors other than smoking
