the endothelium is a highly metabolically active organ that is involved in many physiological processes including the control of vasomotor tone barrier function leukocyte adhesion and trafficking inflammation and hemostasisendothelial cell phenotypes are differentially regulated in space and timeendothelial cell heterogeneity has important implications for developing strategies in basic research diagnostics and therapeuticsthe goals of this review are to i consider mechanisms of endothelial cell heterogeneity ii discuss the benchtobedside gap in endothelial biomedicine iii revisit definitions for endothelial cell activation and dysfunction and iv propose new goals in diagnosis and therapyfinally these themes will be applied to an understanding of vascular bedspecific hemostasis
