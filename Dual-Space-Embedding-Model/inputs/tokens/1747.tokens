drug addiction and obesity appear to share several propertiesboth can be defined as disorders in which the saliency of a specific type of reward food or drug becomes exaggerated relative to and at the expense of others rewardsboth drugs and food have powerful reinforcing effects which are in part mediated by abrupt dopamine increases in the brain reward centresthe abrupt dopamine increases in vulnerable individuals can override the brains homeostatic control mechanismsthese parallels have generated interest in understanding the shared vulnerabilities between addiction and obesitypredictably they also engendered a heated debatespecifically brain imaging studies are beginning to uncover common features between these two conditions and delineate some of the overlapping brain circuits whose dysfunctions may underlie the observed deficitsthe combined results suggest that both obese and drugaddicted individuals suffer from impairments in dopaminergic pathways that regulate neuronal systems associated not only with reward sensitivity and incentive motivation but also with conditioning selfcontrol stress reactivity and interoceptive awarenessin parallel studies are also delineating differences between them that centre on the key role that peripheral signals involved with homeostatic control exert on food intakehere we focus on the shared neurobiological substrates of obesity and addiction 2012 the authorsobesity reviews  2012 international association for the study of obesity
