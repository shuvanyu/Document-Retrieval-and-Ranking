background the hypothalamus is the central homeostatic control region of the brain and therefore highly influenced by nutrients such as glucose and fatimmediate and prolonged homeostatic effects of glucose ingestion have been well characterizedhowever studies that used stimulation with fat have mainly investigated immediate perceptional processesbesides homeostatic processes the gustatory cortex including parts of the insular cortex is crucial for the processing of food itemsobjective the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high compared with lowfat meals on the hypothalamus and the insular cortexdesign eleven healthy men participated in a singleblinded functional mri study of high and lowfat meals on 2 measurement dayscerebral blood flow cbf was measured before and 30 and 120 min after intake of high and lowfat yogurtshunger was rated and blood samples were taken before each cbf measurementresults highfat yogurt induced a pronounced decrease in cbf in the hypothalamus and the corresponding cbf change correlated positively with the insulin changefurthermore insular activity increased after 120 min in the lowfat condition onlythe cbf change in both regions correlated positively in the highfat conditionconclusions the decrease in hypothalamic activity and the interaction with the insular cortex elicited by fat may contribute to an efficient energy homeostasistherefore fat might be a modulator of homeostatic and gustatory brain regions and their interactionthis trial was registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct01516021
