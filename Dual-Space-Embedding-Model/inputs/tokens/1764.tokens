background dietary intake of phosphorus is derived largely from protein sources and is a critical determinant of phosphorus balance in patients with chronic kidney diseaseinformation about the phosphorus content of prepared foods generally is unavailable but it is believed to contribute significantly to the phosphorus burden of patients with chronic kidney diseasedesign analysis of dietary componentssetting we measured the phosphorus content of 44 food products including 30 refrigerated or frozen precooked meat poultry and fish items generally national brandsoutcomes measured and reported phosphorus content of foodsmeasurements phosphorus by using association of analytical communities official method 98427 protein by using association of analytical communities official method 99003results we found that the ratio of phosphorus to protein content in these items ranged from 61 to 215 mg of phosphorus per 1 g of proteinthe mean ratio in the 19 food products with a label listing phosphorus as an additive was 146 mgg compared with 90 mgg in the 11 items without listed phosphorusthe phosphorus content of only 1 precooked food product was available in a widely used dietary databaselimitations results cannot be extrapolated to other productsmanufacturers also may alter the phosphorus content of foods at any timeprotein content was not directly measured for all foodsconclusion better reporting of phosphorus content of foods by manufacturers could result in improved dietary phosphorus control without risk of protein malnutrition
