campylobacter sppare nutritionally fastidious organisms that are sensitive to normal atmospheric oxygen levels and lack homologues of common cold shock genesat first glance these bacteria seem ill equipped to persist within food products under processing and storage conditions however they survive in numbers sufficient to cause the largest number of foodborne bacterial disease annuallya mechanism proposed to play a role in campylobacter survival is the addition of polyphosphatecontaining marinades during poultry processingcampylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli strains incubated in chicken exudates collected from poultry treated with a marinade demonstrated considerable survival advantages 1 to 4 log cfuml over the same strains incubated in chicken exudate from untreated birdspolyphosphates which constitute a large portion of the commercial poultry marinades were shown to account for a majority of the observed influence of the marinades on campylobacter survivalwhen six different food grade polyphosphates disodium pyrophosphate tetrasodium pyrophosphate pentasodium triphosphate sodium polyphosphate monosodium phosphate and trisodium phosphate were utilized to compare the survival of campylobacter strains in chicken exudate significant differences were observed with regard to campylobacter survival between the different polyphosphatesit was then determined that the addition of polyphosphates to chicken exudate increased the ph of the exudate with the more sodiated polyphosphates increasing the ph to a greater degree than the less sodiated polyphosphatesit was confirmed that the change in ph mediated by polyphosphates is responsible for the observed increases in campylobacter survival
