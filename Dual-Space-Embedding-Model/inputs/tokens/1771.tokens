background halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons including dioxins and nonhalogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ligands of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and stimulate its transformationexposure to these environmental contaminants occurs mainly through dietrecent articles demonstrated that certain food factors regulate the ahr transformation and expression of downstream drugmetabolizing enzymesobjective to explain the actions of these food factors on the ahr transformation as the mechanisms underlying are not fully understoodmethods this review introduces recent articles that have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms by which food factors regulate the ahr transformation and downstream drugmetabolizing enzymesresultsconclusion the role of classical ligands including dioxins as agonists of the receptor is well documentedas to the food factors they act as antagonists because they basically suppress the ahr transformation by different mechanismsmoreover the fate and metabolism of food factors are important to understand their mechanisms
