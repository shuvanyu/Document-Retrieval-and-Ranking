leflunomide flutamide nimodipine mexiletine sulindac tranilast 4hydroxytamoxifen and omeprazole are pharmaceuticals previously characterized as aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr agonists in various cell lines and animal modelsin this study the eight ahractive pharmaceuticals were investigated in highly aggressive aryl hydrocarbon ahresponsive bt474 and mdamb468 breast cancer cell lines and their effects on ahr protein cyp1a1 protein and mrna cyp1b1 mrna and cell migration were determined2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin tcdd was used as a positive controlthe ahr agonist activities of the pharmaceuticals depended on structure response and cell contextmost compounds induced one or more ahrmediated responses in bt474 cells whereas in ahresponsive mdamb468 cells effects of the ahractive pharmaceuticals were highly variable4hydroxytamoxifen mexiletine and tranilast did not induce cyp1a1 in mdamb468 cells moreover in combination with tcdd mexiletine was a potent ahr antagonist tranilast was a partial antagonist and 4hydroxytamoxifen also exhibited some ahr antagonist activityomeprazole and to a lesser extent sulindac and leflunomide were full and partial ahr agonists respectively in both breast cancer cell linesthese data indicate that the ahractive pharmaceuticals are selective ahr modulators and applications of these drugs for targeting the ahr must be confirmed by studies using the most relevant cell context
