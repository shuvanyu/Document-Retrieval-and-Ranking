although soy phytoestrogens have been postulated to exert a protective effect against breast cancer the attendant mechanisms in particular epigenetics underpinnings have remained elusivewe investigated the putative effects on dna methylation by two naturally occurring isoflavones genistein and daidzein in a study of the brca1 and brca2 oncosuppressor genes in breast cancer cell lines mcf7 mdamb 231 and mcf10aa demethylant agent the 5azacytidine and a methylant the budesonide were used as treatment controlsdna methylation of brca1 and brca2 was investigated with methylated dna immunoprecipitation coupled with pcrin parallel protein expression was determined by western blot immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopyour results suggest that treatment with 185 μm genistein or 785 μm daidzein might reverse dna hypermethylation and restore the expression of the oncosuppressor genes brca1 and brca25azacitydine also enhanced the reexpression of these genes while budesonide had an opposite effectto the best of our knowledge these observations while requiring replication provide new evidence on potential epigenetic mechanisms by which genistein and daidzein might contribute to regulation of the brca1 and brca2future studies are warranted on whether the demethylating effect of genistein and daidzein is global or focused on select candidate genes
