the objective of this study was to determine the influence of frequent and longterm consumption of legume seeds on colonic functiontwo groups of subjects were studiedone group habitually consumed legume seeds as part of their normal diet a second group only infrequently consumed legumesno differences between these groups could be detected for fecal output and frequency intestinal transit time vfa excretion or fecal ph during 23day study periods in which subjects consumed either their usual diet or 100 g red kidney beans dailyhowever the addition of beans to the diets of both groups provided significantly more dietary fiber and produced greater fecal output and a higher concentration of vfa in fecesfecal output appeared to be determined by two independent parametersdietary fiber intake and vfa excretionbeans provided a physiologically useful source of dietary fiber and favorably influenced colonic function
