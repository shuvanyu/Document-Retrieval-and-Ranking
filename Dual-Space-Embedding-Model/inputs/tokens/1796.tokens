the opiate alkaloids present in poppy seed intended for use in food recently have raised major concernsan efficient method for routine analysis of morphine and codeine using liquid chromatography in combination with tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole instrument lcmsms was therefore developedthe optimal sample preparation was found to be cold extraction of 10 g of unground poppy seed with 30 ml of methanol containing 01 acetic acid for 60 min shaken at 250 rpmthe fate of morphine during food processing was also studiedall experiments led to a significant reduction of morphine and codeinefor poppy cake only 1650 of the morphine was recovered and in poppy buns at the highest temperature 220 degrees c only 3 of the original morphine content was foundground poppy seed showed significantly lower recoveries than untreated seedmorphine elimination during food processing has to be taken into account in the current discussion about its maximum limits in poppy seed
