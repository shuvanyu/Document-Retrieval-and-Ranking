seeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as fooddue to contamination during harvesting the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloidsthe objective of this study is to review the toxicology of poppy seed foods regarding influence on opiate drug testscomputerassisted literature review resulted in 95 identified referencesnormal poppy seed consumption is generally regarded as safeduring food processing the morphine content is considerably reduced up to 90the possibility of falsepositive opiate drug tests after poppy food ingestion existsthere are no unambiguous markers available to differentiate poppy food ingestion from heroin or pharmaceutical morphine usethis is also a problem in heroinassisted maintenance programsa basic requirement in such substitution programs is the patients abstinence from any other drugs including additional illicit heroinalso a lack of forensic ingestion trials was detected that consider all factors influencing the morphine content in biologic matrices after consumptionmost studies did not control for the losses during food processing so that the initial morphine dosage was overestimatedthe large reduction of the morphine content during past years raises questions about the validity of the poppy seed defencehowever a threshold of food use that would not lead to positive drug tests with certainty is currently unavailableresearch is needed to prove if the morphine contents in todays foods still pose the possibility of influencing drug testsfuture trials should consider processingrelated morphine losses
