we examined the resting metabolic rate rmr and sympathetic nervous system activity of young male vegetarians n  17 and nonvegetarians n  40subjects were characterized for rmr by indirect calorimetry norepinephrine kinetics from infusions of tritiated norepinephrine energy and macronutrient intake from a 3day food diary and body composition by underwater weighingvegetarians reported a greater relative intake of carbohydrates 62  5 v 51  6 p  01 and a lower relative intake of fat 25  5 v 33  6 p  01 than nonvegetarians whereas no differences were observed in daily energy intake body composition or maximal aerobic capacity vo2max between groupsvegetarians exhibited an 11 higher absolute rmr 129  015 v 116  013 kcalmin p  01 a higher plasma concentration of norepinephrine 216  33 v 165  18 pgml p  01 and a greater norepinephrine appearance rate 050  008 v 036  009 microgramsmin p  01 than nonvegetariansafter statistically controlling for differences in relative amounts of carbohydrate and fat in the diet and for norepinephrine concentrations no significant differences in adjusted rmr between vegetarians and nonvegetarians were notedthese results suggest that the higher rmr observed in young male vegetarians is partially mediated by differences in dietary macronutrient composition and increased sympathetic nervous system activity
