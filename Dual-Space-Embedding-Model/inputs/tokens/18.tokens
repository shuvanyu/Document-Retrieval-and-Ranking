aim of the study the roselle hibiscus sabdariffa was investigated for its uricosuric effectmaterials and methods a human model with nine subjects with no history of renal stones nonrenal stone ns and nine with a history of renal stones rs was used in this studya cup of tea made from 15 g of dry roselle calyces was provided to subjects twice daily morning and evening for 15 daysa clotted blood and two consecutive 24h urine samples were collected from each subject three times 1 at baseline control 2 on days 14 and 15 during the tea drinking period and 3 15 days after the tea drinking was stopped washoutserum and 24h urinary samples were analyzed for uric acid and other chemical compositions related to urinary stone risk factorsresults all analyzed serum parameters were within normal ranges and similar between the two groups of subjects and among the three periodsvis√†vis the urinary parameters most of the baseline values for both groups were similarafter taking the tea the trend was an increase in oxalate and citrate in both groups and uric acid excretion and clearance in the ns groupin the rs group both uric acid excretion and clearance were significantly increased p001when the fractional excretion of uric acid feua was calculated the values were clearly increased in both the ns and sf groups after the intake of tea and returned to baseline values in the washout periodthese changes were more clearly observed when the data for each subject was presented individuallyconclusions our data demonstrate a uricosuric effect of roselle calycessince the various chemical constituents in roselle calyces have been identified the ones exerting this uricosuric effect need to be identified
