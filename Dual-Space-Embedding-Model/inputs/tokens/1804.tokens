anecdotal survey and epidemiological data suggest that endurance athletes are at an increased risk for upper respiratory tract infection urti during periods of heavy training and the 1  to 2wk period after race eventsthe majority of athletes however who participate in endurance race events do not experience illnessof greater public health importance is the consistent finding of a reduction in urti risk reported by fitness enthusiasts and athletes who engage in regular exercise training while avoiding overreachingovertrainingalthough it naturally follows that infection risk should in some way be linked to acute and chronic exerciseinduced alterations in immunity attempts thus far to measure this association have been unsuccessfulthere is growing evidence that for several hours subsequent to heavy exertion several components of both the innate and adaptive immune system exhibit suppressed functionthe immune response to heavy exertion is transient however and further research on the mechanisms underlying the immune response to prolonged and intensive endurance exercise is necessary before meaningful clinical applications can be drawnsome attempts have been made through chemical or nutritional means eg indomethacin glutamine vitamin c and carbohydrate supplementation to attenuate immune changes after intensive exercise to lower the risk of infectionno consistent relationship between nutritional interventions exercise immunology and alteration in urti risk has yet been established
