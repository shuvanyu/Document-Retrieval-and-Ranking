intense exercise is directly related to muscular damage and oxidative stress due to excessive reactive oxygen species ros in both plasma and white blood cellsnevertheless exercisederived ros are essential to regulate cellular adaptation to exercisestudies on antioxidant supplements have provided controversial resultsthe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of moderate antioxidant supplementation lemon verbena extract in healthy male volunteers that followed a 90min running eccentric exercise protocol for 21 daysantioxidant enzymes activities and oxidative stress markers were measured in neutrophilsbesides inflammatory cytokines and muscular damage were determined in whole blood and serum samples respectivelyintense running exercise for 21 days induced antioxidant response in neutrophils of trained male through the increase of the antioxidant enzymes catalase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductasesupplementation with moderate levels of an antioxidant lemon verbena extract did not block this cellular adaptive response and also reduced exerciseinduced oxidative damage of proteins and lipids in neutrophils and decreased myeloperoxidase activitymoreover lemon verbena supplementation maintained or decreased the level of serum transaminases activity indicating a protection of muscular tissueexercise induced a decrease of interleukin6 and interleukin1Î² levels after 21 days measured in basal conditions which was not inhibited by antioxidant supplementationtherefore moderate antioxidant supplementation with lemon verbena extract protects neutrophils against oxidative damage decreases the signs of muscular damage in chronic running exercise without blocking the cellular adaptation to exercise
