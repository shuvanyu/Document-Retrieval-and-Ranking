exercise promotes longevity and ameliorates type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistancehowever exercise also increases mitochondrial formation of presumably harmful reactive oxygen species rosantioxidants are widely used as supplements but whether they affect the healthpromoting effects of exercise is unknownwe evaluated the effects of a combination of vitamin c 1000 mgday and vitamin e 400 iuday on insulin sensitivity as measured by glucose infusion rates gir during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in previously untrained n  19 and pretrained n  20 healthy young menbefore and after a 4 week intervention of physical exercise gir was determined and muscle biopsies for gene expression analyses as well as plasma samples were obtained to compare changes over baseline and potential influences of vitamins on exercise effectsexercise increased parameters of insulin sensitivity gir and plasma adiponectin only in the absence of antioxidants in both previously untrained p  0001 and pretrained p  0001 individualsthis was paralleled by increased expression of rossensitive transcriptional regulators of insulin sensitivity and ros defense capacity peroxisomeproliferatoractivated receptor gamma pparγ and pparγ coactivators pgc1α and pgc1β only in the absence of antioxidants p  0001 for allmolecular mediators of endogenous ros defense superoxide dismutases 1 and 2 glutathione peroxidase were also induced by exercise and this effect too was blocked by antioxidant supplementationconsistent with the concept of mitohormesis exerciseinduced oxidative stress ameliorates insulin resistance and causes an adaptive response promoting endogenous antioxidant defense capacitysupplementation with antioxidants may preclude these healthpromoting effects of exercise in humans
