background few studies have focused on the cognitive morbidity of neurocysticercosis ncc one of the most common parasitic infections of the central nervous systemwe longitudinally assessed the cognitive status and quality of life qol of patients with incident symptomatic ncc cases and matched controlsmethodologyprincipal findings the setting of the study was the sabogal hospital and cysticercosis unit department of transmissible diseases national institute of neurological sciences lima peruthe design was a longitudinal study of new onset ncc cases and controlsparticipants included a total of 14 patients with recently diagnosed ncc along with 14 healthy neighborhood controls and 7 recently diagnosed epilepsy controlsa standardized neuropsychological battery was performed at baseline and at 6 months on ncc cases and controlsa brain mri was performed in patients with ncc at baseline and 6 monthsneuropsychological results were compared between ncc cases and controls at both time pointsat baseline patients with ncc had lower scores on attention tasks p004 compared with epilepsy controls but no significant differences compared to healthy controlssix months after receiving antiparasitic treatment the ncc group significantly improved on tasks involving psychomotor speed p002qol at baseline suggested impaired mental function and social function in both the ncc and epilepsy group compared with healthy controlsqol gains in social function p  0006 were noted at 6 months in patients with nccconclusionssignificance newly diagnosed patients with ncc in this sample had mild cognitive deficits and more marked decreases in quality of life at baseline compared with controlsimprovements were found in both cognitive status and quality of life in patients with ncc after treatmentauthor summary neurocysticercosis ncc is one of the most common parasitic infections of the central nervous systemcognitive changes have been frequently reported with this disease but have not been well studiedour study team recruited a group of new onset ncc cases and a matched set of healthy neighborhood controls and new onset epilepsy controls in lima peru for this studya neuropsychological battery was administered at baseline and at 6 months to all groupsbrain mri studies were also obtained on ncc cases at baseline and at 6 monthsnewly diagnosed patients with ncc had mild cognitive deficits and more marked decreases in quality of life at baseline compared with controlsimprovements were found in both cognitive status and quality of life in patients with ncc after treatmentthis study is the first to assess cognitive status and quality of life longitudinally in patients with ncc and provides new data on an important clinical morbidity outcome
