to assess the burden of neurocysticercosis ncc in california we examined statewide hospital discharge data for 2009there were 304 cases hospitalized with ncc identified incidence  08 per 100000cases were mostly latino 849 slightly more likely to be male than female men 576 women 424 with an average age of 435 yearsa majority of cases were hospitalized in southern california 721 and many were hospitalized in los angeles county 447men were more likely than women to have severe disease including hydrocephalus 297 vs 186 p  0027 resulting in longer hospitalizations 4 days 480 vs 326 p  0007 that were more costly charge40 thousand men  469 vs woman  41 p  0026six deaths were recorded 20the total of nccrelated hospital charges exceeded 17 million estimated hospital costs exceeded 5 millionneurocysticercosis causes appreciable disease and exacts a considerable economic burden in californiaauthor summary neurocysticercosis ncc is considered one of the major neglected infections of poverty in the united states with mortality studies indicating that california bears the highest burden of this diseasealthough ncc is a reportable disease in california studies indicate that this disease goes largely underreported contributing to the lack of information about the disease distribution and burdenin this manuscript we reviewed the distribution of ncc hospitalizations in california demographics of those hospitalized and total hospitalrelated charges for 2009this study revealed that a majority of persons hospitalized with ncc in california receive their medical service in southern california hospitals primarily in the county of los angelesas compared to women hospitalized for this disease men had a longer and more costly hospitalization with more severe symptoms such as hydrocephalus a diagnosis suggestive of extraparenchymal infectionthe reasons for this difference in ncc severity by gender are not clear but do not appear to be due to delay in seeking medical care or a language barrierthe intensity of hospital care needed to manage these cases and the sizable ncc hospitalization charge underscores the considerable economic burden this disease presents in california
