background multiple myeloma mm is a b cell neoplasm causing lytic or osteopenic bone abnormalitieswhole body skeletal survey wbss magnetic resonance mr and 18ffdg petct are imaging techniques routinely used for the evaluation of bone involvement in mm patientsaim as mm bone lesions may present low 18ffdg uptake the aim of this study was to assess the possible added value and limitations of 11ccholine to that of 18ffdg petct in patients affected with mmmethods ten patients affected with mm underwent a standard 11ccholine petct and an 18ffdg petct within one weekthe results of the two scans were compared in terms of number sites and suvmax of lesionsresults four patients 40 had a negative concordant 11ccholine and 18ffdg petct scanstwo patients 20 had a positive 11ccholine and 18ffdg petct scans that identified the same number and sites of bone lesionsthe remaining four patients 40 had a positive 11ccholine and 18ffdg petct scan but the two exams identified different number of lesionscholine showed a mean suvmax of 5 while fdg showed a mean suvmax of 38 p  0042overall 11ccholine petct scans detected 37 bone lesions and 18ffdg petct scans detected 22 bone lesions but the difference was not significant p  08conclusion according to these preliminary data 11ccholine petct appears to be more sensitive than 18ffdg petct for the detection of bony myelomatous lesionsif these data are confirmed in larger series of patients 11ccholine may be considered a more appropriate functional imaging in association with mri for mm bone staging
