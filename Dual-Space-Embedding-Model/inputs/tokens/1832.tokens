it has been well established that complex mixtures of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables can be beneficial for human healthmoreover it is becoming increasingly apparent that phytochemicals can influence the pharmacological activity of drugs by modifying their absorption characteristics through interactions with drug transporters as well as drugmetabolizing enzyme systemssuch effects are more likely to occur in the intestine and liver where high concentrations of phytochemicals may occuralterations in cytochrome p450 and other enzyme activities may influence the fate of drugs subject to extensive firstpass metabolismalthough numerous studies of nutrientdrug interactions have been published and systematic reviews and metaanalyses of these studies are available no generalizations on the effect of nutrientdrug interactions on drug bioavailability are currently availableseveral publications have highlighted the unintended consequences of the combined use of nutrients and drugsmany phytochemicals have been shown to have pharmacokinetic interactions with drugsthe present review is limited to commonly consumed fruits and vegetables with significant beneficial effects as nutrients and components in folk medicinehere we discuss the phytochemistry and pharmacokinetic interactions of the following fruit and vegetables grapefruit orange tangerine grapes cranberry pomegranate mango guava black raspberry black mulberry apple broccoli cauliflower watercress spinach tomato carrot and avocadowe conclude that our knowledge of the potential risk of nutrientdrug interactions is still limitedtherefore efforts to elucidate potential risks resulting from fooddrug interactions should be intensified in order to prevent undesired and harmful clinical consequences 2011 institute of food technologists
