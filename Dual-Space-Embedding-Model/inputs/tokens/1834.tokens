background reducing dietary energy density has proven to be an effective strategy to reduce energy intakes and promote weight controlthis effect appears most robust when a low energy dense preload is consumed before mealsyet much discussion continues regarding the optimal form of a preloadthe purpose of the present study was to compare effects of a solid grapefruit liquid grapefruit juice and water preload consumed prior to breakfast lunch and dinner in the context of caloric restrictionmethods eightyfive obese adults bmi 30399 were randomly assigned to 127 g grapefruit gf grapefruit juice gfj or water preload for 12 weeks after completing a 2week caloric restriction phasepreloads were matched for weight calories water content and energy densityweekly measures included blood pressure weight anthropometry and 24hour dietary intakesresting energy expenditure body composition physical performance and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers were assessedresults the total amount grams of food consumed did not change over timeyet after preloads were combined with caloric restriction average dietary energy density and total energy intakes decreased by 2029 from baseline valuessubjects experienced 71 weight loss overall with significant decreases in percentage body trunk android and gynoid fat as well as waist circumferences 45 cmhowever differences were not statistically significant among groupsnevertheless the amount and direction of change in serum hdlcholesterol levels in gf 62 and gfj 82 preload groups was significantly greater than water preload group 37conclusions these data indicate that incorporating consumption of a low energy dense dietary preload in a caloric restricted diet is a highly effective weight loss strategybut the form of the preload did not have differential effects on energy balance weight loss or body compositionit is notable that subjects in gf and gfj preload groups experienced significantly greater benefits in lipid profilestrial registration clinicaltrialsgov nct00581074
