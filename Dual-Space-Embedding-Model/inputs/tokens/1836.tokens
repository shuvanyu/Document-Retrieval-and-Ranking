the contents of the bioactive compounds in red and blond grapefruits and their influence on humans suffering from hypertriglyceridemia were studiedit was found that red grapefruit has a higher content of bioactive compounds and a higher antioxidant potential than blond grapefruit determined by oxygen radical scavenging capacity 11diphenyl2picrylhydrazyl carotenoid bleaching and folinciocalteu assaysfiftyseven hyperlipidemic patients ages 3972 years after coronary bypass surgery recruited from the institutes pool of volunteers were randomly divided into three equal in number 19 groups two experimental red and blond groups and one control group cgduring 30 consecutive days of the investigation the diets of the patients of the red and blond dietary groups were daily supplemented with one equal in weight fresh red or blond grapefruit respectivelybefore and after this trial serum lipid levels of all fractions and serum antioxidant activity were determinedit was found that serum lipid levels in patients of the red and blond groups versus the cg after treatment were decreased a total cholesterol 669 versus 792 mmoll 155 and 732 versus 792 mmoll 76 respectively b lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol 501 versus 629 mmoll 203 and 562 versus 629 mmoll 107 respectively c triglycerides 169 versus 232 mmoll 172 and 219 versus 232 mmoll 56 respectivelyno changes in the serum lipid levels in patients of the cg were foundin conclusion fresh red grapefruit contains higher quantities of bioactive compounds and has significantly higher antioxidant potential than blond grapefruitdiet supplemented with fresh red grapefruit positively influences serum lipid levels of all fractions especially serum triglycerides and also serum antioxidant activitythe addition of fresh red grapefruit to generally accepted diets could be beneficial for hyperlipidemic especially hypertriglyceridemic patients suffering from coronary atherosclerosis
