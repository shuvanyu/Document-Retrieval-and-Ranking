to study the effects of grapefruit and grapefruit products on body weight and metabolic syndrome 91 obese patients were randomized to either placebo capsules and 7 ounces 207 ml of apple juice grapefruit capsules with 7 ounces 207 ml of apple juice 8 ounces 237 ml of grapefruit juice with placebo capsule or half of a fresh grapefruit with a placebo capsule three times a day before each mealmetabolic syndrome parameters were measured at the beginning and end of 12 weeksafter 12 weeks the fresh grapefruit group had lost 16 kg the grapefruit juice group had lost 15 kg the grapefruit capsule group had lost 11 kg and the placebo group had lost 03 kgthe fresh grapefruit group lost significantly more weight than the placebo group p  05a secondary analysis of those with the metabolic syndrome in the four treatment groups demonstrated a significantly greater weight loss in the grapefruit grapefruit capsule and grapefruit juice groups compared with placebo p  02there was also a significant reduction in 2hour postglucose insulin level in the grapefruit group compared with placebohalf of a fresh grapefruit eaten before meals was associated with significant weight lossin metabolic syndrome patients the effect was also seen with grapefruit productsinsulin resistance was improved with fresh grapefruitalthough the mechanism of this weight loss is unknown it would appear reasonable to include grapefruit in a weight reduction diet
