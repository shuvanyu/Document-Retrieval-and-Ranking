this study evaluated the effect of adding fruit or oats to the diet of freeliving women on energy consumption and body weightfruit and oat cookies had the same amount of fiber and total calories  approximately 200 kcal but differed in energy densitywe analyzed data from a clinical trial conducted in a primary care unit in rio de janeiro brazilfortynine women ages ranging from 30 to 50 years with body mass index bmi25 kgm2 were randomly chosen to add three apples 063 kcalg energy density or three pears 064 kcalg energy density or three oat cookies 37 kcalg energy density to their usual diet for 10 weeksfiber composition was similar  approximately 6gstatistical analysis of the repeated measures of dietary composition and body weight were analyzed using mixed model proceduresresults showed a significant decrease in the energy density during the followup 123 kcalg p004 and 129 kcalg p005 for apples and pears respectively compared to the oat groupthe energy intake also decreased significantly 2505 and 1966 kcalday for the apple and pear group respectively but showed a small increase 093 for the oat groupapples and pears were also associated p0001 with weight reduction 093 kg for the apple and 084 for the pear group whereas weight was unchanged 021 p035 in the oat groupresults suggest that energy densities of fruits independent of their fiber amount can reduce energy consumption and body weight over time
