folklore has suggested that consuming grapefruit may promote weight controlsparse data exist to support this hypothesis although there is some evidence of health promotion effects with regard to blood pressure control and modulation of circulating lipidsthe aim of this randomized controlled trial was to prospectively evaluate the role of grapefruit in reducing body weight and blood pressure and in promoting improvements in the lipid profile in overweight adults n  74following a 3week washout diet low in bioactiverich fruits and vegetables participants were randomized to either the control diet n  32 or daily grapefruit n  42 in the amount of one half of a fresh riored grapefruit with each meal 3 daily for 6 weeksno differences between group in weight blood pressure or lipids were demonstratedgrapefruit consumption was associated with modest weight loss 061  223 kg p  097 a significant reduction in waist circumference 245  060 cm p  0002 and a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure 321  1013 mm hg p  03 compared with baseline valuesimprovements were observed in circulating lipids of those consuming grapefruit with total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein significantly decreasing by 117 mgdl p  002 and 187 mgdl p  001 respectively compared with baseline valuesthis study suggests that consumption of grapefruit daily for 6 weeks does not significantly decrease body weight lipids or blood pressure as compared with the control conditionhowever the improvements in blood pressure and lipids demonstrated in the intervention group suggest that grapefruit should be further evaluated in the context of obesity and cardiovascular disease preventioncopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
