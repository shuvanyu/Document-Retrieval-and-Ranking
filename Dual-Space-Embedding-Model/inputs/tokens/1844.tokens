the average american diet which is high in protein and low in fruits and vegetables generates a large amount of acid mainly as sulfates and phosphatesthe kidneys respond to this dietary acid challenge with net acid excretion as well as ammonium and titratable acid excretionconcurrently the skeleton supplies buffer by active resorption of boneindeed calciuria is directly related to net acid excretiondifferent food proteins differ greatly in their potential acid load and therefore in their acidogenic effecta diet high in acidash proteins causes excessive calcium loss because of its acidogenic contentthe addition of exogenous buffers as chemical salts or as fruits and vegetables to a high protein diet results in a less acid urine a reduction in net acid excretion reduced ammonium and titratable acid excretion and decreased calciuriabone resorption may be halted and bone accretion may actually occuralkali buffers whether chemical salts or dietary fruits and vegetables high in potassium reverse acidinduced obligatory urinary calcium losswe conclude that excessive dietary protein from foods with high potential renal acid load adversely affects bone unless buffered by the consumption of alkalirich foods or supplements
