increasing dietary protein results in an increase in urinary calciumdespite over 80 y of research the source of the additional urinary calcium remains unclearbecause most calcium balance studies found little effect of dietary protein on intestinal calcium absorption it was assumed that the skeleton was the source of the calciumthe hypothesis was that the high endogenous acid load generated by a proteinrich diet would increase bone resorption and skeletal fracturehowever there are no definitive nutrition intervention studies that show a detrimental effect of a high protein diet on the skeleton and the hypothesis remains unprovenrecent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that dietary protein affects intestinal calcium absorptionwe conducted a series of shortterm nutrition intervention trials in healthy adults where dietary protein was adjusted to either low medium or highthe highest protein diet resulted in hypercalciuria with no change in serum parathyroid hormonesurprisingly within 4 d the low protein diet induced secondary hyperparathyroidism that persisted for 2 wkthe secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by the low protein diet was attributed to a reduction in intestinal calcium absorption as assessed by dual stable calcium isotopesthe longterm consequences of these low proteininduced changes in calcium metabolism are not known but they could be detrimental to skeletal healthseveral recent epidemiological studies demonstrate reduced bone density and increased rates of bone loss in individuals habitually consuming low protein dietstherefore studies are needed to determine whether low protein intakes directly affect rates of bone resorption bone formation or both
