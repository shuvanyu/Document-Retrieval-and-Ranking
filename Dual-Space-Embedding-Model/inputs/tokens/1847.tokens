background maintaining muscle mass while aging is important to prevent falls and fracturesmetabolic acidosis promotes muscle wasting and the net acid load from diets that are rich in net acidproducing protein and cereal grains relative to their content of net alkaliproducing fruit and vegetables may therefore contribute to a reduction in lean tissue mass in older adultsobjective we aimed to determine whether there was an association of 24h urinary potassium and an index of fruit and vegetable content of the diet with the percentage lean body mass lbm or change in lbm in older subjectsdesign subjects were 384 men and women 65 y old who participated in a 3y trial comparing calcium and vitamin d with placebopotassium was measured in 24h urine collections at baselinethe lbm defined as total body nonfat nonbone tissue weight  weight  100 was measured by using dualenergy xray absorptiometry at baseline and at 3 yphysical activity height and weight were assessed at baseline and at 3 yresults at baseline the mean urinary potassium excretion was 670  211 mmoldurinary potassium mmold was significantly positively associated with lbm at baseline Î²  0033 p  0006 adjusted for sex weight and nitrogen excretion but not with 3y change in lbmover the 3y study lbm increased by 26  36conclusion higher intake of foods rich in potassium such as fruit and vegetables may favor the preservation of muscle mass in older men and women
