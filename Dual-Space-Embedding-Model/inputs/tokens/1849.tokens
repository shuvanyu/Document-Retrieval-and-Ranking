context and objective dietary intake of animal proteins is associated with an increase in urinary calcium and nephrolithiasis riskwe tested the hypothesis that the acid load imposed by dietary proteins causes this hypercalciuriadesign and setting in a shortterm crossover metabolic study an alkali salt was provided with a highprotein diet hpd to neutralize the acid load imparted by dietary proteinsparticipants and interventions eleven healthy volunteers were evaluated at the end of each of four phases while consuming metabolic diets with fixed calcium and sodium contentphases 1 and 3 consisted of a control diet cdphases 2 and 4 consisted of a eucaloric hpd 60 gd animal proteins added to cdalong with hpd in phases 2 and 4 subjects ingested 30 meq twice daily of either potassium citrate kcitrate alkaline salt or potassium chloride kcl control neutral saltresults kcitrate completely neutralized the acid load imparted by hpd based on changes in urine ph and net acid excretion and increased urinary citrateurinary calcium increased during both hpd phases compared with cd but was not significantly different between the hpd  kcl and hpd  kcitrate phases 182  85 vs 170  85 mgd p  028increased urinary saturation with respect to calcium oxalate and uric acid with hpd was abrogated by kcitrateconclusions this study suggests that at least in the shortterm mechanisms other than acid load account for hypercalciuria induced by hpdthe beneficial effect of kcitrate on nephrolithiasis risk with hpd is through correction of declines in urine ph and citrate
