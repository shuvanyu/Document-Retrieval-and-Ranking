a precise understanding of the role of dietary protein in bone health has been evasive despite decades of researchit is known that a dietary acid load is harmful to bone and sulfurcontaining amino acids are metabolized to provide such an acid loadit is also known that protein elevates urine calcium losshowever recent clinical studies and a metaanalysis have indicated either no effect or a modest benefit associated with higher protein intakesthese contradictory considerations may be explained by the existence of a twofaced relationship between protein and bone with simultaneous positive and negative pathwaysin opposition to the negative effects of dietary acid load protein may exert positive effects related to improving calcium absorption increasing insulinlike growth factor 1 or improving lean body mass which in turn improves bone strengthputative mechanisms behind these pathways are reviewed here and some limitations in the historical literature as well as suggested measures to counter these in the future are identifiedwhen positive and negative pathways are considered in tandem protein may offer modest benefits to bone in the presence of adequate dietary calcium and acidneutralizing fruits and vegetables 2011 international life sciences institute
