highprotein hp diets exert a hypercalciuric effect at constant levels of calcium intake even though the effect may depend on the nature of the dietary proteinlower urinary ph is also consistently observed for subjects consuming hp dietsthe combination of these two effects was suspected to be associated with a dietary environment favorable for demineralization of the skeletonhowever increased calcium excretion due to hp diet does not seem to be linked to impaired calcium balancein contrast some data indicate that hp intakes induce an increase of intestinal calcium absorptionmoreover no clinical data support the hypothesis of a detrimental effect of hp diet on bone health except in a context of inadequate calcium supplyin addition hp intake promotes bone growth and retards bone loss and lowprotein diet is associated with higher risk of hip fracturesthe increase of acid and calcium excretion due to hp diet is also accused of constituting a favorable environment for kidney stones and renal diseaseshowever in healthy subjects no damaging effect of hp diets on kidney has been found in either observational or interventional studies and it seems that hp diets might be deleterious only in patients with preexisting metabolic renal dysfunctionthus hp diet does not seem to lead to calcium bone loss and the role of protein seems to be complex and probably dependent on other dietary factors and the presence of other nutrients in the diet
