our objective in this study was to determine the effects of a highprotein and highpotential renal acid load pral diet on calcium ca absorption and retention and markers of bone metabolismin a randomized crossover design 16 postmenopausal women consumed 2 diets 1 with low protein and low pral lplp total protein 61 gd pral 48 meqd and 1 with high protein and high pral hphp total protein 118 gd pral 33 meqd for 7 wk each separated by a 1wk breakca absorption was measured by whole body scintillation counting of radiolabeled 47cacompared with the lplp diet the hphp diet increased participants serum igfi concentrations p  00001 decreased serum intact pth concentrations p  0001 and increased fractional 47ca absorption mean  pooled sd 223 vs 265  54 p  005 and urinary ca excretion 156 vs 203  63 mgd p  0005the net difference between the amount of ca absorbed and excreted in urine did not differ between 2 diet periods 55 vs 28  51 mgdthe dietary treatments did not affect other markers of bone metabolismin summary a diet high in protein and pral increases the fractional absorption of dietary ca which partially compensates for increased urinary ca in postmenopausal womenthe increased igfi and decreased pth concentrations in serum with no change in biomarkers of bone resorption or formation indicate a highprotein diet has no adverse effects on bone health
