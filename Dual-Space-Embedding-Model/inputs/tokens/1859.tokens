the modern westerntype diet is deficient in fruits and vegetables and contains excessive animal products generating the accumulation of nonmetabolizable anions and a lifespan state of overlooked metabolic acidosis whose magnitude increases progressively with aging due to the physiological decline in kidney functionin response to this state of dietderived metabolic acidosis the kidney implements compensating mechanisms aimed to restore the acidbase balance such as the removal of the nonmetabolizable anions the conservation of citrate and the enhancement of kidney ammoniagenesis and urinary excretion of ammonium ionsthese adaptive processes lower the urine ph and induce an extensive change in urine composition including hypocitraturia hypercalciuria and nitrogen and phosphate wastinglow urine ph predisposes to uric acid stone formationhypocitraturia and hypercalciuria are risk factors for calcium stone diseaseeven a very mild degree of metabolic acidosis induces skeletal muscle resistance to the insulin action and dietary acid load may be an important variable in predicting the metabolic abnormalities and the cardiovascular risk of the general population the overweight and obese persons and other patient populations including diabetes and chronic kidney failurehigh dietary acid load is more likely to result in diabetes and systemic hypertension and may increase the cardiovascular riskresults of recent observational studies confirm an association between insulin resistance and metabolic acidosis markers including low serum bicarbonate high serum anion gap hypocitraturia and low urine phcopyright  2011 elsevier ltd and european society for clinical nutrition and metabolismall rights reserved
