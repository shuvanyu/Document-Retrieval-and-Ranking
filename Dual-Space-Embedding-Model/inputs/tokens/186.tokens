mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseaseshuman studies suggest that homocysteine hcy plays a role in brain damage cognitive and memory declinenumerous studies in recent years investigated the role of hcy as a cause of brain damagehcy itself or folate and vitamin b12 deficiency can cause disturbed methylation andor redox potentials thus promoting calcium influx amyloid and tau protein accumulation apoptosis and neuronal deaththe hcy effect may also be mediated by activating the nmethyldaspartate receptor subtypenumerous neurotoxic effects of hcy can be blocked by folate glutamate receptor antagonists or various antioxidantsthis review describes the most important mechanisms of hcy neurotoxicity and pharmacological agents known to reverse hcy effects
