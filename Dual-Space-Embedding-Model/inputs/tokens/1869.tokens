the purpose of this study was to determine whether a single ldl apheresis would improve impaired endotheliumdependent dilation of the coronary artery in patients with hypercholesterolemiahypercholesterolemia is associated with impaired endothelial function and human studies using cholesterollowering drugs indicate that endothelial function in the coronary arteries improves with reduction of serum ldl cholesterol over 6 to 12 monthsthe internal diameter of the left coronary artery and the coronary blood flow were measured by intracoronary dopplerwire measurement and quantitative angiography before and immediately after a single ldl apheresis in a population of 15 patients with familial hypercholesterolemiaendotheliumdependent vasodilation was assessed by intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine 1 10 and 50 microgmin and endotheliumindependent vasodilation was assessed by intracoronary bolus infusion of isosorbide dinitrate 25 mg or papaverine 10 mga single 3hour ldl apheresis reduced serum ldl cholesterol by an average of 866  17after the ldl apheresis the changes in the coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow in response to an infusion of 50 microgmin of acetylcholine increased significantly compared to the preapheresis values from 197  48 to 29  30 p  001 and from 807  276 to 1553  235 p  001 respectivelythe ldl apheresis did not significantly change the response of either parameter to infusion with isosorbide dinitrate or papaverinethe endothelial function of the epicardial coronary artery and the coronary microvasculature improved in hypercholesterolemic patients after only a single ldl apheresis a procedure that markedly reduces the serum level of ldl cholesterolcopyright 2004 wileyliss inc
