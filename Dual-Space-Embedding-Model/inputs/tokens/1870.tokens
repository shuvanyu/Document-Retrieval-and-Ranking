context interferon beta is widely prescribed to treat multiple sclerosis ms however its relationship with disability progression has yet to be establishedobjective to investigate the association between interferon beta exposure and disability progression in patients with relapsingremitting ms design setting and patients retrospective cohort study based on prospectively collected data 19852008 from british columbia canadapatients with relapsingremitting ms treated with interferon beta n  868 were compared with untreated contemporary n  829 and historical n  959 cohortsmain outcome measures the main outcome measure was time from interferon beta treatment eligibility baseline to a confirmed and sustained score of 6 requiring a cane to walk 100 m confirmed at 150 days with no measurable improvement on the expanded disability status scale edss range 010 with higher scores indicating higher disabilitya multivariable cox regression model with interferon beta treatment included as a timevarying covariate was used to assess the hazard of disease progression associated with interferon beta treatmentanalyses also included propensity score adjustment to address confounding by indicationresults the median active followup times first to last edss measurement were as follows for the interferon betatreated cohort 51 years interquartile range iqr 3070 years for the contemporary control cohort 40 years iqr 2164 years and for the historical control cohort 108 years iqr 63147 yearsthe observed outcome rates for reaching a sustained edss score of 6 were 108 53 and 231 in the 3 cohorts respectivelyafter adjustment for potential baseline confounders sex age disease duration and edss score exposure to interferon beta was not associated with a statistically significant difference in the hazard of reaching an edss score of 6 when either the contemporary control cohort hazard ratio 130 95 ci 092183 p  14 or the historical control cohort hazard ratio 077 95 ci 058102 p  07 were consideredfurther adjustment for comorbidities and socioeconomic status where possible did not change interpretations and propensity score adjustment did not substantially change the resultsconclusion among patients with relapsingremitting ms administration of interferon beta was not associated with a reduction in progression of disability
