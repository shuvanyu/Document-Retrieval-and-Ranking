background early childhood introduction of nutritional habits aimed at atherosclerosis prevention reduces childrens serum total cholesterol concentration but its effect on vascular endothelial function is unknownmethods and results between 1990 and 1992 we randomized healthy 7monthold infants n1062 to intervention lowsaturatedfat diet and control unrestricted diet groupsat the age of 11 years endotheliumdependent flowmediated and endotheliumindependent nitratemediated vasodilatory responses of the brachial artery were measured with highresolution ultrasound in 179 intervention and 190 control childrenthe effect of intervention on endothelial function was significant in boys p00034 but not in girls p069the maximum endotheliumdependent dilation response meansd was 962353 and 836385 in intervention boys and control boys and 884400 and 844360 in intervention girls and control girls respectivelyintervention had no effect on nitratemediated dilationthe difference in endothelial function in boys remained significant after adjustment for current serum total or ldl cholesterol but became nonsignificant after adjustment for mean cholesterol measured under 3 years of age adjusted means 946 ci 868 to 1024 versus 854 ci 775 to 932 p011conclusions a lowsaturatedfat diet introduced in infancy and maintained during the first decade of life is associated with enhanced endothelial function in boysthe effect is explained in part by the dietinduced reduction in serum cholesterol concentration
