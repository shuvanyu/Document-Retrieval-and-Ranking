most metastatic tumors such as those originating in the prostate lung and gastrointestinal tract respond poorly to conventional chemotherapynovel treatment strategies for advanced cancer are therefore desperately neededdietary restriction of the essential amino acid methionine offers promise as such a strategy either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or other treatmentsnumerous in vitro and animal studies demonstrate the effectiveness of dietary methionine restriction in inhibiting growth and eventually causing death of cancer cellsin contrast normal host tissues are relatively resistant to methionine restrictionthese preclinical observations led to a phase i clinical trial of dietary methionine restriction for adults with advanced cancerpreliminary findings from this trial indicate that dietary methionine restriction is safe and feasible for the treatment of patients with advanced cancerin addition the trial has yielded some preliminary evidence of antitumor activityone patient with hormoneindependent prostate cancer experienced a 25 reduction in serum prostatespecific antigen psa after 12 weeks on the diet and a second patient with renal cell cancer experienced an objective radiographic responsethe possibility that methionine restriction may act synergistically with other cancer treatments such as chemotherapy is being exploredfindings to date support further investigation of dietary methionine restriction as a novel treatment strategy for advanced cancer
