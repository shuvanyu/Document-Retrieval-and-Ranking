recent studies confirm that dietary methionine restriction increases both mean and maximal lifespan in rats and mice achieving aging retardant effects very similar to those of caloric restriction including a suppression of mitochondrial superoxide generationalthough voluntary caloric restriction is never likely to gain much popularity as a prolongevity strategy for humans it may be more feasible to achieve moderate methionine restriction in light of the fact that vegan diets tend to be relatively low in this amino acidplant proteins  especially those derived from legumes or nuts  tend to be lower in methionine than animal proteinsfurthermore the total protein content of vegan diets as a function of calorie content tends to be lower than that of omnivore diets and plant protein has somewhat lower bioavailability than animal proteinwholefood vegan diets that moderate bean and soy intake while including ample amounts of fruit and wine or beer can be quite low in methionine while supplying abundant nutrition for health assuming concurrent b12 supplementationfurthermore lowfat vegan diets coupled with exercise training can be expected to promote longevity by decreasing systemic levels of insulin and free igfi the latter effect would be amplified by methionine restriction  though it is not clear whether igfi downregulation is the sole basis for the impact of lowmethionine diets on longevity in rodents
