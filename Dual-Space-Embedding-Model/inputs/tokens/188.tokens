we investigated total free and proteinbound plasma homocysteine cysteine and cysteinylglycine in 13 subjects aged 2429 y after a breakfast at 0900 h containing 1518 g of protein and a dinner at 1500 h containing approximately 50 g of proteintwelve subjects had normal fasting homocysteine mean  sd 76  11 mumoll and methionine concentrations 227  35 mumoll and were included in the statistical analysesbreakfast caused a small but significant increase in plasma methionine 222  206 and a brief nonsignificant increase followed by a significant decline in free homocysteinehowever changes in total and bound homocysteine were smallafter dinner there was a marked increase in plasma methionine by 167  89 mumoll 879  49 which was associated with a rapid and marked increase in free homocysteine 337  196 4 h after dinner and a moderate and slow increase in total 135  75 8 h and proteinbound 126  94 8 h homocysteineafter both meals cysteine and cysteinylglycine concentrations seemed related to changes in homocysteine because there were parallel fluctuations in the freebound ratios of all three thiolsdietary changes in plasma homocysteine will probably not affect the evaluation of vitamin deficiency states associated with moderate to severe hyperhomocysteinemia but may be of concern in the risk assessment of cardiovascular disease in patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemiasynchronous fluctuations in the freebound ratio of the plasma aminothiol compounds indicate that biological effects of homocysteine may be difficult to separate from effects due to associated changes in other aminothiol compounds
