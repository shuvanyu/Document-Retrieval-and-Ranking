methionine dependence is a metabolic defect that occurs in many human tumor cell lines but not normal in unestablished cell strainsmethioninedependent tumor cell lines are unable to proliferate and arrest in the late sg2 phase of the cell cycle when methionine is replaced by its immediate precursor homocysteine in the culture medium methcy mediumhowever it is not known whether methionine dependence occurs in fresh patient tumors as it does in cell linesin order to determine whether methionine dependence occurs in fresh patient tumors as well as whether methionine dependence occurs in fresh patient tumors as well as in cell lines we took advantage of the technique of spongegelsupported histoculture to grow tumors directly from surgerywe then measured nuclear dna content by image analysis to determine the cell cycle position in methcy compared to methcy medium in 21 human patient tumorshuman tumor cell lines found to be methionine dependent by cell count were used as positive controls and were found to have marked reduction of cells in g1 compared to total cells in the cell cycle in methcy medium with respect to the g1 total cell ratio in methcy mediumtherefore late cell cycle arrest was used as a marker of methionine dependence for histocultured patient tumorswe found that 5 human tumors of 21 including tumors of the colon breast ovary prostate and a melanoma were methionine dependent based on cell cycle analysisthese data on fresh human tumors indicate that methionine dependence may frequently occur in the cancer patient populationimplications for potential therapy based on methionine dependence are discussed
