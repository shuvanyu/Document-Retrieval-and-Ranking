various pesticides are being used to destabilize perturb or inhibit crucial biochemical and physiological targets related to metabolism growth development nervous communication or behavior in pestiferous organismschitin is an eukaryotic extracellular aminosugar biopolymer massively produced by most fungal systems and by invertebrates notably arthropodsbeing an integral supportive component in fungal cell wall insect cuticle and nematode egg shell chitin has been considered as a selective target for pesticide actionthroughout the elaborate processes of chitin formation and deposition only the polymerization events associated with the cell membrane compartment are so far available for chemical interferencecurrently the actinomycetesderived nucleoside peptide fungicides such as the polyoxins and the insecticidal benzoylaryl ureas have reached commercial pesticide statusthe polyoxins and other structurallyrelated antibiotics like nikkomycins are strong competitive inhibitors of the polymerizing enzyme chitin synthasethe exact biochemical lesion inflicted by the benzoylaryl ureas is still elusive but a postpolymerization event such as translocation of chitin chains across the cell membrane is suggestedhydrolytic degradation of the chitin polymer is essential for hyphal growth branching and septum formation in fungal systems as well as for the normal molting of arthropodsrecently insect chitinase activity was strongly and specifically suppressed by allosamidin an actimomycetesderived metabolitein part the defense mechanism in plants against invasion of pathogens is associated with induced chitinaseschitin chitosan and their oligomers are able to act as elicitors which induce enhanced levels of chitinases in various plantslectins which bind to nacetyldglucosamine strongly interfere with fungal and insect chitin synthasesplant lectins with similar properties may be involved in plantpathogen interaction inter alia by suppressing fungal invasion
