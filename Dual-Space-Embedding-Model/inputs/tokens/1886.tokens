introduction amino acid auxotrophy or the metabolic defect which renders cancer incapable of surviving under amino acid depleted conditions is being exploited and explored as a therapeutic against cancerearly clinical data on asparagine and argininedepleting drugs have demonstrated low toxicity and efficacy in melanoma hepatocellular carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemiamethionine auxotrophy is a novel niche currently under exploration for targeting certain cancersareas covered in this review we explore the discovery of methionine auxotrophy followed by in vitro in vivo and patient data on targeting cancer with methionine depletionwe end with a small discussion on bioengineering pegylation and red blood cell encapsulation as mechanisms for decreasing immunogenicity of methioninedepleting drugswe hope to provide a platform for future pharmacology toxicology and cytotoxicity studies with methionine depletion therapy and drugsexpert opinion although methionine auxotrophy seems as a viable target extensive research addressing normal versus cancer cell toxicity needs to be conductedfurther research also needs to be conducted into the molecular mechanism associated with methionine depletion therapyfinally novel methods need to be developed to decrease the immunogenicity of methioninedepleting drugs a current issue with protein therapeutics
