alzheimers disease ad is the most common form of neurodegenerative diseasethe vast majority cases of ad are sporadic without clear cause and a combination of environmental and genetic factors have been implicatedthe hypothesis that homocysteine hcy is a risk factor for ad was initially prompted by the observation that patients with histologically confirmed ad had higher plasma levels of hcy also called hyperhomocysteinemia hhcy than agematched controlsmost evidence accumulated so far implicates hhcy as a risk factor for ad onset but conflicting results also existin this review we summarize reports on the relationship between hhcy and ad from epidemiological investigations including observational studies and randomized controlled clinical trialswe also examine recent in vivo and in vitro studies of potential mechanisms whereby hhcy may influence ad developmentfinally we discuss possible reasons for the existing conflicting data and provide suggestions for future studies
