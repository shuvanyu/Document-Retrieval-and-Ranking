the human apobec3g protein is an innate antiviral factor that can dominantly inhibit the replication of some endogenous and exogenous retrovirusesthe prospects of purposefully harnessing such an antiviral defense are under investigationhere longterm coculture experiments were used to show that porcine endogenous retrovirus perv transmission from pig to human cells is reduced to nearly undetectable levels by expressing human apobec3g in virusproducing pig kidney cellsinhibition occurred by a deaminationindependent mechanism likely after particle production but before the virus could immortalize by integration into human genomic dnaperv inhibition did not require the dna cytosine deaminase activity of apobec3g and correspondingly apobec3gattributable hypermutations were not detectedin contrast overexpression of the sole endogenous apobec3 protein of pigs failed to interfere significantly with perv transmissiontogether these data constitute the first proofofprinciple demonstration that apobec3 proteins can be used to fortify the innate antiviral defenses of cells to prevent the zoonotic transmission of an endogenous retrovirusthese studies suggest that human apobec3gtransgenic pigs will provide safer pervless xenotransplantation resources and that analogous crossspecies apobec3dependent restriction strategies may be useful for thwarting other endogenous as well as exogenous retrovirus infections
