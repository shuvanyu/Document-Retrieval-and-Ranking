elevated total plasma homocysteine has been linked to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in later life and this can be reliably lowered by the daily supplementation of vitamin b6 b12 and folic acidwe performed a systematic review and metaanalysis of 19 english language randomized placebocontrolled trials of homocysteine lowering bvitamin supplementation of individuals with and without cognitive impairment at the time of study entrywe standardized scores to facilitate comparison between studies and to enable us to complete a metaanalysis of randomized trialsin addition we stratified our analyses according to the folate status of the country of originbvitamin supplementation did not show an improvement in cognitive function for individuals with smd  010 95ci 008 to 028 or without smd  003 95ci 01 to 004 significant cognitive impairmentthis was irrespective of study duration smd  005 95ci 010 to 020 and smd  0 95ci 008 to 008 study size smd  005 95ci 009 to 019 and smd  002 95ci 010 to 005 and whether participants came from countries with low folate status smd  014 95ci 012 to 040 and smd  010 95ci 023 to 004supplementation of vitamins b12 b6 and folic acid alone or in combination does not appear to improve cognitive function in individuals with or without existing cognitive impairmentit remains to be established if prolonged treatment with bvitamins can reduce the risk of dementia in later life
