introduction asbestos is banned in most western countries but related malignancies are still of clinical concern because of their long latenciesthis review identifies and addresses some controversial occupational and clinical aspects of asbestosrelated malignanciesmethods papers published in english from 1980 to 2009 were retrieved from pubmeda total of 307 original articles were identified and 159 were includedassessment of exposure the retrospective assessment of exposure is usually performed by using questionnaires and job exposure matrices and by careful collection of medical historyin this way crucial information about manufacturing processes and specific jobs can be obtainedin addition fibers and asbestos bodies are counted in lung tissue bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum but different techniques and interlaboratory variability hamper the interpretation of reported measurementsscreening for malignancies the effectiveness of lowdose chest ct screening in exposed workers is debatableseveral biomarkers have also been considered to screen individuals at risk for lung cancer and mesothelioma but reliable signatures are still missingattribution of lung cancer exposures correlating with lung cancer are high and in the same range where asbestosis occurshowever the unresolved question is whether the presence of fibrosis is a requirement for the attribution of lung cancer to asbestosthe etiology of lung cancer is difficult to define in cases of lowlevel asbestos exposure and concurrent smoking habitsmesothelioma the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma may also be difficult because of procedures in sampling fixation and processing and uses of immunohistochemical probesconclusions assessment of exposure is crucial and requires accurate medical and occupational historiesquantitative analysis of asbestos body burden is better performed in digested lung tissues by counting asbestos bodies by light microscopy andor uncoated fibers by transmission electron microscopythe benefits of screenings for asbestosrelated malignancies are equivocalthe attribution of lung cancer to asbestos exposure is difficult in a clinical setting because of the need to assess asbestos body burden and the fact that virtually all these patients are also tobacco smokers or former smokersgiven the premise that asbestosis is necessary to causally link lung cancer to asbestos it follows that the assessment of both lung fibrosis and asbestos body burden is necessary
