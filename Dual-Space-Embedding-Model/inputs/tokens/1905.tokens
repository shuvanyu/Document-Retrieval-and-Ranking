background between november 2006 and may 2008 a subacute neurological syndrome affected workers from two swine abattoirs in minnesota and indiana who had occupational exposure to aerosolised porcine brainwe aimed to describe the pathogenic and immunological characteristics of this illnessmethods all patients from two abattoirs who presented or were referred to the mayo clinic rochester mn usa with neurological symptoms were includedwe recorded details of exposure to aerosolised brain tissue and did comprehensive neurological laboratory neuroimaging electrophysiological pathological and autoimmune serological assessmentshealthy controls were recruited from the community and from workers at the plant in minnesotafindings 24 patients were identified 21 from minnesota three from indianathe shortest duration from first exposure to symptom onset was 4 weeksno infectious agent that could trigger disease was identifiedall patients developed polyradiculoneuropathy which was usually sensory predominant and painfultwo patients had initial cns manifestations transverse myelitis and meningoencephalitisnerve conduction studies localised abnormalities to the most proximal and distal nerve segmentsquantitative sensory and autonomic testing revealed involvement of large and small sensory fibres and sweat fibresmri showed prominent abnormalities of roots and ganglianerve biopsies identified mild demyelination axonal degeneration and perivascular inflammationprotein concentrations were high in the csf of 18 86 of 21 patientssera from all patients and 29 34 of 85 unaffected workplace controls but none of 178 community controls had a distinctive neuralreactive igg 75 of patients sera contained an igg specific to myelin basic proteinseropositivity correlated directly with exposure risk in patients and controls17 patients required immunomodulatory therapies six improved spontaneously and one was lost to followup after exposure stoppedinterpretation the neurological disorder described is autoimmune in origin and is related to occupational exposure to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigensthe pattern of nerve involvement suggests vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the bloodnerve barrier is most permeablefunding mayo clinic foundation minnesota department of health centers for disease control and preventioncopyright 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
