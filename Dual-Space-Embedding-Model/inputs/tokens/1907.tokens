smoking is an established risk factor for pancreatic cancer however detailed examination of the association of smoking intensity smoking duration and cumulative smoking dose with pancreatic cancer is limitedthe authors analyzed pooled data from the international pancreatic cancer cohort consortium nested casecontrol study 1481 cases 1539 controlsodds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated by using unconditional logistic regressionsmoking intensity effects were examined with an excess odds ratio model that was linear in packyears and exponential in cigarettes smoked per day and its squarewhen compared with never smokers current smokers had a significantly elevated risk odds ratio or  177 95 confidence interval ci 138 226risk increased significantly with greater intensity 30 cigarettesday or  175 95 ci 127 242 duration 50 years or  213 95 ci 125 362 and cumulative smoking dose 40 packyears or  178 95 ci 135 234risk more than 15 years after smoking cessation was similar to that for never smokersestimates of excess odds ratio per packyear declined with increasing intensity suggesting greater risk for total exposure delivered at lower intensity for longer duration than for higher intensity for shorter durationthis finding and the decline in risk after smoking cessation suggest that smoking has a latestage effect on pancreatic carcinogenesis
