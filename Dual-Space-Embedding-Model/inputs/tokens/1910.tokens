avian leukosissarcoma viruses alsv infect and cause cancers in chickenspoultry workers are exposed to alsv and other infectious agents in the workplacethis study examines if industrial hygiene assessment of antibody levels in poultry workers can identify risky job tasks at the higher exposure risk to an infectious agent ie alsvwe compared alsv antibody levels in poultry workers and control subjectsoccupational and demographical factors were examined for an association with the exposure risk in poultry workerswe found that the antibody levels were significantly higher in poultry workers than in control subjectsjob category and age together were significantly associated with the antibody levels in workerscertain job tasks were identified with significantly higher antibody levels as compared to others implying that recommendations should be made to protect workers at these jobsthe findings of this study indicate that the measurement of antibody levels in workers can be useful for industrial hygiene assessment of exposure to infectious agents
