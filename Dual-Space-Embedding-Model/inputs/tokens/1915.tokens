skin blood perfusion and oxygenation depends upon cardiovascular hormonal and circulatory health in humans and provides sociosexual signals of underlying physiology dominance and reproductive status in some primateswe allowed participants to manipulate colour calibrated facial photographs along empiricallymeasured oxygenated and deoxygenated blood colour axes both separately and simultaneously to optimise healthy appearanceparticipants increased skin blood colour particularly oxygenated above basal levels to optimise healthy appearancewe show therefore that skin blood perfusion and oxygenation influence perceived health in a way that may be important to mate choice
