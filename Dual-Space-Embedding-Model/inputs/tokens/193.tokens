objectives elevated homocysteine has emerged as a risk factor for cognitive impairment even in healthy elderly personsreduced brain volume and white matter hyperintensities also occur in healthy elderly as well but the interrelationships between these have not been well studiedwe report these interrelationships in non demented relatively healthy communitydwelling older adults from a single east asian populationmethods two hundred twentyeight righthanded participants age 55 years and above were evaluatedpersons with medical conditions or neurological diseases other than wellcontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension were excludedparticipants underwent quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the brain using a standardized protocol and neuropsychological evaluationplasma homocysteine folate vitamin b12 and markers for cardiovascular risk blood pressure body mass index fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were measuredresults elevated homocysteine was associated with reduced global cerebral volume larger ventricles reduced cerebral white matter volume and lower cognitive performance in several domainselevated homocysteine was associated with reduced white matter volume β  2080 t  29 df  223 p  0004 and lower speed of processing β  038 t  21 df  223 p  003 even after controlling for age gender and educationhowever the association between homocysteine and lower speed of processing disappeared after controlling for white matter volumeelevated homocysteine was not associated with white matter hyperintensity volume or with hippocampal volumealthough homocysteine and folate levels were correlated their effects on white matter volume were dissociatedconclusion in non demented relatively healthy adults elevated homocysteine is associated with lower cognitive scores and reduced cerebral white matter volumethese effects can be dissociated from those related to white matter hyperintensities or reduced folate levelcopyright  2013 american association for geriatric psychiatrypublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
