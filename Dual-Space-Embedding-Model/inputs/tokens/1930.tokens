background and objective in 1981 a petrollead phaseout program plpop was launched in taiwan for the abatement of environmental lead emissionsthe present study was intended to examine whether the high petrollead emission areas plea would result in an increase in the incidence rate of brain cancer based on a national data bankmethods the national brain cancer incidence data was obtained from the taiwan national cancer registryage standardized incidence rates were calculated based on the 2000 who world standard population and gasoline consumption data was obtained from the bureau of energythe differences in the trend tests for agestandardized incidence rates of brain cancer between high median low and small plea were analyzedresults a significant increase was found from small to high plea in agestandardized incidence rates of brain cancerby taking six possible confounders into account the agestandardized incidence rates for brain cancer were highly correlated with the median and high plea by reference to the small pleaconclusion after being adjusted for a number of relevant confounders it could be concluded that high plea might result in an increase in the incidence rate of brain cancer resulting from high lead exposurescopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
