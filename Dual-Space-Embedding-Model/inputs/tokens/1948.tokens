the aim of this work is to assess the association between vasculogenic erectile dysfunction ed and coronary artery disease in men above the age of 40 ythe study included 40 patients above 40 y of age with vasculogenic ed of more than 3 months durationa dynamic duplex study after intracavernosal injection of a bimix solution 60 mg papaverine  2 mg phentolamine mesylate was carried out using a color ultrasound machinethe patients underwent a stress ecg test carried out on a motordriven treadmill according to the bruce protocola total of 12 patients were diagnosed with positive ischemic heart disease ihdtheir mean peak systolic velocity psv was psv  1958 cmsin all patients were diagnosed with negative ihd their mean psv was 3621 cmsa statistically significant difference was observed between patients with positive ihd and patients with negative ihd regarding psv p  0003the sensitivity of a psv of less than 35 cms in predicting ihd was 50 with a specificity of 100positive predictive value for abnormal stress ecg to predict a psv of less than 35 cms was 100in conclusion the psv of cavernosal arteries is a reliable measure for predicting ihd in patients with vasculogenic edpatients with a psv of less than 35 cms should be referred for cardiologic assessment as they carry a real risk of having silent ihd
