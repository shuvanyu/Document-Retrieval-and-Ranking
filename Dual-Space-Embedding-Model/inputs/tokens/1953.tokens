the purpose of this study is to investigate the possible underlying pathogenesis of erectile dysfunctioned in young men with low risk of coronary heart disease and no wellknown aetiologyto conduct this study 122 patients with ed under the age of 40 were enrolled along with 33 agematched normal control subjectsthe patients with ed had significantly higher levels of systolic blood pressure sbp total cholesterol and triglyceride high sensitivity creactive protein hscrp greater carotid intimamedia thickness cimt and framingham risk score frs than the control group though all of these values were within the respective normal rangefurther the brachial artery flow mediated vasodilation fmd values were significantly lower in ed patients and correlated positively with the severity of ed r  0714 p  0001when these significant factors were studied in the multivariate logistic regression model fmd sbp hscrp and frs remained the statistical significancethe receiveroperating characteristic roc analysis demonstrated that fmd had a high ability to predict ed in young male with low frs area under the curve auc 0921 p  0001the cutoff value of fmd 1025 had sensitivity of 828 and specificity of 100 for diagnosis of edfrs and hs crp were also proven to be predictors of ed auc 0812 p  0001 auc 0645 p  0011 respectivelythe results of this study validated that subclinical endothelial dysfunction and lowgrade inflammation may be the underlying pathogenesis of ed with no wellknown aetiologyyoung patients complaining of ed should be screened for cardiovascular risk factors and possible subclinical atherosclerosismeasurement of fmd hscrp and frs can improve our ability to predict and treat ed as well as subclinical cardiovascular disease early for young male 2012 the authorsinternational journal of andrology  2012 european academy of andrology
