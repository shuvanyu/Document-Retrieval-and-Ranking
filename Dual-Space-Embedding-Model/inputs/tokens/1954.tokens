objectives we examined whether common coronary heart disease chd risk factors measured in midlife predict erectile dysfunction ed 25 years laterbackground retrospective and crosssectional studies have suggested that ed is associated with classic chd risk factors but few prospective studies have studied these associationsmethods in this prospective study of communitydwelling men age 30 to 69 years seven classic chd risk factors age smoking hypertension diabetes hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia and obesity were assessed from 1972 to 1974in 1998 after an average followup of 25 years surviving male participants were asked to complete the international index of erectile function iief5 which allows stratification of ed into five groupsresults sixtyeight percent of the surviving men returned and 60 completed the iief5 questionnairerespondents had more favorable levels of all heart disease risk factors at baseline than nonrespondentsat baseline the average age of the 570 ed study participants was 46 years at followup their average age was 72 yearsmean age body mass index cholesterol and triglycerides were each significantly associated with an increased risk of edcigarette smoking was marginally more common in those with severecomplete ed as compared with those without edblood pressure and fasting blood glucose were not significantly associated with ed likely due to selective mortalityconclusions improving chd risk factors in midlife may decrease the risk of ed as well as chderectile dysfunction should be included as an outcome in clinical trials of lipidlowering agents and lifestyle modifications
