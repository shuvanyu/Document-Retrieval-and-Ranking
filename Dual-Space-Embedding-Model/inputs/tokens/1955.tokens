objectives the purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence and extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients with vascular erectile dysfunction edbackground an association between ed and ischemic heart disease has been suggested but it is unknown if it represents a marker of subclinical coronary atherosclerosismethods we studied 70 consecutive patients with vascular ed evaluated by penile doppler and 73 control subjects with no history of coronary artery diseasewe measured traditional coronary risk factors circulating levels of creactive protein crp endothelial function by ultrasound of brachial artery and coronary artery calcification by multislice computed tomographyresults the patients and the control group were similar for age race and coronary risk scorepatients with ed had significantly higher highsensitivity creactive protein levels 262 vs 103 mgl p  0001flowmediated dilation of the brachial artery was more impaired in patients with ed than in controls 236 vs 392 p  0001coronary artery calcification was more frequent in individuals with ed than in control subjects p  001multiple logistic regression analysis showed that patients with ed had an overall odds ratio of 368 for having calcium score above the 75th percentile compared to the controlsconclusions coronary atherosclerosis is more severe in patients with vascular ed ed predicts the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseasethus ed may be considered an additional early warning sign of coronary atherosclerosis
