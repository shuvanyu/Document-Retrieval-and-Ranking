objectives the aim of this study was to assess erectile dysfunction prevalence time of onset and association with risk factors in patients with acute chest pain and angiographically documented coronary artery diseasemethods 300 consecutive patients with acute chest pain and angiographically documented coronary artery disease were assessed using a semistructured interview investigating their medical and sexual histories the international index of erectile function and other instrumentsresults patient mean age was 6258 years range 3386 yearsmean duration of symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia prior to enrollment in the study was 49 months range 1200coronary angiography showed 1 2 and 3vessel disease in 98 326 88 293 and 114 38 patients respectivelythe prevalence of ed among all patients was 49 147300erectile dysfunction was scored as mild mild to moderate moderate and severe in 21 14 31 21 20 14 and 75 51 of patients respectivelythere was no significant difference between patients with ed n147 or without ed n153 as far as clinical and angiographic characteristics were concernedin the 147 patients with coexisting ed and cad ed symptoms were reported as having become clinically evident prior to cad symptoms by 99147 67 patientsthe mean time interval between the onset of ed and cad was 388 months range 1168there was no significant difference in terms of risk factor distribution and clinical and angiographic characteristics between patients with the onset of ed before vs after cad diagnosisinterestingly all patients with type i diabetes and ed actually developed sexual dysfunction before cad onset p0001conclusions our study suggests that a significant proportion of patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease have erectile dysfunction and that this latter condition may become evident prior to angina symptoms in almost 70 of casesfuture studies including a control group of patients with coronary artery disease and normal erectile function are required in order to verify whether erectile dysfunction may be considered a real predictor of ischemic heart disease
