the main objective of this study was to assess the association between dietary fiber intake and the folate status of canadian female adolescentswe also assessed dietary folate intakes and evaluated the prevalence of biochemical folate deficiency in these subjectsfemale adolescents aged 1419 y n  224 were recruited and fasting blood samples were collecteddietary intakes 3d food record were recorded and participants were classified as lactoovovegetarians semivegetarians or omnivores on the basis of foodconsumption patterns assessed with foodfrequency questionnairesfourteen percent 17 and 26 of lactoovovegetarians semivegetarians and omnivores respectively had dietary folate intakes below their predicted requirements 1 4 and 23 respectively had serum folate concentrations indicative of deficiencydespite low dietary folate intakes and serum folate concentrations few subjects had homocysteine concentrations indicative of deficiency suggesting that the degree of folate depletion had not yet produced functional consequencesmost important results suggest that the consumption of nonstarch polysaccharide is significantly associated with serum folate concentrations p  0001for each 1g increase in nonstarch polysaccharide intake a 18 increase in serum folate concentration is expectedin summary we propose that an increase in nonstarch polysaccharide intake may promote the intestinal biosynthesis of folate providing a complementary strategy to enhance the folate nutriture of humans
