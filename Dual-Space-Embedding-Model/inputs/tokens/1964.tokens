introduction previous crosssectional studies have suggested that erectile dysfunction ed represents an independent risk factor for future cardiovascular eventshowever very few studies have attempted to examine the association between ed and subsequent strokeaim the aim of this study is to estimate the risk of stroke during a 5year followup period after the first ambulatory care visit for the treatment of ed using nationwide populationbased data and a retrospective casecontrol cohort design in taiwanmethods this study used data sourced from the longitudinal health insurance databasethe study cohort comprised 1501 patients who received a principal diagnosis of ed between 1997 and 2001 and 7505 randomly selected subjects as the comparison cohorteach patient n  9006 was then individually tracked for 5 years from their index ambulatory care visit to identify those who had diagnosed episodes of strokemain outcome measure stratified cox proportional hazard regressions were performed as a means of comparing the 5year strokefree survival rate for the two cohortsresults of the sampled patients 918 102 developed stroke within the 5year followup period that is 188 individuals 125 of the patients with ed from the study cohort and 730 individuals 97 of patients in the comparison cohort from the comparison cohortthe logrank test indicated that patients with ed had significantly lower 5year strokefree survival rates than those in the comparison cohort p  0001after adjusting for the patients monthly income geographical location hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease peripheral vascular disease atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia patients with ed were more likely to have a stroke during the 5year followup period than patients in the comparison cohort hazard ratio  129 95 confidence interval  108  154 p  001conclusions these results suggest that ed is a surrogate marker for future stroke in men 2010 international society for sexual medicine
