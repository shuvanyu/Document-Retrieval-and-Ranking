introduction the use of the penile peak systolic velocity psv measured in the flaccid state during penile color doppler ultrasound pcdu examination has been questioned without substantial evidenceaim to assess the validity of psv measured in the flaccid state during pcdu in patients consulting for erectile dysfunction edmethods a consecutive series of 1346 mean age 550  120 years male patients was studiedmain outcomes measures all patients underwent pcdu performed both in the flaccid state and dynamic after prostaglandin e1 stimulation conditionsa subset of 20 subjects with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes underwent diagnostic testing for silent coronary heart disease by means of adenosine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy spectin these subjects penile arterial flow was simultaneously assessed by pcdu before and after systemic adenosine administrationresults flaccid psv showed a significant r  0513 p  00001 correlation with dynamic psvreceiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis demonstrated that when a threshold of 13 cmseconds was chosen flaccid psv was predictive for dynamic psv  25 and 35 cmseconds with an accuracy of 89 and 82 respectivelyamong the subset of patients who underwent spect an impaired coronary flow reserve icfr occurred in nine cases 45when the same threshold of 13 cmseconds was chosen psv before spect was predictive of icfr with an accuracy of 80 area under the roc curve  0798  010 p  005after adjustment for confounders anxiety symptoms were related to dynamic psv adjr  0154 p  005 but not to flaccid psvconclusions our results show that flow in the cavernosal arteries can be routinely evaluated by pcdu in the flaccid stateperforming pcdu only in the flaccid state allows identifying subjects with pathological dynamic psv with accuracy higher than 80furthermore our preliminary data suggest that the same examination could identify diabetic subjects with icfr with an accuracy of 80
