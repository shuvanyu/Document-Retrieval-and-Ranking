research on the relationship between iodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk is limited and the findings are inconclusivein most studies fishshellfish consumption has been used as a proxy measure of iodine exposurethe present study extends this research by quantifying dietary iodine exposure as well as incorporating a biomarker of longterm 1 year exposure ie from toenail clippingsthis study is conducted in a multiethnic population with a wide variation in thyroid cancer incidence rates and substantial diversity in exposurewomen ages 2074 residing in the san francisco bay area and diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1995 and 1998 19921998 for asian women were compared with women selected from the general population via random digit dialinginterviews were conducted in six languages with 608 cases and 558 controlsthe established risk factors for thyroid cancer were found to increase risk in this population radiation to the headneck odds ratio or 23 95 confidence interval ci 09755 history of goiternodules or 37 95 ci 2556 and a family history of proliferative thyroid disease or 25 95 ci 1638contrary to our hypothesis increased dietary iodine most likely related to the use of multivitamin pills was associated with a reduced risk of papillary thyroid cancerthis risk reduction was observed in lowrisk women ie women without any of the three established risk factors noted above or 053 95 ci 033085 but not in highrisk women among whom a slight elevation in risk was seen or 14 95 ci 05634however no association with risk was observed in either group when the biomarker of exposure was evaluatedin addition no ethnic differences in risk were observedthe authors conclude that iodine exposure appears to have at most a weak effect on the risk of papillary thyroid cancer
