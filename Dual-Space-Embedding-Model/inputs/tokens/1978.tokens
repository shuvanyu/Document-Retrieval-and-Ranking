watercress cruciferae an integral part of mediterranean diets is a nutritive food which is used in the treatment of several diseasesoxidative dna damage seems to play a crucial role in chronic agingrelated diseases and it is considered an important and probably carcinogenic factorthe aim of this work was to determine the impact of watercress extract on cell viability and its potential antigenotoxic properties against induced oxidative damage using a comet assay and peripheral blood cells as an in vitro modelan aqueous extract of the leaves was prepared using a juice processor centrifuged filtered and preserved at 20 ctwo concentrations of the aqueous extract 132 and 264 mgml were assayedno differences were found in cell viability between the control and treated groups at any timesignificant antigenotoxic effects were observed for both concentrations expressed as the damage index p  0005 at 30 min p  0001 at 60 and 90 min the percentage reductions in damage being similar between them 671752 respectivelythese results suggest that the consumption watercress in the diet is a powerful tool for improving health and the quality of lifecopyright  2011 john wiley  sons ltd
