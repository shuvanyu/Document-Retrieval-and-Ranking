this study was designed to determine the body burden of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes among firsttime mothers in the greater boston massachusetts area and to explore key routes of exposurewe collected breast milk samples from 46 firsttime mothers 28 weeks after birthwe also sampled house dust from the homes of a subset of participants by vacuuming commonly used areasdata on personal characteristics diet home furniture and electrical devices were gathered from each participant using a questionnairebreast milk and dust samples were analyzed for pbdes using gas chromatography mass spectrometrypbde concentrations were lognormally distributed in breast milk and dustwe found statistically significant positive associations between pbde concentrations in breast milk and house dust r  076 p  0003 not including bde209 as well as with reported dietary habits particularly the consumption of dairy products r  041 p  0005 and meat r  037 p  001due to low detection rates it was not possible to draw conclusions about the association between bde209 in milk and dustour results support the hypothesis that the indoor environment and diet both play prominent roles in adult human exposure to pbdes
