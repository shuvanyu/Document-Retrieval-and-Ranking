vitamins have traditionally been considered as food components that are required in the normal diet to prevent deficiencieshowever a newer concept of the function of vitamins in nutrition has taken them beyond simply prevention of deficiency symptomsthis concept considers that many vitamins when taken in relatively large doses have important functions beyond preventing deficiencieslinus pauling was instrumental in putting forward this concept particularly for vitamin c thus relatively high intakes of vitamins and in particular vitamins c and e which are antioxidants are considered to be healthy for the human populationthis may be true in some special situations such as for instance the prevention of alzheimers disease progressionhowever recent epidemiological evidence has not supported the claim that antioxidant vitamins increase wellbeing and prolong life spanin fact vitamin supplementation may be even detrimental and reduce life spana new concept that we would like to put forward is that nutrients upregulate the endogenous antioxidant defencesthis is particularly true in the case of phytoestrogens for example which bind to oestrogen receptors and eventually upregulate the expression of antioxidant genesin this review we discuss the pros and cons of antioxidant vitamin supplementation and also the possibility that the ingestion of some nutrients may be very effective in increasing antioxidant defences by upregulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes which are normally present in the cell
