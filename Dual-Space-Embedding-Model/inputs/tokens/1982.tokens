there has been no investigation to determine if the widely used overthecounter watersoluble antioxidants vitamin c and nacetylcysteine nac could act as prooxidants in humans during inflammatory conditionswe induced an acutephase inflammatory response by an eccentric arm muscle injurythe inflammation was characterized by edema swelling pain and increases in plasma inflammatory indicators myeloperoxidase and interleukin6immediately following the injury subjects consumed a placebo or vitamin c 125 mgkg body weight and nac 10 mgkg body weight for 7 d the resulting muscle injury caused increased levels of serum bleomycindetectable iron and the amount of iron was higher in the vitamin c and nac groupthe concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase ldh creatine kinase ck and myoglobin were significantly elevated 2 3 and 4 d postinjury and returned to baseline levels by day 7in addition ldh and ck activities were elevated to a greater extent in the vitamin c and nac grouplevels of markers for oxidative stress lipid hydroperoxides and 8iso prostaglandin f2alpha 8isopgf2alpha and antioxidant enzyme activities were also elevated postinjurythe subjects receiving vitamin c and nac had higher levels of lipid hydroperoxides and 8isopgf2alpha 2 d after the exercisethis acute human inflammatory model strongly suggests that vitamin c and nac supplementation immediately postinjury transiently increases tissue damage and oxidative stress
