context numerous recovery strategies have been used in an attempt to minimize the symptoms of delayedonset muscle soreness domswholebody vibration wbv has been suggested as a viable warmup for athleteshowever scientific evidence to support the protective effects of wbv training wbvt on muscle damage is lackingobjective to investigate the acute effect of wbvt applied before eccentric exercise in the prevention of domsdesign randomized controlled trialsetting university laboratorypatients or other participants a total of 32 healthy untrained volunteers were randomly assigned to either the wbvt n    15 or control n    17 groupinterventions volunteers performed 6 sets of 10 maximal isokinetic 60s eccentric contractions of the dominantlimb knee extensors on a dynamometerin the wbvt group the training was applied using a vibratory platform 35 hz 5 mm peak to peak with 100 of knee flexion for 60 seconds before eccentric exerciseno vibration was applied in the control groupmain outcome measures muscle soreness thigh circumference and pressure pain threshold were recorded at baseline and at 1 2 3 4 7 and 14 days postexercisemaximal voluntary isometric and isokinetic knee extensor strength were assessed at baseline immediately after exercise and at 1 2 7 and 14 days postexerciseserum creatine kinase was measured at baseline and at 1 2 and 7 days postexerciseresults the wbvt group showed a reduction in doms symptoms in the form of less maximal isometric and isokinetic voluntary strength loss lower creatine kinase levels and less pressure pain threshold and muscle soreness p  05 compared with the control grouphowever no effect on thigh circumference was evident p  05conclusions administered before eccentric exercise wbvt may reduce doms via muscle function improvementfurther investigation should be undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of wbvt in attenuating doms in athletes
