massage therapy is commonly used during physical rehabilitation of skeletal muscle to ameliorate pain and promote recovery from injuryalthough there is evidence that massage may relieve pain in injured muscle how massage affects cellular function remains unknownto assess the effects of massage we administered either massage therapy or no treatment to separate quadriceps of 11 young male participants after exerciseinduced muscle damagemuscle biopsies were acquired from the quadriceps vastus lateralis at baseline immediately after 10 min of massage treatment and after a 25hour period of recoverywe found that massage activated the mechanotransduction signaling pathways focal adhesion kinase fak and extracellular signalregulated kinase 12 erk12 potentiated mitochondrial biogenesis signaling nuclear peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1α pgc1α and mitigated the rise in nuclear factor κb nfκb p65 nuclear accumulation caused by exerciseinduced muscle traumamoreover despite having no effect on muscle metabolites glycogen lactate massage attenuated the production of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factorα tnfα and interleukin6 il6 and reduced heat shock protein 27 hsp27 phosphorylation thereby mitigating cellular stress resulting from myofiber injuryin summary when administered to skeletal muscle that has been acutely damaged through exercise massage therapy appears to be clinically beneficial by reducing inflammation and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis
