polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are persistent organic chemicals used as flame retardants in textiles plastics and consumer productsalthough pbde accumulation in humans has been noted since the 1970s few studies have investigated pbdes within the gestational compartment and none to date has identified levels in amniotic fluidthe present study reports congenerspecific brominated diphenyl ether bde concentrations in secondtrimester clinical amniotic fluid samples collected in 2009 from fifteen women in southeast michigan usatwentyone bde congeners were measured by gcmsncithe average total pbde concentration was 3795 pgml amniotic fluid range 337  21842 pgmlbde47 and bde99 were identified in all samplesbased on median concentrations the dominant congeners were bde208 209 203 206 207 and 47 representing 23 16 12 10 9 and 6 respectively of the total detected pbdespbde concentrations were identified in all amniotic fluid samples from southeast michigan supporting a need for further investigations of fetal exposure pathways and potential impacts on perinatal health
