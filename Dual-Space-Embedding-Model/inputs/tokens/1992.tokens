the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of consuming sweet cherries on plasma lipids and markers of inflammation in healthy humanshealthy men and women n  18 supplemented their diets with bing sweet cherries 280 gd for 28 d after a 12h fast blood samples were taken before the start of cherry consumption study d 0 and 7 14 and 28 d after the start of cherry supplementation study d 21 and 35 and 28 d after the discontinuation study d 64 of cherry consumptionafter cherries were consumed for 28 d circulating concentrations of creactive protein crp regulated upon activation normal tcell expressed and secreted rantes and no decreased by 25 p  005 21 p  005 and 18 p  007 respectivelyafter the discontinuation of cherry consumption for 28 d d 64 concentrations of rantes continued to decrease p  0001 whereas those of crp and no did not differ from either d 7 precherries or d 35 postcherriesplasma concentrations of il6 and its soluble receptor intercellular adhesion molecule1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases2 did not change during the studycherry consumption did not affect the plasma concentrations of total hdl ldl and vldl cholesterol triglycerides subfractions of hdl ldl vldl and their particle sizes and numbersit also did not affect fasting blood glucose or insulin concentrations or a number of other chemical and hematological variablesresults of the present study suggest a selective modulatory effect of sweet cherries on crp no and rantessuch antiinflammatory effects may be beneficial for the management and prevention of inflammatory diseases
