blueberries are rich in antioxidants known as anthocyanins which may exhibit significant health benefitsstrenous exercise is known to acutely generate oxidative stress and an inflammatory state and serves as an ondemand model to test antioxidant and antiinflammatory compoundsthe purpose of this study was to examine whether 250 g of blueberries per day for 6 weeks and 375 g given 1 h prior to 25 h of running at 72 maximal oxygen consumption counters oxidative stress inflammation and immune changestwentyfive welltrained subjects were recruited and randomized into blueberry bb n  13 or control con n  12 groupsblood muscle and urine samples were obtained preexercise and immediately postexercise and blood and urine 1 h postexerciseblood was examined for f₂isoprostanes for oxidative stress cortisol cytokines homocysteine leukocytes tcell function natural killer nk and lymphocyte cell counts for inflammation and immune system activation and ferric reducing ability of plasma for antioxidant capacitymuscle biopsies were examined for glycogen and nfkb expression to evaluate stress and inflammationurine was tested for modification of dna 8ohdg and rna 5ohmu as markers of nucleic acid oxidationa 2 treatment  3 time repeated measures anova was used for statistical analysisincreases in f₂isoprostanes and 5ohmu were significantly less in bb and plasma il10 and nk cell counts were significantly greater in bb vs conchanges in all other markers did not differthis study indicates that daily blueberry consumption for 6 weeks increases nk cell counts and acute ingestion reduces oxidative stress and increases antiinflammatory cytokines
