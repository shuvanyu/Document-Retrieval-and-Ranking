this investigation determined the efficacy of a tart cherry juice in aiding recovery and reducing muscle damage inflammation and oxidative stresstwenty recreational marathon runners assigned to either consumed cherry juice or placebo for 5 days before the day of and for 48 h following a marathon runmarkers of muscle damage creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase muscle soreness and isometric strength inflammation interleukin6 il6 creactive protein crp and uric acid total antioxidant status tas and oxidative stress thiobarbituric acid reactive species tbars and protein carbonyls were examined before and following the raceisometric strength recovered significantly faster p0024 in the cherry juice groupno other damage indices were significantly differentinflammation was reduced in the cherry juice group il6 p0001 crp p001 uric acid p005tas was 10 greater in the cherry juice than the placebo group for all postsupplementation measures p005protein carbonyls was not different however tbars was lower in the cherry juice than the placebo at 48 h p005the cherry juice appears to provide a viable means to aid recovery following strenuous exercise by increasing total antioxidative capacity reducing inflammation lipid peroxidation and so aiding in the recovery of muscle function 2009 john wiley  sons as
