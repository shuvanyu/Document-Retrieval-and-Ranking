background there is increasing interest in the potential effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes on childrens neuropsychological development but only a few small studies have evaluated such effectsobjectives our goal was to examine the association between pbde concentrations in colostrum and infant neuropsychological development and to assess the influence of other persistent organic pollutants pops on such associationmethods we measured concentrations of pbdes and other pops in colostrum samples of 290 women recruited in a spanish birth cohortwe tested children for mental and psychomotor development with the bayley scales of infant development at 1218 months of agewe analyzed the sum of the seven most common pbde congeners bdes 47 99 100 153 154 183 209 and each congener separatelyresults increasing σ7pbdes concentrations showed an association of borderline statistical significance with decreasing mental development scores β per log ngg lipid  225 95 ci 475 026bde209 the congener present in highest concentrations appeared to be the main congener responsible for this association β  240 95 ci 479 001there was little evidence for an association with psychomotor developmentafter adjustment for other pops the bde209 association with mental development score became slightly weaker β  210 95 ci 466 046conclusions our findings suggest an association between increasing pbde concentrations in colostrum and a worse infant mental development particularly for bde209 but require confirmation in larger studiesthe association if causal may be due to unmeasured bde209 metabolites including ohpbdes hydroxylated pbdes which are more toxic more stable and more likely to cross the placenta and to easily reach the brain than bde209
