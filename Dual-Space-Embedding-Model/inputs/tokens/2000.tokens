eight varieties of lettuce lactuca sativum and three varieties of endive cichorium endivia were analyzed for flavonoid composition and contenttotal flavonoid contents expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material were in the ranges of 03229 microgg for lettuce and 44248 microgg for endivefive quercetin conjugates quercetin 3ogalactoside quercetin 3oglucoside quercetin 3oglucuronide quercetin 3o6omalonylglucoside and quercetin 3orhamnoside and luteolin 7oglucuronide were measured in the greenleafed lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates cyanidin 3oglucoside and cyanidin 3o6omalonylglucoside in the redleafed varietiesthree kaempferol conjugates kaempferol 3oglucoside kaempferol 3oglucuronide and kaempferol 3o6omalonylglucoside were measured in each of the endive varietiesthe presence and identity of kaempferol 3o6omalonylglucoside in endive was shown for the first timeshredding of lettuce leaf followed by exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the green oak leaf 94 red oak leaf 43 iceberg 36 green batavia 25 lollo biondo 24 and lollo rosso 6 samples whereas cos and green salad bowl samples did not show an overall lossshredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole 32 fine frisee 13 and coarse frisee 8significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissuestorage of whole heads of both lettuce and endive in the dark at 1 degrees c and 98 humidity for 7 days resulted in losses of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 746the identification of the amounts position of substitution and nature of the sugars is important for understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of flavonoids in salads
