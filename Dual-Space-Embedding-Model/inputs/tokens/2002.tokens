background although numerous human studies have shown consistent effects of some polyphenolrich foods on several intermediate markers for cardiovascular diseases it is still unknown whether their action could be specifically related to polyphenolsobjective we investigated the effect of orange juice and its major flavonoid hesperidin on microvascular reactivity blood pressure and cardiovascular risk biomarkers through both postprandial and chronic intervention studiesdesign twentyfour healthy overweight men age 5065 y were included in a randomized controlled crossover studythroughout the three 4wk periods volunteers daily consumed 500 ml orange juice 500 ml control drink plus hesperidin cdh or 500 ml control drink plus placebo cdpall measurements and blood collections were performed in overnightfasted subjects before and after the 4wk treatment periodsthe postprandial study was conducted at the beginning of each experimental periodresults diastolic blood pressure dbp was significantly lower after 4 wk consumption of orange juice or cdh than after consumption of cdp p  002 whereas microvascular endotheliumrelated reactivity was not significantly affected when measured after an overnight fasthowever both orange juice and cdh ingestion significantly improved postprandial microvascular endothelial reactivity compared with cdp p  005 when measured at the peak of plasma hesperetin concentrationconclusions in healthy middleaged moderately overweight men orange juice decreases dbp when regularly consumed and postprandially increases endotheliumdependent microvascular reactivityour study suggests that hesperidin could be causally linked to the beneficial effect of orange juicethis trial is registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct00983086
