colon cancer is one of the serious health problems in most developed countries and its incidence rate is increasing in indiahesperetin hn 357trihydroxy4methoxyflavonone and hesperetin analogue ha were tested for their apoptosis inducing abilitymethyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay revealed a dose as well as durationdependent reduction of ht29 colon adenocarcinoma cellular growth in response to hn and ha treatmentat 24 h 70 μm of hn and 32 μm of ha showed 50 reduction of ht29 cellular growthacridine orangeethidium bromide staining showed apoptotic features of cell death induced by hn and harhodamine 123 staining showed significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by hn and hahn and ha induced dna damage was confirmed by comet tail formationlipid peroxidation markers tbars and protein oxidation marker pcc were significantly elevated in hn and ha treated groupsenzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat glutathione peroxidase gpx were slightly decreased in their activities compared to control untreated ht29 cellsresults of western blot analysis of apoptosis associated genes revealed an increase in cytochrome c bax cleaved caspase3 expression and a decrease in bcl2 expressionthese findings indicate that hn and ha induce apoptosis on ht29 via bax dependent mitochondrial pathway involving oxidantantioxidant imbalancecopyright â 2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
