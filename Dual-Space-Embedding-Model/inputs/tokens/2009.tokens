the objective of this work is to review data from epidemiological and preclinical studies addressing the potential benefits of diets based on flavonoids for cancer preventionflavonoids are subdivided into subclasses including flavonols flavones flavanones flavan3ols anthocyanidins and isoflavonesepidemiological studies suggest dietary intake of flavonoids may reduce the risk of tumors of the breast colon lung prostate and pancreashowever some studies have reported inconclusive or even harmful associationsa major challenge in the interpretation of epidemiological studies is that most of the data originate from casecontrol studies and retrospective acquisition of flavonoid intakedifferences in agricultural sociodemographics and lifestyle factors contribute to the heterogeneity in the intake of flavonoids among populations residing in the united states europe and asiadose and timing of exposure may influence the anticancer response to flavonoidrich dietsa limited number of intervention trials of flavonoids have documented cancer preventative effectsproposed anticancer mechanisms for flavonoids are inhibition of proliferation inflammation invasion metastasis and activation of apoptosisprospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to develop biomarkers of flavonoid intake and effectmechanistic studies are needed to ascertain how flavonoidrich diets influence gene regulation for cancer prevention
