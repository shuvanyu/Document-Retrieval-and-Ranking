polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are a class of brominated flame retardants bfrs used to protect people from fires by reducing the flammability of combustible materialsin recent years pbdes have become widespread environmental pollutants while body burden in the general population has been increasinga number of studies have shown that as for other persistent organic pollutants dietary intake is one of the main routes of human exposure to pbdesthe most recent scientific literature concerning the levels of pbdes in foodstuffs and the human dietary exposure to these bfrs are here reviewedit has been noted that the available information on human total daily intake through food consumption is basically limited to a number of european countries usa china and japanin spite of the considerable methodological differences among studies the results show notable coincidences such as the important contribution to the sum of total pbdes of some congeners such as bdes 47 49 99 and 209 the comparatively high contribution of fish and seafood and dairy products and the probably limited human health risks derived from dietary exposure to pbdesvarious issues directly related to human exposure to pbdes through the diet still need investigationcopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
