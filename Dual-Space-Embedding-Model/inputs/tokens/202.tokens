background animal and in vitro studies demonstrated a neurotoxic potential of brominated flame retardants a group of chemicals used in many household and commercial products to prevent firealthough the first reports of detrimental neurobehavioral effects in rodents appeared more than ten years ago human data are sparsemethods as a part of a biomonitoring program for environmental health surveillance in flanders belgium we assessed the neurobehavioral function with the neurobehavioral evaluation system nes3 and collected blood samples in a group of high school studentscrosssectional data on 515 adolescents 13617 years of age was available for the analysismultiple regression models accounting for potential confounders were used to investigate the associations between biomarkers of internal exposure to brominated flame retardants serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde congeners 47 99 100 153 209 hexabromocyclododecane hbcd and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa and cognitive performancein addition we investigated the association between brominated flame retardants and serum levels of ft3 ft4 and tshresults a twofold increase of the sum of serum pbdes was associated with a decrease of the number of taps with the preferredhand in the finger tapping test by 531 95 ci 056 to 1005 p  0029the effects of the individual pbde congeners on the motor speed were consistentserum levels above the level of quantification were associated with an average decrease of ft3 level by 018 pgml 95 ci 003 to 034 p  0020 for pbde99 and by 015 pgml 95 ci 0004 to 029 p  0045 for pbde100 compared with concentrations below the level of quantificationpbde47 level above the level of quantification was associated with an average increase of tsh levels by 101 95 ci 08 to 202 p  0033 compared with concentrations below the level of quantificationwe did not observe effects of pbdes on neurobehavioral domains other than the motor functionhbcd and tbbpa did not show consistent associations with performance in the neurobehavioral testsconclusions this study is one of few studies and so far the largest one investigating the neurobehavioral effects of brominated flame retardants in humansconsistently with experimental animal data pbde exposure was associated with changes in the motor function and the serum levels of the thyroid hormones
