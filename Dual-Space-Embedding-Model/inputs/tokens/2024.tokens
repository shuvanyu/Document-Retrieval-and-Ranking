carrageenans are sulfated linear polysaccharides of dgalactose and 36anhydrodgalactose extracted from red seaweedsthey have been used by the food industry for their gelling thickening and stabilizing properties and more recently by the meat industry for reduced fat productsmeat is a complex system of muscle tissue connective tissue fat and water during processing numerous interactions occur among all these componentsthese interactions are responsible for the functional properties of the meat systemin meat products carrageenans contribute to gel formation and water retentiontheir addition is of special interest in lowfat meat products because fat reduction often leads to unacceptable tough textureswhen carrageenans are incorporated in these formulations they improve the textural characteristics of the product by decreasing toughness and increasing juicinessalthough carrageenan interactions with milk proteins have been studied extensively the mechanism by which carrageenans interact with meat proteins and the other meat components is not fully understood
