carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the texture of commercial food productsits use increased markedly during the last half century although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitiswe performed studies to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells including normal human intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries the normal intestinal epithelial cell line ncm460 and normal rat ileal epithelial cellscells were treated with high molecular weight lambdacarrageenan at a concentration of 1 mugml for 196 h il8 il8 promoter activity total and nuclear nfkappab ikappabalpha phosphoikappabalpha and bcl10 were assessed by immunohistochemistry western blot elisa and cdna microarrayincreased bcl10 nuclear and cytoplasmic nfkappab il8 promoter activation and il8 secretion were detected following carrageenan exposureknockdown of bcl10 by sirna markedly reduced the increase in il8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the ncm460 cellsthese results show for the first time that exposure of human intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory pathway via activation of bcl10 with nfkappab activation and upregulation of il8 secretionsince bcl10 contains a caspaserecruitment domain similar to that found in nod2card15 and associated with genetic predisposition to crohns disease the study findings may represent a link between genetic and environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel diseasebecause of the high use of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet the findings may have clinical significance
