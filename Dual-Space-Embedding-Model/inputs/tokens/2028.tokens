background dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological complaint consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoearesearch has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins hormones known to cause cramping abdominal painnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids are drugs which act by blocking prostaglandin productionobjectives the purpose of this review is to compare all nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs used in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea with placebo with paracetamol and with each other to evaluate their effectiveness and safetysearch strategy we searched the cochrane menstrual disorders and subfertility group trials register 11 april 2003 cochrane central register of controlled trials 1st quarter 2003 medline 1966april 2003 and embase 1980  week 15 2003attempts were also made to identify trials from the national research register and the clinical trials registercitation lists of relevant publications review articles abstracts of major scientific meetings and included studies were also searchedselection criteria all randomised controlled comparisons of nsaid therapies versus placebo versus other nsaids or versus paracetamol when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoeadata collection and analysis two reviewers independently assessed trials for quality and extracted data calculating odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomescrossover trial data were presented in additional tables and other data were summarised descriptivelymain results in women with dysmenorrhoea nsaids were found significantly more effective for pain relief than placebo or 791 95 ci 565 to 1109 though overall adverse effects were also significantly more common or 152 95 ci 109 to 212when nsaids were compared with each other or with paracetamol there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual nsaid with regard to either efficacy or safetyhowever the available evidence had little power to detect such differences as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials most of which were unsuitable for metaanalysisreviewers conclusions nsaids are an effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea though women using them need to be aware of the significant risk of adverse effectsthere is insufficient evidence to determine which if any individual nsaid is the most safe and effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea
