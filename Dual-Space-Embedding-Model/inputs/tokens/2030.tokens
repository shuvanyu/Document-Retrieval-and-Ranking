background a reduced rectal perceptual threshold has been reported in patients with irritable bowel syndrome ibs but this phenomenon may be induced by a comorbid psychological statewe evaluated the rectal pain threshold at baseline and after conditioning repetitive rectal painful distention rrd in patients with ibs or functional abdominal pain syndrome faps which is an abdominal pain disorder and in healthy controls and determined whether rectal hypersensitivity is a reliable marker for ibsmethods the rectal sensory threshold was assessed by a barostatfirst a ramp distention of 40 mlmin was induced and the threshold of pain and the maximum tolerable pressure mmhg were measurednext rrd phasic distentions of 60s duration separated by 30s intervals was given with a tracking method until the subjects had complained of pain six timesfinally ramp distention was induced again and the same parameters were measuredthe normal value was defined by calculating the 95 confidence intervals of controlsresults five or six of the seven ibs patients showed a reduced rectal pain threshold or maximum tolerable pressure respectively at baselinein all patients with ibs both thresholds were reduced after rrd load but they were reduced in none of the patients with fapsrrd significantly reduced both thresholds in the ibs group p  005 but it had no effect in the control or faps groupsconclusions rectal hypersensitivity induced by rrd may be a reliable marker for ibsconditioninginduced visceral hypersensitivity may play a pathophysiologic role in ibs
