aim  to decrease the intensity of dyspeptic symptoms by impairing the visceral nociceptive ctype fibres with capsaicin contained in red pepper powdermethods  the study was performed on 30 patients with functional dyspepsia and without gastrooesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndromeafter a 2week washout period 15 patients received before meals randomly and in a doubleblind manner 25 gday of red pepper powder for 5 weeks and 15 patients received placeboa diary sheet was given to each patient to record each day the scores of individual and overall symptom intensity which subsequently were averaged weekly and over the entire treatment durationresults  the overall symptom score and the epigastric pain fullness and nausea scores of the red pepper group were significantly lower than those of the placebo group starting from the third week of treatmentthe decrease reached about 60 at the end of treatment in the red pepper group whilst placebo scores decreased by less than 30conclusions  red pepper was more effective than placebo in decreasing the intensity of dyspeptic symptoms probably through a desensitization of gastric nociceptive cfibres induced by its content of capsaicinit could represent a potential therapy for functional dyspepsia
