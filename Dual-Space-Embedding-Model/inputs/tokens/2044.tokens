melatonin has been attributed a role in a number of physiological processeschanges in distal skin temperature and blood pressure after intake of melatonin suggest that melatonin induces peripheral vasodilationthe effect on the cerebral blood flow is still unknownwe examined the effect of a single pulse of melatonin on cerebral and peripheral blood flow using the latter as a positive controlten male healthy volunteers mean age 22  32 yr participated in a doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled crossover studyon one occasion 10 microg melatonin were infused iv and on the other occasion saline was infused as the matching placebocerebral blood flow was measured using phase contrast magnetic resonance imagingperipheral blood flow was determined from changes in the distal to proximal skin temperature gradient and finger pulse volumeserum melatonin concentration increased from 12  5 pgml at baseline to 487  377 pgml at 5 min and 156  68 pgml at 10 min after melatonin administrationthere was no significantly different time course for cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular resistancecompared with placebo melatonin significantly increased peripheral blood flow as measured by distal to proximal skin temperature gradient and finger pulse volumethese data demonstrate that melatonin does not have an acute regulatory effect on cerebral blood flow in humans
