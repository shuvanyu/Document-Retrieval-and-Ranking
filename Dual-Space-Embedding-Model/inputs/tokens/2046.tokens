melatonin has been detected in bacteria eukaryotic unicells macroalgae plants fungi and various taxa of invertebratesalthough precise determinations are missing in many of these organisms and the roles of melatonin are still unknown investigations in some species allow more detailed conclusionsnonvertebrate melatonin is not necessarily circadian and if so not always peaking at night although nocturnal maxima are frequently foundin the cases under study the major biosynthetic pathway is identical with that of vertebratesmimicking of photoperiodic responses and concentration changes upon temperature decreases have been studied in more detail only in dinoflagellatesin plants an involvement in photoperiodism seems conceivable but requires further supportno stimulation of flowering has been demonstrated to datea participation in antioxidative protection might be possible in many aerobic nonvertebrates although evidence for a contribution at physiological levels is mostly missingprotection from stress by oxidotoxins orand extensions of lifespan have been shown in very different organisms such as the dinoflagellate lingulodinium the ciliate paramecium the rotifer philodina and drosophilamelatonin can be taken up from the food findings with possible implications in ecophysiology as well as for human nutrition and with regard to high levels in medicinal plants also in pharmacology
