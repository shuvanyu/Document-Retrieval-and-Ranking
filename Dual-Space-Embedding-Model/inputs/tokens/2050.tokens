tryptophan serotonin and melatonin present in jerte valley cherries participate in sleep regulation and exhibit antioxidant propertiesthe effect of the intake of seven different jerte valley cherry cultivars on the sleepwake cycle 6sulfatoxymelatonin levels and urinary total antioxidant capacity in middleaged and elderly participants was evaluatedvolunteers were subjected to actigraphic monitoring to record and display the temporal patterns of their nocturnal activity and rest6sulfatoxymelatonin and total antioxidant capacity were quantified by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and colorimetric assay kits respectivelythe intake of each of the cherry cultivars produced beneficial effects on actual sleep time total nocturnal activity assumed sleep and immobilityalso there were significant increases in 6sulfatoxymelatonin levels and total antioxidant capacity in urine after the intake of each cultivarthese findings suggested that the intake of jerte valley cherries exerted positive effect on sleep and may be seen as a potential nutraceutical tool to counteract oxidation
