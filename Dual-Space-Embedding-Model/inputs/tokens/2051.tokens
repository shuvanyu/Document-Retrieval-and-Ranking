background  jetlag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zonesit results from the bodys internal rhythms being out of step with the daynight cycle at the destinationmelatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to realign them with the outside worldobjectives  to assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jetlag after air travel across several time zonessearch strategy  we searched the cochrane controlled trials register medline embase psychlit and science citation index electronically and the journals aviation space and environmental medicine and sleep by handwe searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trialswe asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trialsreports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in side effects of drugs sed and sed annuals reactions weekly medline and the adverse drug reactions databases of the who uppsala monitoring centre umc and the us food  drug administrationselection criteria  randomised trials in airline passengers airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin compared with placebo or other medicationoutcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jetlag or related components such as subjective wellbeing daytime tiredness onset and quality of sleep psychological functioning duration of return to normal or indicators of circadian rhythmsdata collection and analysis  ten trials met the inclusion criteriaall compared melatonin with placebo one in addition compared it with a hypnotic zolpidemnine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessmentreports of adverse events outside trials were found through medline reactions weekly and in the who umc databasemain results  nine of the ten trials found that melatonin taken close to the target bedtime at the destination 10pm to midnight decreased jetlag from flights crossing five or more time zonesdaily doses of melatonin between 05 and 5mg are similarly effective except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 05mgdoses above 5mg appear to be no more effectivethe relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slowrelease melatonin suggests that a shortlived higher peak concentration of melatonin works betterbased on the review the number needed to treat nnt is 2the benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed and less for westward flightsthe timing of the melatonin dose is important if it is taken at the wrong time early in the day it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local timethe incidence of other side effects is lowcase reports suggest that people with epilepsy and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatoninreviewers conclusions  melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jetlag and occasional shortterm use appears to be safeit should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones particularly in an easterly direction and especially if they have experienced jetlag on previous journeystravellers crossing 24 time zones can also use it if need bethe pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be establishedthe effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy and a possible interaction with warfarin need investigation
