the antioxidant melatonin was recently identified in a variety of edible plants and seeds in high concentrationsin plants as in animals melatonin is believed to function as a free radical scavenger and possibly in photoperiodismin this study melatonin was detected and quantified in freshfrozen balaton and montmorency tart cherries prunus cerasus using highperformance liquid chromatographyboth cherry species contain high levels of melatonin compared to the melatonin concentrations in the blood of mammalsmontmorency cherries 1346  110 ngg contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do balaton cherries 206  017 nggneither the orchard of origin nor the time of harvest influenced the amount of melatonin in fresh cherriesthe implication of the current findings is that consuming cherries could be an important source of dietary melatonin inasmuch as melatonin is readily absorbed when taken orallyalso previously published data and the results presented here show that melatonin is not only endogenously produced but also present in the diet
