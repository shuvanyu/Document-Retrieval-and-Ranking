the anthocyanins 13 and cyanidin isolated from tart cherries exhibited in vitro antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities comparable to commercial productsthe inhibition of lipid peroxidation of anthocyanins 13 and their aglycon cyanidin were 39 70 75 and 57 respectively at 2mm concentrationsthe antioxidant activities of 13 and cyanidin were comparable to the antioxidant activities of tertbutylhydroquinone and butylated hydroxytoluene and superior to vitamin e at 2mm concentrationsin the antiinflammatory assay cyanidin gave ic50 values of 90 and 60 mm respectively for prostaglandin h endoperoxide synthase1 and prostaglandin h endoperoxide synthase2 enzymes
