the behavior of inhibitors of monoamine oxidasea maoa is considered in terms of the possibility of having an effective antidepressant that does not give rise to hypertensive interactions with dietary tyraminestudies with punchbiopsy samples of human intestine and rat intestinal samples show maoa to be the predominant form of the enzyme in both speciestransport studies with everted rat intestinal preparations indicate that tyramine is extensively metabolized during transport through the intestineselective inhibition of maoa by clorgyline results in a large increase in the amount of unchanged tyramine transported whereas selective inhibition of maob with ldeprenyl selegiline has no significant effectthe behavior of reversible maoa inhibitors can significantly reduce but not entirely eliminate these effects on the intestinal metabolism of tyramine but only if the inhibition is competitive in nature
