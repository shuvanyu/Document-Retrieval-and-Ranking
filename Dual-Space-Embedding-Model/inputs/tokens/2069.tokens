context the monoamine theory of depression proposes that monoamine levels are lowered but there is no explanation for how monoamine loss occursmonoamine oxidase a maoa is an enzyme that metabolizes monoamines such as serotonin norepinephrine and dopamineobjective to determine whether maoa levels in the brain are elevated during untreated depressionsetting tertiary care psychiatric hospitalpatients seventeen healthy and 17 depressed individuals with major depressive disorder that met entry criteria were recruited from the care of general practitioners and psychiatristsall study participants were otherwise healthy and nonsmokingdepressed individuals had been medication free for at least 5 monthsmain outcome measure harmine labeled with carbon 11 a radioligand selective for maoa and positron emission tomography was used to measure maoa dvs specific distribution volume an index of maoa density in different brain regions prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex posterior cingulate cortex caudate putamen thalamus anterior temporal cortex midbrain hippocampus and parahippocampusresults the maoa dvs was highly significantly elevated in every brain region assessed t test p001 to 3x107the maoa dvs was elevated on average by 34 2 sds throughout the brain during major depressionconclusions the sizable magnitude of this finding and the absence of other compelling explanations for monoamine loss during major depressive episodes led to the conclusion that elevated maoa density is the primary monoaminelowering process during major depression
