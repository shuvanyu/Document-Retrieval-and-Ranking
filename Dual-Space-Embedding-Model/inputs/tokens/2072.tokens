studies have shown that fisetin a small phytochemical molecule has antitumor activity however its antiangiogenic activity has not yet been examinedaccordingly herein we investigated the antiangiogenic efficacy and associated mechanisms of fisetin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecsfisetin 1050 Î¼m strongly inhibited the regular serum plus growth supplement and vascular endothelial growth factor vegfinduced growth up to 92 p  0001 and survival up to 16 p  0001 of huvec in a dose and timedependent mannerfisetin also caused cell cycle arrest at g1 strong and g2m moderate phases together with a decrease in cyclin d1 and an increase in p53 levelsfisetincaused cell death was accompanied by decreased expression of survivin and an increase in cleaved levels of caspases3 and 7 and polyadpribose polymerase along with an increased ratio of bax to bcl2furthermore fisetin inhibited capillarylike tube formation on matrigel up to 85 p  0001 as well as migration up to 66 p  0001 which were associated with decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos and vegf in huvecit also decreased the expression of enos vegf inducible nitric oxide synthase matrix metalloproteinase2 and 9 in a549 and du145 human cancer cellsin vivo matrigel plug assay in mice showed significant decrease in size up to 43 p  0001 vascularization and hemoglobin content up to 94 p  0001 in the plugs from fisetintreated compared with control miceoverall these results suggest that fisetin inhibits various attributes of angiogenesis which might contribute to its reported antitumor effects and therefore fisetin warrants further investigation for its angiopreventive potential toward cancer control
