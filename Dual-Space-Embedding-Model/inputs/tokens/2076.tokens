several epidemiological studies have indicated that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with a reduced risk of developing several types of cancersthis chemopreventive effect is related to the high content of these foods in phytochemicals such as polyphenols that interfere with several processes involved in cancer progression including tumor cell growth survival and angiogenesisin addition to the low intake of plantbased foods increased body mass and physical inactivity have recently emerged as other important lifestyle factors influencing cancer risk leading to the generation of lowgrade chronic inflammatory conditions which are a key process involved in tumor progressionthe objectives of the current study are to investigate the inhibitory effects of these polyphenols on angiogenesis triggered by an inflammatory cytokine il6 and to determine the mechanisms underlying this actionwe found that among the tested polyphenols apigenin and luteolin were the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors through their inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cytokine il6stat3 pathwaythese effects resulted in modulation of the activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase12 signaling triggered by il6 as well as in a marked reduction in the proliferation migration and morphogenic differentiation of endothelial cellsinterestingly these polyphenols also modulated the expression of il6 signal transducing receptor il6rÎ± and the secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme mmp2 as well as the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling socs3 proteinoverall these results may provide important new information on the role of diet in cancer preventioncopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
