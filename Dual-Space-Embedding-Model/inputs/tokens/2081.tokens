oncogenic human papillomavirus hpv infection is the main etiologic factor for cervical neoplasia although infection alone is insufficient to produce diseasecofactors such as nutritional factors may be necessary for viral progression to neoplasiaresults from previous studies have suggested that higher dietary consumption and circulating levels of certain micronutrients may be protective against cervical neoplasiathis study evaluated the role of vitamin a and carotenoids on hpv persistence comparing women with intermittent and persistent infectionsas determined by the hybrid capture ii system oncogenic hpv infections were assessed at baseline and at approximately 3 and 9 months postbaselinemultivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk of persistent hpv infection associated with each tertile of dietary and circulating micronutrientshigher levels of vegetable consumption were associated with a 54 decrease risk of hpv persistence adjusted odds ratio 046 95 confidence interval 021097also a 56 reduction in hpv persistence risk was observed in women with the highest plasma cislycopene concentrations compared with women with the lowest plasma cislycopene concentrations adjusted odds ratio 044 95 confidence interval 019101these data suggest that vegetable consumption and circulating cislycopene may be protective against hpv persistence
