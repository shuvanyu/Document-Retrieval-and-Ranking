considering the involvement of a redoxregulatory pathway in the expression of human papillomaviruses hpvs hpv type 16 hpv16immortalized human keratinocytes were treated with the antioxidant pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate pdtcpdtc induces elevated binding of the transcription factor ap1 to its cognate recognition site within the viral regulatory regiondespite of increased ap1 binding normally indispensable for efficient hpv16 transcription viral gene expression was selectively suppressed at the level of initiation of transcriptionelectrophoretic mobility supershift assays showed that the composition of the ap1 complex predominantly consisting of jun homodimers in untreated cells was alteredirrespective of enhanced cfos expression cjun was phosphorylated and became primarily heterodimerized with fra1 which was also induced after pdtc incubationadditionally there was also an increased complex formation between cjun and junbbecause both fra1 and junb overexpression negatively interferes with cjuncfos transactivation of ap1responsive genes our results suggest that the observed block in viral transcription is mainly the consequence of an antioxidantinduced reconstitution of the ap1 transcription complexsince expression of the cjuncfos gene family is tightly regulated during cellular differentiation defined reorganization of a central viral transcription factor may represent a novel mechanism controlling the transcription of pathogenic hpvs during keratinocyte differentiation and in the progression to cervical cancer
