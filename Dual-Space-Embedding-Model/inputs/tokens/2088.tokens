a recent report that 93 per cent of invasive cervical cancers worldwide contain human papillomavirus hpv may be an underestimate due to sample inadequacy or integration events affecting the hpv l1 gene which is the target of the polymerase chain reaction pcrbased test which was usedthe formerly hpvnegative cases from this study have therefore been reanalyzed for hpv serum antibodies and hpv dnaserology for hpv 16 vlps e6 and e7 antibodies was performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were hpvnegative and a sample of 48 of the 866 cases which were hpvpositive in the original studymoreover 55 of the 66 formerly hpvnegative biopsies were also reanalyzed by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for histological review while the inner sections are assayed by three different hpv pcr assays targeting different open reading frames orfsno significant difference was found in serology for hpv 16 proteins between the cases that were originally hpv pcrnegative and positivetypespecific e7 pcr for 14 highrisk hpv types detected hpv dna in 38 69 per cent of the 55 originally hpvnegative and amplifiable specimensthe hpv types detected were 16 18 31 33 39 45 52 and 58two 4 per cent additional cases were only hpv dnapositive by e1 andor l1 consensus pcrhistological analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were qualitatively inadequateonly two of the 34 adequate samples were hpvnegative on all pcr tests as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate  p 0001combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate specimens the worldwide hpv prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 997 per centthe presence of hpv in virtually all cervical cancers implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human cancerthe extreme rarity of hpvnegative cancers reinforces the rationale for hpv testing in addition to or even instead of cervical cytology in routine cervical screeningcopyright 1999 john wiley  sons ltd
