background low postprandial blood glucose is associated with low risk of metabolic diseasesa meals ability to diminish the glucose response to carbohydrates eaten during the following meal is known as the secondmeal effect smethe reduced glycemia elicited by lowglycemicindex lgi foods consumed during the first meal has been suggested as the main mechanism for smehowever lgi foods often increase colonic fermentation because of the presence of fiber and resistant starchobjective the objective was to study the sme of greater fermentation of highglycemicindex hgi and lgi carbohydrates eaten during a previous mealdesign ten healthy volunteers ate 3 breakfast test meals consisting of sponge cakes made with rapidly digestible nonfermentable amylopectin starch plus cellulose hgi meal amylopectin starch plus the fermentable disaccharide lactulose hgilac meal or slowly digestible partly fermentable amylose starch plus cellulose lgi mealfive hours later subjects were fed the same standard lunch containing 93 g available carbohydratesblood was collected for measurement of glucose insulin and nonesterified fatty acids nefasbreath hydrogen was measured as a marker of colonic fermentationpostlunch gastric emptying was measured by using ultrasonographyresults both the hgilac and lgi meals improved glucose tolerance at lunchin the case of the hgilac meal this effect was concomitant with low nefa concentrations and delayed gastric emptyingconclusion fermentable carbohydrates independent of their effect on a foods glycemic index have the potential to regulate postprandial responses to a second meal by reducing nefa competition for glucose disposal and to a minor extent by affecting intestinal motility
