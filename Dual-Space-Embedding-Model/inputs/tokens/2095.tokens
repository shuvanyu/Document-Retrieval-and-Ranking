background a high intake of white rice is associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetescosta ricans follow a staple dietary pattern that includes white rice and beans yet the combined role of these foods on cardiometabolic risk factors has not been studiedobjective we aimed to determine the association between intake of white rice and beans and the metabolic syndrome and its components in costa rican adults n  1879 without diabetesdesign multivariateadjusted means were calculated for components of the metabolic syndrome by daily servings of white rice and beans 1 1 or 1 and by the ratio of beans to white ricethe or for the metabolic syndrome was calculated by substituting one serving of beans for one serving of white riceresults an increase in daily servings of white rice was positively associated with systolic blood pressure bp triglycerides and fasting glucose and inversely associated with hdl cholesterol ptrend 001 for allan increase in servings of beans was inversely associated with diastolic bp p  0049significant trends for higher hdl cholesterol and lower bp and triglycerides were observed for 13 12 11 and 21 ratios of beans to white ricesubstituting one serving of beans for one serving of white rice was associated with a 35 95 ci 15 50 lower risk of the metabolic syndromeconclusion increasing the ratio of beans to white rice or limiting the intake of white rice by substituting beans may lower cardiometabolic risk factors
