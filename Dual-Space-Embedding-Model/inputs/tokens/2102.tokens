background in recent decades young men in some industrialized areas have reportedly experienced a decrease in semen qualityobjective we examined effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on sperm quality and reproductive hormonesmethods we investigated sperm quality and hormone concentrations in 39 sons mean age 225 years born between 1977 and 1984 to mothers exposed to dioxin after the accident in seveso italy 1976 and 58 comparisons mean age 246 years born to mothers exposed only to background dioxinmaternal dioxin levels at conception were extrapolated from the concentrations measured in 1976 serum samplesresults the 21 breastfed sons whose exposed mothers had a median serum dioxin concentration as low as 19 ppt at conception had lower sperm concentration 363 vs 863 millionml p  0002 total count 1169 vs 2311 p  002 progressive motility 358 vs 442 p  003 and total motile count 387 vs 98 million p  001 than did the 36 breastfed comparisonsthe 18 formulafed exposed and the 22 formulafed and 36 breastfed comparisons maternal dioxin background 10 ppt at conception had no spermrelated differencesfolliclestimulating hormone was higher in the breastfed exposed group than in the breastfed comparisons 41 vs 263 iul p  003 or the formulafed exposed 41 vs 26 iul p  004 and inhibin b was lower breastfed exposed group 702 breastfed comparisons 1018 pgml p  001 formulafed exposed 999 pgml p  002conclusions in utero and lactational exposure of children to relatively low dioxin doses can permanently reduce sperm quality
