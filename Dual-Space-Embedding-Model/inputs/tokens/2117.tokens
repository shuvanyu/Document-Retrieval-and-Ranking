zingerone a dietary compound was investigated for its ability to protect against radiation induced genotoxicity and apoptosis in human lymphocytes growing in vitrothe radiation antagonistic potential of zingerone was assessed by alkaline comet cytokinesisblock micronucleus apoptosis and reactive oxygen species inhibition assaystreatment of lymphocytes with zingerone 10μgml prior exposure to 2gy gamma radiation resulted in a significant reduction of frequency of micronuclei as compared to the control set of cells evaluated by cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assaysimilarly treatment of lymphocytes with zingerone prior to radiation exposure showed significant decrease in the dna damage as assessed by comet parameters such as percent tail dna and olive tail momentfurther treatment with zingerone 10μgml before irradiation significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells analyzed microscopically method and by dna ladder assaysimilarly the radiation induced reactive oxygen species levels were significantly p001 inhibited by zingeroneour study demonstrates the protective effect of zingerone against radiation induced dna damage and antiapoptotic effect in human lymphocytes which may be partly attributed to scavenging of radiation induced free radicals and also by the inhibition of radiation induced oxidative stresscopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
