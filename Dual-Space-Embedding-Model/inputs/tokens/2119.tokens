cytogenetic analysis was performed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hospital workers chronically exposed to ionizing radiation in comparison to matched nonexposed individualsthe accumulated absorbed doses calculated for the radiation workers ranged from 95 to 2094 msvthe endpoints used were chromosomal aberrations ca micronuclei mn and sister chromatid exchanges scethe frequencies of ca100 cells observed for the exposed group were significantly p0018 higher than in the control group 32 and 26 respectivelysimilarly the mean numbers of sce per cell were statistically higher p0025 in the exposed group 62 in comparison with the control group 58in the case of micronuclei analysis no significant p006 difference between both groups was found but these data should be cautiously interpreted since an increase in the frequencies of mn was found for radiation workers 30 mn100 cells compared to the control group 26 mn100 cells and this increase occur in parallel to ca and sce frequenciesthe difference between the results could be explained by the nature of ca and mn generationthe increased frequencies of ca and sce in radiation workers indicate the cumulative effect of lowlevel chronic exposure to ionizing radiation and the relevance of conducting cytogenetic analysis in parallel to physical dosimetry in the working placecopyright 2001 wileyliss inc
