background placebo treatment can significantly influence subjective symptomshowever it is widely believed that response to placebo requires concealment or deceptionwe tested whether openlabel placebo nondeceptive and nonconcealed administration is superior to a notreatment control with matched patientprovider interactions in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome ibsmethods twogroup randomized controlled three week trial august 2009april 2010 conducted at a single academic center involving 80 primarily female 70 patients mean age 4718 with ibs diagnosed by rome iii criteria and with a score 150 on the ibs symptom severity scale ibsssspatients were randomized to either openlabel placebo pills presented as placebo pills made of an inert substance like sugar pills that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in ibs symptoms through mindbody selfhealing processes or notreatment controls with the same quality of interaction with providersthe primary outcome was ibs global improvement scale ibsgissecondary measures were ibs symptom severity scale ibssss ibs adequate relief ibsar and ibs quality of life ibsqolfindings openlabel placebo produced significantly higher mean sd global improvement scores ibsgis at both 11day midpoint 5210 vs 4011 p001 and at 21day endpoint 5015 vs 3913 p  002significant results were also observed at both time points for reduced symptom severity ibssss p  008 and p  03 and adequate relief ibsar p  02 and p  03 and a trend favoring openlabel placebo was observed for quality of life ibsqol at the 21day endpoint p  08conclusion placebos administered without deception may be an effective treatment for ibsfurther research is warranted in ibs and perhaps other conditions to elucidate whether physicians can benefit patients using placebos consistent with informed consenttrial registration clinicaltrialsgov nct01010191
