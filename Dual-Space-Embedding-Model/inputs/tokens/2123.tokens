dietary factors such as fruit and vegetables are thought to reduce the risk of cancer incidence and mortalitywe investigated the effect of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables against the longterm effects of radiation exposure on the risk of cancera cohort of 36228 atomicbomb survivors of hiroshima and nagasaki for whom radiation dose estimates were currently available had their diet assessed in 1980they were followed for a period of 20 years for cancer mortalitythe jointeffect of fruit and vegetables intake and radiation exposure on risk of cancer death was examined in additive sum of effects of diet alone and radiation alone and multiplicative product of effects of diet alone and radiation alone modelsin the additive model a daily intake of fruit and vegetables significantly reduced the risk of cancer deaths by 13 compared to an intake of once or less per weekradiation exposure of 1 sievert sv increased significantly the risk of cancer death by 4849the additive jointeffects showed a lower risk of cancer among those exposed to 1 sv who had a diet rich in vegetables 491336 or fruit 481335the multiplicative model gave similar resultsthe cancer risk reduction by vegetables in exposed persons went from 52 effect of radiation alone to 32 product of effect of vegetables and radiation and cancer risk reduction by fruit was 52 radiation alone to 34 product of effect of fruit and radiationthere was no significant evidence to reject either the additive or the multiplicative modela daily intake of fruit and vegetables was beneficial to the persons exposed to radiation in reducing their risks of cancer death
