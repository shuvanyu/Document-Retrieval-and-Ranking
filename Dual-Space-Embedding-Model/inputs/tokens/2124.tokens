context ionizing radiation is a consistently identified and potentially modifiable risk factor for meningioma the most frequently reported primary brain tumor in the united statesobjective to examine the association between dental xrays the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation and risk of intracranial meningiomadesign and setting populationbased casecontrol study designparticipants the study includes 1433 intracranial meningioma cases aged 2979 years diagnosed among residents of the states of connecticut massachusetts north carolina the san francisco bay area and eight houston texas counties between may 1 2006 and april 28 2011 and 1350 controls that were frequencymatched on age sex and geographymain outcome measure the association of intracranial meningioma diagnosis with selfreport of bitewing fullmouth and panorex dental xraysresults over a lifetime cases were more than twice odds ratio or  20 95 confidence interval ci 1429 as likely as controls to report having ever had a bitewing examregardless of the age at which the films were received persons who reported receiving bitewing films on a yearly or greater frequency had an elevated risk with odds ratios of 14 95ci 1018 16 95ci 1220 19 95ci 1426 and 15 95ci 1120 for ages 10 1019 2049 and 50 years respectivelyincreased risk of meningioma was also associated with panorex films taken at a young age or on a yearly or greater frequency with persons reporting receiving such films under the age of 10 years at 49 times 95ci 18132 increased risk of meningiomano association was appreciated with location of tumor above or below the tentoriumconclusion exposure to some dental xrays performed in the past when radiation exposure was greater than in the current era appears to be associated with increased risk of intracranial meningiomaas with all sources of artificial ionizing radiation considered use of this modifiable risk factor may be of benefit to patients
