objective in light of the rapidly increasing frequency of pediatric ct examinations the purpose of our study was to assess the lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to radiation from pediatric ct materials and methods organ doses as a function of ageatdiagnosis were estimated for common ct examinations and estimated attributable lifetime cancer mortality risks per unit dose for different organ sites were appliedstandard models that assume a linear extrapolation of risks from intermediate to low doses were appliedon the basis of current standard practice the same exposures milliampereseconds were assumed independent of ageresults the larger doses and increased lifetime radiation risks in children produce a sharp increase relative to adults in estimated risk from ctestimated lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to the radiation exposure from a ct in a 1yearold are 018 abdominal and 007 headan order of magnitude higher than for adultsalthough those figures still represent a small increase in cancer mortality over the natrual background ratein the united states of approximately 600000 abdominal and head ct examinations annually performed in children under the age of 15 years a rough estimate is that 500 of these individuals might ultimately die from cancer attributable to the ct radiationconclusion the best available risk estimates suggest that pediatric ct will result in significantly increased lifetime radiation risk over adult ct both because of the increased dose per milliamperesecond and the increased lifetime risk per unit doselower milliamperesecond settings can be used for children without significant loss of informationalthough the riskbenefit balance is still strongly tilted toward benefit because the frequency of pediatric ct examinations is rapidly increasing estimates that quantitative lifetime radiation risks for children undergoing ct are not negligible may stimulate more active reduction of ct exposure settings in pediatric patients
