background the use of computed tomographic ct scans in the united states us has increased more than 3fold since 1993 to approximately 70 million scans annuallydespite the great medical benefits there is concern about the potential radiationrelated cancer riskwe conducted detailed estimates of the future cancer risks from current ct scan use in the us according to age sex and scan typemethods risk models based on the national research councils biological effects of ionizing radiation report and organspecific radiation doses derived from a national survey were used to estimate agespecific cancer risks for each scan typethese models were combined with age and sexspecific scan frequencies for the us in 2007 obtained from survey and insurance claims datawe estimated the mean number of radiationrelated incident cancers with 95 uncertainty limits ul using monte carlo simulationsresults overall we estimated that approximately 29 000 95 ul 15 00045 000 future cancers could be related to ct scans performed in the us in 2007the largest contributions were from scans of the abdomen and pelvis n  14 000 95 ul 690025 000 chest n  4100 95 ul 19008100 and head n  4000 95 ul 11008700 as well as from chest ct angiography n  2700 95 ul 13005000onethird of the projected cancers were due to scans performed at the ages of 35 to 54 years compared with 15 due to scans performed at ages younger than 18 years and 66 were in femalesconclusions these detailed estimates highlight several areas of ct scan use that make large contributions to the total cancer risk including several scan types and age groups with a high frequency of use or scans involving relatively high doses in which riskreduction efforts may be warranted
