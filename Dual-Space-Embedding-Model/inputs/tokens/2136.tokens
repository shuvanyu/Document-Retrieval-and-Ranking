this retrospective study was aimed at evaluating the effects of cigarette consumption on semen parameters in a group of men with idiopathic infertilitythe semen quality of 2 groups of men with idiopathic infertility smokers n  118 and nonsmokers n  153 were comparedconventional semen analysis was performed and sperm morphology was assessed by transmission electron microscopy temtem data were elaborated by means of a mathematical formula based on a bayesian technique able to furnish a fertility index fi and the percentages of sperm apoptosis necrosis and immaturityvalues of normality recommended by world health organization guidelines were used as a control for conventional semen analysis and values from sperm of 25 men of proven fertility were used for tem indicesinfertile smoker and nonsmoker patients showed similar sperm parameters although sperm motility and tem analysis values in both groups were significantly impaired compared with controlssmoker patients were then classified as mild or1 and or10 cigarettesd moderate 10 and 20 cigarettesday or heavy smokers or20 cigarettesdsperm concentration and fi were significantly p  05 different among the 3 considered smoker classescomparing the pairs of smoker classes sperm concentration and fi in heavy smokers were significantly lower p  05 than that observed in mild smoker and nonsmoker groupsalthough semen quality in males with idiopathic infertility seems not to be dramatically affected by cigarette consumption heavy smokers show significantly lower sperm concentration and fi another strong reason to stop smoking
