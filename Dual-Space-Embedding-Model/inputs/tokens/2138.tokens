using the infrastructure of the national atmospheric deposition program nadp numerous measurements of radionuclide wet deposition over north america were made for 167 nadp sites before and after the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station incident of march 12 2011for the period from march 8 through april 5 2011 wetonly precipitation samples were collected by nadp and analyzed for fissionproduct isotopes within wholewater and filterable solid samples by the united states geological survey using gamma spectrometryvariable amounts of 131i 134cs or 137cs were measured at approximately 21 of sampled nadp sites distributed widely across the contiguous united states and alaskacalculated 1 to 2week individual radionuclide deposition fluxes ranged from 047 to 5100 becquerels per square meter during the sampling periodwet deposition activity was small compared to measured activity already present in us soilnadp networks responded to this complex disaster and provided scientifically valid measurements that are comparable and complementary to other networks in north america and europe
