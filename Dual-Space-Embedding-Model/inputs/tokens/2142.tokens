several foods have been shown to contain natural components especially polyphenols which display antiadhesive properties against streptococcus mutans the aetiological agent responsible for dental crown caries as well as inhibition of glucosyltransferases which are the s mutans enzymes involved in the synthesis of an adherent waterinsoluble glucan from sucroseother studies have demonstrated an in vitro action on oral plaque biofilm formation and desorptionthis study evaluated whether the activity displayed in vitro by food compounds could affect the microbiological composition of saliva and dental plaque of subjects with a diet rich in these foods comparing the results with those obtained from subjects with a different dietthe foods considered were coffee barley coffee tea and winea total of 93 subjects were recruited into the studysix samples of both plaque and saliva were collected from each subject at roughly onemonthly intervalstotal bacteria total streptococci s mutans and lactobacilli counts were determined by culture in both saliva and dental plaquethe highest bacterial titres were recorded for the control population while each drinking habit subgroup showed counts roughly one log lower than the controlsthese differences in bacterial counts proved statistically significant p005as far as dental plaque was concerned while total counts did not significantly vary per mg of plaque in the subjects belonging to the different drinking habit subgroups a significant decrease p005 was observed in those subjects drinking coffee tea barley coffee and wine when mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were evaluatedin several cases a more than one log decrease was observedplaque indices were also determined and a significant p005 reduction in values was recorded in the subjects belonging the specific drinking habit subgroups compared to the control groupthis study indicates that there is a correlation between consumption of specific foods and oral health in terms of reduced plaque deposition and lower counts of odontopathogens
