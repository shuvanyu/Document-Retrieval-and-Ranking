control of dental plaquerelated diseases has traditionally relied on nonspecific removal of plaque by mechanical meansas our knowledge of oral disease mechanisms increases future treatment is likely to be more targeted for example at small groups of organisms single species or at key virulence factors they producethe aim of this review is to consider the current status as regards novel treatment approachesmaintenance of oral hygiene often includes use of chemical agents however increasing problems of resistance to synthetic antimicrobials have encouraged the search for alternative natural productsplants are the source of more than 25 of prescription and overthecounter preparations and the potential of natural agents for oral prophylaxis will therefore be consideredtargeted approaches may be directed at the blackpigmented anaerobes associated with periodontitissuch pigments provide an opportunity for targeted phototherapy with highintensity monochromatic lightstudies to date have demonstrated selective killing of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in biofilmsfunctional inhibition approaches including the use of protease inhibitors are also being explored to control periodontitisreplacement therapy by which a resident pathogen is replaced with a nonpathogenic bacteriocinproducing variant is currently under development with respect to streptococcus mutans and dental caries
