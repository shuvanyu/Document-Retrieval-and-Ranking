background the increasing prevalence of uropathogens resistant to antimicrobial agents has stimulated interest in cranberries to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections utismethods in a doubleblind doubledummy noninferiority trial 221 premenopausal women with recurrent utis were randomized to 12month prophylaxis use of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole tmpsmx 480 mg once daily or cranberry capsules 500 mg twice dailyprimary end points were the mean number of symptomatic utis over 12 months the proportion of patients with at least 1 symptomatic uti the median time to first uti and development of antibiotic resistance in indigenous escherichia coliresults after 12 months the mean number of patients with at least 1 symptomatic uti was higher in the cranberry than in the tmpsmx group 40 vs 18 p  02 and the proportion of patients with at least 1 symptomatic uti was higher in the cranberry than in the tmpsmx group 782 vs 711median time to the first symptomatic uti was 4 months for the cranberry and 8 months for the tmpsmx groupafter 1 month in the cranberry group 237 of fecal and 281 of asymptomatic bacteriuria e coli isolates were tmpsmx resistant whereas in the tmpsmx group 863 of fecal and 905 of asymptomatic bacteriuria e coli isolates were tmpsmx resistantsimilarly we found increased resistance rates for trimethoprim amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin in these e coli isolates after 1 month in the tmpsmx groupafter discontinuation of tmpsmx resistance reached baseline levels after 3 monthsantibiotic resistance did not increase in the cranberry groupcranberries and tmpsmx were equally well toleratedconclusion in premenopausal women tmpsmx 480 mg once daily is more effective than cranberry capsules 500 mg twice daily to prevent recurrent utis at the expense of emerging antibiotic resistancetrial registration isrctnorg identifier isrctn50717094
