purpose the fecalperinealurethral hypothesis to explain the cause of urinary tract infections uti by enteric bacteria has been supported by longitudinal studies using methods of serotyping and detecting urovirulence factors such as p fimbriaehowever genetic techniques to more accurately characterize escherichia coli strains have not been exploitedmaterials and methods a total of 2700 e coli colonies isolated from the urine and rectal swabs of 9 female subjects with acute uncomplicated cystitis and from the rectal swabs of 30 healthy women were serotyped and examined for genes encoding various urovirulence factors by colony hybridization testthe clonality of the urine and fecal isolates of e coli from the cystitis subjects was further evaluated by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis pfgeresults e coli strains causing cystitis dominated the rectal flora of 7 of 9 patientsin the remaining 2 patients similar clones comprised at least 20 of the fecal floracarriage of e coli strains with a variety of urovirulence factors was quite common among healthy womenpfge demonstrated that most of the isolates sharing the same serotypic characteristics and virulence factors in the urine and rectal swab samples from each subject were identicalconclusions based upon precise genetic techniques our results clearly support the fecalperinealurethral hypothesis indicating that e coli strains residing in the rectal flora serve as a reservoir for urinary tract infections eg cystitis
