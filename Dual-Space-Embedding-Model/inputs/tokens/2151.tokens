most human extraintestinal escherichia coli infections including those involving antimicrobial resistant strains are caused by the members of a limited number of distinctive e coli lineages termed extraintestinal pathogenic e coli expec that have a special ability to cause disease at extraintestinal sites when they exit their usual reservoir in the hosts intestinal tractmultiple lines of evidence suggest that many of the expec strains encountered in humans with urinary tract infection sepsis and other extraintestinal infections especially the most extensively antimicrobialresistant strains may have a food animal source and may be transmitted to humans via the food supplythis review summarizes the evidence that foodborne organisms are a significant cause of extraintestinal e coli infections in humans
