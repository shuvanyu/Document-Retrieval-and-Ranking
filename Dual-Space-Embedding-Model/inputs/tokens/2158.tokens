bacterial vaginosis bv is a common condition of unknown etiology and has been linked to adverse reproductive and obstetric health outcomesprior dietary research on bv has focused on specific macro and micronutrients but not dietary indiceswe assessed the relationship between bv and selected dietary indicators among a cohort of 1735 nonpregnant women ages 1544 y from birmingham alabamaannual intake was assessed with the block98 ffq and the glycemic index glycemic load gl and healthy eating index were calculated by the block dietary data systemthe naturally nutrient rich nnr score was also calculatedvaginal flora was evaluated using nugent gramstain criteriacrude or and adjusted or were determined by multinomial and logistic regression in crosssectional and prospective analyses respectivelyparticipants were predominantly african american 855 aged 253  68 y mean  sdper 10unit increase gl was positively adjusted or  101 95 ci  100103 and nnr was negatively adjusted or  093 95 ci  088099 associated with bv compared to normal vaginal florain prospective analyses only gl was associated with bv progression adjusted or  103 95 ci  100105 and persistence adjusted or  102 95 ci  101104 after adjustmentboth gl and nnr were associated with greater bv prevalence and gl was associated with an increase in bv persistence and acquisitionthese results suggest that diet composition may contribute to vaginal flora imbalances and be important for elucidating the etiology of bv
