the triptans selective serotonin 5ht1b1d agonists are very effective acute migraine drugssoon seven different triptans will be clinically available at 13 different oral doses making evidencebased selection guidelines necessarytriptan trials have similar designs facilitating metaanalysiswe wished to provide an evidencebased foundation for using triptans in clinical practice and to review the methodological issues surrounding triptan trialswe asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of companyindependent trials for the raw patient data of all doubleblind randomized controlled clinical trials with oral triptans in migraineall data were crosschecked with published or presented datawe calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters and compared these with those from direct headtohead comparator trialsout of 76 eligible clinical trials 53 12 not yet published involving 24089 patients met the criteria for inclusionmean results and 95 confidence intervals for sumatriptan 100 mg the first available and most widely prescribed oral triptan are 59 5760 for 2 h headache response improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain 29 2730 for 2 h pain free improvement to no pain 20 1821 for sustained pain free pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 224 h postdose and 67 6370 for consistency response in at least two out of three treated attacks placebosubtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event ae are 13 818 for at least one central nervous system ae 6 39 and for at least one chest ae 19 1027compared with these data rizatriptan 10 mg shows better efficacy and consistency and similar tolerability eletriptan 80 mg shows better efficacy similar consistency but lower tolerability almotriptan 125 mg shows similar efficacy at 2 h but better sustained painfree response consistency and tolerability sumatriptan 25 mg naratriptan 25 mg and eletriptan 20 mg show lower efficacy and better tolerability zolmitriptan 25 mg and 5 mg eletriptan 40 mg and rizatriptan 5 mg show very similar resultsthe results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall patternwe received no data on frovatriptan but publicly available data suggest substantially lower efficacythe major methodological issues involve the choice of the primary endpoint consistency over multiple attacks how to evaluate headache recurrence use of placebosubtracted proportions to control for acrossstudy differences and the difference between tolerability and safetyin addition there are a number of methodological issues specific for direct comparator trials including encapsulation and patient selectionat marketed doses all oral triptans are effective and well tolerateddifferences among them are in general relatively small but clinically relevant for individual patientsrizatriptan 10 mg eletriptan 80 mg and almotriptan 125 mg provide the highest likelihood of consistent successsumatriptan features the longest clinical experience and the widest range of formulationsall triptans are contraindicated in the presence of cardiovascular disease
