migraine treatment has evolved from the realms of the supernatural into the scientific arena but it seems still controversial whether migraine is primarily a vascular or a neurological dysfunctionirrespective of this controversy the levels of serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine 5ht a vasoconstrictor and a central neurotransmitter seem to decrease during migraine with associated carotid vasodilatation whereas an ivinfusion of 5ht can abort migrainein fact 5ht as well as ergotamine dihydroergotamine and other antimigraine agents invariably produce vasoconstriction in the external carotid circulationthe last decade has witnessed the advent of sumatriptan and second generation triptans egzolmitriptan rizatriptan naratriptan which belong to a new class of drugs now known as 5ht1b1d1f receptor agonistscompared to sumatriptan the secondgeneration triptans have a higher oral bioavailability and longer plasma halflifein line with the vascular and neurogenic theories of migraine all triptans produce selective carotid vasoconstriction via 5ht1b receptors and presynaptic inhibition of the trigeminovascular inflammatory responses implicated in migraine via 5ht1d5ht1f receptorsmoreover selective agonists at 5ht1d pnu142633 and 5ht1f ly344864 receptors inhibit the trigeminovascular system without producing vasoconstrictionnevertheless pnu142633 proved to be ineffective in the acute treatment of migraine whilst ly344864 did show some efficacy when used in doses which interact with 5ht1b receptorsfinally although the triptans are effective antimigraine agents producing selective cranial vasoconstriction efforts are being made to develop other effective antimigraine alternatives acting via the direct blockade of vasodilator mechanisms egantagonists at cgrp receptors antagonists at 5ht7 receptors inhibitors of nitric oxide biosynthesis etcthese alternatives will hopefully lead to fewer sideeffects
