there is widespread belief that the use of aromatherapy and massage in an intensive care environment offers a means of increasing the quality of sensory input that patients receive as well as reducing levels of stress and anxietydespite a wealth of anecdotal evidence in support of these claims there have been few objective studies to evaluate the effects of these therapiesin this experimental study 122 patients admitted to a general intensive care unit were randomly allocated to receive either massage aromatherapy using essential oil of lavender or a period of restboth pre and posttherapy assessments included physiological stress indicators and patients evaluation of their anxiety levels mood and ability to cope with their intensive care experienceninetythree patients 77 were able to complete subjective assessmentsthere were no statistically significant differences in the physiological stress indicators or observed or reported behaviour of patients ability to cope following any of the three interventionshowever those patients who received aromatherapy reported significantly greater improvement in their mood and perceived levels of anxietythey also felt less anxious and more positive immediately following the therapy although this effect was not sustained or cumulative
