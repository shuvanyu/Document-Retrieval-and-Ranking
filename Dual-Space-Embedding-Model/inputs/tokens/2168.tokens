the potential genotoxicity of lavender essential oil and its major components linalool and linalyl acetate was evaluated in vitro by the micronucleus test on peripheral human lymphocytesin the range of nontoxic concentrations 05100 Î¼gml linalyl acetate increased the frequency of micronuclei significantly and in concentrationdependent manner lavender oil did so only at the highest concentration tested whereas linalool was devoid of genotoxicitynone of the tested substances led to an increase in nucleoplasmic bridges or nuclear buds frequencythese findings suggest that the mutagenic activity of lavender oil can be related to the presence of linalyl acetate which seems to have a profile of an aneugenic agentcopyright  2010 wileyliss inc
