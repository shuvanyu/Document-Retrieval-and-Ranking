objective investigate the effects of lavender oil on the central nervous system autonomic nervous system and mood responses in humans after inhalationmaterial and method twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experimentsthe present study assessed autonomic parameters such as blood pressure heart rate respiratory rate and skin temperature to determine the arousal level of the autonomic nervous systemin addition subjects were asked to estimate their mood responses such as feeling pleasant or unpleasant uncomfortable sensuality relaxation or refreshing in order to assess subjective behavioral arousalfinally electroencephalogram eeg was recorded from 31 electrodes on the scalp according to the international 10 to 20 system and eeg power spectra were calculated by fast fourier transform fftdata was analyzed by comparing the effects of lavender oil on physiological and mood states with sweet almond oilthese assessments were measured before and after using paired ttest statistical procedureresults the results revealed that lavender oil caused significant decreases of blood pressure heart rate and skin temperature which indicated a decrease of autonomic arousalin terms of mood responses the subjects in the lavender oil group categorized themselves as more active fresher relaxed than subjects just inhaling base oilcompared with base oil lavender oil increased the power of theta 48 hz and alpha 813 hz brain activitiesthe topographic map showed obviously more scattering power in alpha range waves particularly in bilateral temporal and central areaconclusion the findings provided evidence the relaxing effect of inhaling lavender oil
