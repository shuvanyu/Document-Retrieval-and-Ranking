i hypothesize here that the ability of probiotics to synthesize neuroactive compounds provides a unifying microbial endocrinologybased mechanism to explain the hitherto incompletely understood action of commensal microbiota that affect the hosts gastrointestinal and psychological healthonce ingested probiotics enter an interactive environment encompassing microbiological immunological and neurophysiological componentsby utilizing a transdisciplinary framework known as microbial endocrinology mechanisms that would otherwise not be considered become apparent since any candidate would need to be shared among all three componentsthe range of neurochemicals produced by probiotics includes neurochemicals for which receptorbased targets on immune and neuronal elements intestinal and extraintestinal have been well characterizedproduction of neurochemicals by probiotics therefore allows for their consideration as delivery vehicles for neuroactive compoundsthis unifying microbial endocrinologybased hypothesis which may facilitate the selection and design of probiotics for clinical use also highlights the largely unrecognized role of neuroscience in understanding how microbes may influence healthcopyright  2011 wiley periodicals inc
