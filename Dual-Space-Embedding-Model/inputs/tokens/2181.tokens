background probiotics may improve a persons health by regulating their immune functionsome studies show that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infectionshowever no evidence of the benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections urtis and related potential adverse effects has been publishedobjectives to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing acute urtissearch strategy we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central the cochrane library 2011 issue 2 which includes the cochrane acute respiratory infections groups specialised register medline ovid 1950 to may week 1 2011 embase 1974 to may 2011 web of science which includes science citation index from 1900 to may 2011 and conference proceedings citation index from 1991 to may 2011 the chinese biomedical literature database which includes the china biological medicine database from 1978 to may 2011 the chinese medicine popular science literature database from 2000 to may 2011 and the masters degree dissertation of beijing union medical college database from 1981 to may 2011selection criteria randomised controlled trials rcts comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute urtisdata collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed eligibility quality of trials and extracted datamain results we included 14 rcts although we could only extract available data to metaanalyse in 10 trials which involved 3451 participantswe found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute urti at least one episode odds ratio or 058 95 confidence interval ci 036 to 092 at least three episodes or 053 95 ci 036 to 080 rate ratio of episodes of acute urti rate ratio 088 95 ci 081 to 096 and reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute urtis or 067 95 ci 045 to 098probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the mean duration md of an episode of acute urti md 029 95 ci 371 to 313 and adverse events or 092 95 ci 037 to 228side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonwe found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when conducting pooled analysesauthors conclusions probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute urtis the rate ratio of episodes of acute urti and reducing antibiotic usethis indicates that probiotics may be more beneficial than placebo for preventing acute urtishowever the results have some limitations and there were no data for older people
