background infants with wheezing and allergic diseases have a microflora that differs from that of healthy infantsthe fetus acquires microorganisms during birth when exposed to the maternal vaginal microflorait is therefore conceivable that the maternal vaginal microflora might influence the establishment of the infant flora and as a consequence the development of wheezing and allergic diseasesobjective we sought to study the associations between the composition of the maternal vaginal microflora and the development of wheezing and asthma in childhoodmethods we performed a populationbased cohort study in denmarkvaginal samples for bacterial analysis were obtained during pregnancya total of 2927 women 80 of the invited women completed the study and had 3003 live infantsinfant wheezing was assessed as one or more hospitalizations for asthma between 0 and 3 years of ageasthma was assessed as use of 3 or more packages of antiasthma medication between 4 and 5 years of ageresults maternal vaginal colonization with ureaplasma urealyticum during pregnancy was associated with infant wheezing odds ratio or 20 95 ci 1236 but not with asthma during the fifth year of lifematernal colonization with staphylococci or 22 95 ci 1434 and use of antibiotics in pregnancy or 17 95 ci 1126 were associated with asthma during the fifth year of lifeconclusion the composition of the maternal vaginal microflora might be associated with wheezing and asthma in the offspring up to 5 years of age
