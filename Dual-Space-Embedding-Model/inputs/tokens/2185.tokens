background studies of delivery by caesarean section csection and the offsprings risk of allergic diseases are of current interest due to concerns about the increased use of csection in many countrieshowever previous studies have reported inconsistent findingsobjective we investigated whether delivery by csection is associated with an increased risk of atopy and allergic disease by reviewing the literature performing a metaanalysis and assessing publication biasmethods we used a systematic literature search of medline 1966 to may 2007six common allergic outcomes were included food allergyfood atopy inhalant atopy eczemaatopic dermatitis allergic rhinitis asthma and hospitalization for asthmafor each outcome a metaanalysis was performed where a summary odds ratio or was calculated taking into account heterogeneity between the studyspecific relative riskspublication bias was assessed using the funnel plot methodresults we identified 26 studies on delivery by csection and one or more of the six allergic outcomescsection was associated with an increased summary or of food allergyfood atopy or 132 95 ci 112155 six studies allergic rhinitis or 123 95 ci 112135 seven studies asthma or 118 95 ci 105132 13 studies and hospitalization for asthma or 121 95 ci 112131 seven studies whereas there was no association with inhalant atopy or 106 95 ci 082138 four studies and eczemaatopic dermatitis or 103 95 ci 098109 six studiesfunnel plots indicated that the association with food allergyfood atopy could be difficult to interpret due to publication biasfor each significant association with an allergic outcome only 14 of cases were attributable to csectionconclusion delivery by csection is associated with a moderate risk increase for allergic rhinitis asthma hospitalization for asthma and perhaps food allergyfood atopy but not with inhalant atopy or atopic dermatitisthe increased use of csection during the last decades is unlikely to have contributed much to the allergy epidemic observed during the same period
