purpose of review diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of visual impairment in workingage adults worldwidepan retinal photocoagulation prp has provided an effective treatment to decrease the risk of severe vision loss in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy for the past four decadespattern scan laser pascal was developed to minimize the side effects of prpthe purpose of this review is to discuss the differences between the traditional argon laser and the pascalrecent findings pascal can achieve comparable results with the conventional argon prp in the treatment of patients with diabetic retinopathythe pascal delivery system creates well aligned arrays of retinal lesions in a shorter periodpascal provides amore comfortable profile when compared to the argon lasersummary the pascal is now being substituted for the conventional argon laser for prp in many clinicsophthalmologists should keep in mind that adjusting the pascal settings including the duration number and size of laser burns might become necessary to maintain regression and eliminate recurrence of neovascularization in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathyfurther studies are needed to determine the parameters for optimal safety and efficacy on the pascal
