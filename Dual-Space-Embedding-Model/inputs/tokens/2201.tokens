estrogen synthesized in situ plays a more important role in breast cancer cell proliferation than does circulating estrogenaromatase is the enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen and is expressed at a higher level in breast cancer tissue than in surrounding noncancer tissuea promising route of chemoprevention against breast cancer may be through the suppression of in situ estrogen formation using aromatase inhibitorsa diet high in fruits and vegetables may reduce the incidence of breast cancer because they contain phytochemicals that can act as aromatase inhibitorsin our previous studies we found that grapes and wine contain potent phytochemicals that can inhibit aromatasewe show that red wine was more effective than white wine in suppressing aromatase activityinterestingly our results from white wine studies suggest a weak inductive effect of alcohol on aromatase activityon the other hand the potent effect of antiaromatase chemicals in red wine overcomes the weak inductive effect of alcohol in wineseveral purification procedures were performed on whole red wine to separate active aromatase inhibitors from nonactive compoundsthese techniques included liquidliquid extraction silica gel chromatography various solid phase extraction spe columns and high performance liquid chromatographyan active pinot noir red wine spe c18 column fraction 20 acetonitrilewater was more effective than complete pinot noir wine in suppressing aromatase assaythis red wine extract was further analyzed in a transgenic mouse model in which aromatase was overexpressed in mammary tissueour gavaged red wine extract completely abrogated aromataseinduced hyperplasia and other neoplastic changes in mammary tissuethese results suggest that red wine or red wine extract may be a chemopreventive diet supplement for postmenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancerfurther research is underway to purify and characterize the active compounds in red wine that are responsible for the inhibition of aromatase
