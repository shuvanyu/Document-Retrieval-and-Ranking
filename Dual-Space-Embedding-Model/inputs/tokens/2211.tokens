the incidence of autoimmune allergic and inflammatory disease is increasing due to as yet unidentified environmental factors related to western living conditionshere i propose that alterations in the gut microbiome acting via regulatory t cells tregs may be responsible for this epidemictregs control the threshold for peripheral antigen recognition via tonic downregulation of dendritic cell dc costimulation and are also implicated in maintaining the tolerogenic function of dcsin this model minor perturbations in treg number or function are predicted to lower the activation threshold allowing proliferation and differentiation of selfreactive cd4t cells of too low an affinity to have undergone negative selection in the thymusfailure to maintain the tolerogenic commitment of dcs exposed to commensal microbes and allergens could result in potentially pathogenic allergic and inflammatory responses at epithelial surfaces
