purpose the aim of this study was to assess the effects of topical application of a 10 ww freezedried black raspberry fbr gel on oral intraepithelial neoplasia ien variables that included histologic diagnoses and loss of heterozygosity loh indicesmicrosatellite instability andor loh at tumor suppressor gene  associated chromosomal loci have been associated with a higher risk for oral ien progression to oral squamous cell carcinomapreviously our laboratories have shown that fbrs are well tolerated and possess potent antioxidant apoptotic and differentiationinducing propertiesexperimental design each participant with ien served as their own internal controlbefore treatment all lesions were photographed and lesional tissue was hemisected to obtain a pretreatment diagnosis and baseline biochemical and molecular variablesgel dosing 05 g applied four times daily for 6 weeks was initiated 1 week after the initial biopsygenomic dna was isolated from lasercaptured basilar and suprabasilar surface epithelial cells followed by pcr amplification using primer sets that targeted known and presumed tumor suppressor gene loci associated with ink4aarf p53 and fhitallelic imbalance was determined by sequence analysis using normal participant tissues to establish microsatellite marker peak patterns and allele sizesresults confirming earlier phase i data none of the 27 participants developed fbr gel  associated toxicitiesfurthermore our results show histologic regression in a subset of patients as well as statistically significant reduction in loh at tumor suppressor gene  associated lociconclusions these preliminary data suggest that further evaluation of berry gels for oral ien chemoprevention is warranted
