purpose the objective of this study was to formulate and evaluate freezedried black raspberry fbr ethanol extract re loaded polydllacticcoglycolic acid plga and polydllactic acid pla injectable millicylindrical implants for sustained delivery of chemopreventive fbr anthocyanins cyanidin3sambubioside cs cyanidin3glucoside cg and cyanidin3rutinoside crmethods identification and quantitation of cs cg and cr in re was performed by mass spectroscopy and hplcretriacetylβcyclodextrin taβcd inclusion complex ic was prepared by a kneading method and characterized by xray diffraction xrd nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and uvvisible spectroscopyre or retaβcd icloaded plga or pla implants were prepared by a solvent extrusion methodin vitro and in vivo controlled release studies were conducted in phosphatebuffered saline tween80 ph 74 37c and after subcutaneous administration in male spraguedawley rats respectivelyanthocyanins were quantified by hplc at 520 nmresults the content of cs cg and cr in re was 02 15 and 35 wt respectivelythe chemical stability of anthocyanins in solution was determined to be phdependent and their degradation rate increased with an increase in ph from 24 to 74plgapla millicylindrical implants loaded with 5 or 10 wt re exhibited a high initial burst and short release duration of anthocyanins 3552 and 80100 cg  cr release after 1 and 14 days respectivelythe cause for rapid anthocyanins release was linked to higher polymer water uptake and porosity associated with the high osmolytic components of large nonanthocyanin fraction of rexrd 1h nmr and uvvisible spectroscopy indicated that the nonanthocyanin fraction molecules of re formed an ic with taβcd decreasing the hydrophilicity of reformation of an ic with hydrophobic carrier taβcd provided better in vitroin vivo sustained release of fbr anthocyanins 1624 and 9799 cg  cr release respectively after 1 and 28 days from 20 wt retaβcd icpla implants over 1 month owing to reduced polymer water uptake and porosityconclusion pla injectable millicylindrical implants loaded with retaβcd ic are optimal dosage forms for 1month slow and continuous delivery of chemopreventive fbr anthocyanins
