reduced expression of proapoptotic and terminal differentiation genes in conjunction with increased levels of the proinflammatory and angiogenesisinducing enzymes cyclooxygenase 2 cox2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos correlate with malignant transformation of oral intraepithelial neoplasia ienaccordingly this study investigated the effects of a 10 ww freezedried black raspberry gel on oral ien histopathology gene expression profiles intraepithelial cox2 and inos proteins and microvascular densitiesour laboratories have shown that freezedried black raspberries possess antioxidant properties and also induce keratinocyte apoptosis and terminal differentiationoral ien tissues were hemisected to provide samples for pretreatment diagnoses and establish baseline biochemical and molecular variablestreatment of the remaining lesional tissue 05 g gel applied four times daily for 6 weeks began 1 week after the initial biopsyrna was isolated from snapfrozen ien lesions for microarray analyses followed by quantitative reverse transcriptionpcr validationadditional epithelial genespecific quantitative reverse transcriptionpcr analyses facilitated the assessment of target tissue treatment effectssurface epithelial cox2 and inos protein levels and microvascular densities were determined by image analysis quantified immunohistochemistrytopical berry gel application uniformly suppressed genes associated with rna processing growth factor recycling and inhibition of apoptosisalthough the majority of participants showed posttreatment decreases in epithelial inos and cox2 proteins only cox2 reductions were statistically significantthese data show that berry gel application modulated oral ien gene expression profiles ultimately reducing epithelial cox2 proteinin a patient subset berry gel application also reduced vascular densities in the superficial connective tissues and induced genes associated with keratinocyte terminal differentiation
