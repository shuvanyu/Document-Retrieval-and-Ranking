drug resistance remains an ongoing challenge in ovarian cancer chemotherapythe objective of this study was to determine the effect on synergism in activity from the sequenced combinations of cisplatin cis with curcumin cur and epigallocatechin3gallate egcg in the human ovarian cancer cell linesthe drugs were added in binary combinations cis combined with cur and cis combined with egcg to the human ovarian a2780 and a2780cisr cancer cell lines using five different sequences of administration 00 h 40 h 04 h 240 h and 024 h the combination index ci was used to assess the combined action of the drugscis 1 1 and 1 indicated synergism additiveness and antagonism respectivelycellular accumulation of platinum and platinumdna binding levels from cis and its combination with the phytochemicals were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometryaddition of cis 4 h before cur and egcg 04 h combination produced the most synergistic outcomes in both the a2780 and a2780cisr cell linesthe cellular accumulations of platinum and platinumdna binding resulting from the 04 h combinations were greater as compared to the values using cis alone thus providing an explanation for the synergistic actionwhen sequenced combinations of cis with cur and with egcg are applied to human ovarian a2780 and a2780cisr cancer cell lines lower concentrations and shorter time gap between the two additions seem to produce a higher cytotoxic effect
