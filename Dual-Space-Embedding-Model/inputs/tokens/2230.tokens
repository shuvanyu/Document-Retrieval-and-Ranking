background endoscopic submucosal dissection esd is an advanced technique of therapeutic endoscopy alternative to endoscopic mucosal resection emr for superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms 2 cmesd allows for the direct dissection of the submucosa and large lesions can be resected en blocesd is not limited by resection size increases histologically complete resection rates and may reduce the local recurrencenevertheless the technique is timeconsuming technically demanding and associated with a high complication rateto reduce the risk of complications different devices and technical advances have been proposed with conflicting results and still esd en bloc resections of huge lesions are associated with increased complicationscase presentation we successfully used a combined esdemr technique for huge rectal laterally spreading tumors lstsesd was used for circumferential resection of 23 of the lesion followed by piecemeal resection 23 pieces of the central part of the tumourin all three patients we obtained the complete dissection of the polyp and the complete histological evaluation in absence of complications and recurrence at 6 months follow upconclusions in the treatment of rectal lsts the combined treatment  esdemr resection may be considered a suitable therapeutic option indicated in selected cases as an alternative to surgery in which the two techniques are neither reliable nor safe separatelyhowever to confirm our results larger trials with longer follow up are required together with improvement of the technique and of the technical devices
