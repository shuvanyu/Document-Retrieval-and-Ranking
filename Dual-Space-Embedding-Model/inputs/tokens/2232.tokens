cranberry products and especially cranberry juice cj have been consumed for health reasons primarily due to their effect on urinary tract infectionswe investigated the quantity of both free and total after hydrolysis phenolic antioxidants in cranberry products using the folin assaythe order of amount of total polyphenols in cranberry foods on a fresh weight basis was as follows dried  frozen  sauce  jellied sauceon a serving size basis for all cranberry products the order was as follows frozen  100 juice  dried  27 juice  sauce  jellied saucehigh fructose corn syrup hfcs is a major source of sugar consumption in the us and contains both glucose and fructose potential mediators of oxidative stresswe investigated the effect of the consumption of hfcs and ascorbate with cj antioxidants or without cj control given to 10 normal individuals after an overnight fastplasma antioxidant capacity glucose triglycerides and ascorbate were measured 6 times over 7 h after the consumption of a single 240 ml serving of the two different beveragesthe control hfcs caused a slight decrease in plasma antioxidant capacity at all time points and thus an oxidative stress in spite of the presence of ascorbatecj produced an increase in plasma antioxidant capacity that was significantly greater than control hfcs at all time pointspostprandial triglycerides due to fructose in the beverages were mainly responsible for the oxidative stress and were significantly correlated with the oxidative stress as measured by the antioxidant capacitycranberries are an excellent source of high quality antioxidants and should be examined in human supplementation studies
