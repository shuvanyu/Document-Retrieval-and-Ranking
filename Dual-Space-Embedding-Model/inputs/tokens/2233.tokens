the human health benefits from consumption of cranberry products have been associated with the fruits unique flavonoid composition including a complex profile of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidinshowever when processed by techniques such as pressing canning concentrating or drying a number of these natural components may be compromised or inactivated due to physical separation thermal degradation or oxidationfresh cranberries were compared to freezedried berries and individual fruit tissues skin and peeled fruitproducts examined included cranberry juices commercial and prepared from concentrate cranberry sauces commercial and homemade and sweeteneddried cranberries commercialfreezedrying resulted in no detectable losses of anthocyanins or proanthocyanidins from cranberry fruitsanthocyanins were localized in the skinproanthocyanins were higher in the skin than in the flesh with the exception of procyanidin a2 dimer which was concentrated in the fleshanthocyanins were significantly higher in notfromconcentrate juice than in reconstituted juice from concentrate 83 mg and 42 mg100 ml respectivelysimilarly proanthocyanidins were markedly higher in notfromconcentrate juice compared to juice from concentrate 230 mg and 89 mg100 ml respectivelyhomemade sauce contained far higher anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins 159 and 879 mg100 g respectively than canned sauces processed with whole berries 96 and 544 mg100 g respectively or jelledtype 11 and 16 mg100 g respectivelysweeteneddried cranberries were quite low in anthocyanins 79 mg100 g but they still retained considerable proanthocyanidins 642 mg100 gcommercially processed products contained significantly lower levels of polyphenols as compared to fresh and homeprocessed preparationsanthocyanins were more sensitive to degradation than proanthocyanidinspractical application as cranberry juices and other products are increasingly consumed for their recognized health benefits including prophylaxis against urinary tract infection it is relevant to consider how various degrees of commercial and home processing can alter innate levels of the biologically active flavonoids especially anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins characteristic to the intact fruits 2012 institute of food technologists
