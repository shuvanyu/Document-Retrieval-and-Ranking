anthocyanins were isolated from male bracts of 10 wild species of bananas musa sppand ensete sppdistributed in thailandsix major anthocyanin pigments were identified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc mass spectrometry ms and tandem mass spectrometry msmsthey are delphinidin3rutinoside mz 6112 cyanidin3rutinoside mz 5958 petunidin3rutinoside mz 6249 pelargonidin3rutinoside mz 5794 peonidin3rutinoside mz 6087 and malvidin3rutinoside mz 6388on the basis of the types of pigment present the wild bananas can be divided into 5 groupsthe first group comprises m itinerans musa spone musa sptwo and m acuminata accessions which contain almost or all anthocyanin pigments except for pelargonidin3rutinoside including both nonmethylated and methylated anthocyaninsthe second group m acuminata subsptruncata contains only malvidin3rutinoside while the third group m coccinea contains cyanidin3rutinoside and pelargonidin3rutinosidethe forth group m acuminata yellow bract and e glaucum do not appear to contain any anthocyanin pigmentthe fifth group consists of m balbisiana m velutina m laterita and e superbum which contain only nonmethylated anthocyanin delphinidin3rutinoside and cyanidin3rutinosidetotal anthocyanin content in the analyzed bracts ranged from 011970 mg100 g bract fresh weightthe differences in the type of anthocyanin and variation in the amounts present indicate that wild bananas show biochemical diversity which may be useful for identifying specific groups of bananas or for clarifying the evolution of flavonoid metabolism in each banana group
