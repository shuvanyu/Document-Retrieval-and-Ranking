cranberries vaccinium macrocarpon aitare an excellent dietary source of phytochemicals that include flavonol glycosides anthocyanins proanthocyanidins condensed tannins and organic and phenolic acidsusing c18 and sephadex lipophilic lh20 column chromatography hplc and tandem lcesms the total cranberry extract tce has been analyzed quantified and separated into fractions enriched in sugars organic acids total polyphenols proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins 394 300 106 55 and 12 composition respectivelyusing a luminescent atp cell viability assay the antiproliferative effects of tce 200 microgml versus all fractions were evaluated against human oral kb cal27 colon ht29 hct116 sw480 sw620 and prostate rwpe1 rwpe2 22rv1 cancer cell linesthe total polyphenol fraction was the most active fraction against all cell lines with 961 and 95 inhibition of kb and cal27 oral cancer cells respectivelyfor the colon cancer cells the antiproliferative activity of this fraction was greater against hct116 921 than against ht29 611 sw480 60 and sw620 63tce and all fractions showed 50 antiproliferative activity against prostate cancer cells with total polyphenols being the most active fraction rwpe1 95 rwpe2 95 22rv1 996cranberry sugars 788 microgml did not inhibit the proliferation of any cancer cell linesthe enhanced antiproliferative activity of total polyphenols compared to tce and its individual phytochemicals suggests synergistic or additive antiproliferative interactions of the anthocyanins proanthocyanidins and flavonol glycosides within the cranberry extract
