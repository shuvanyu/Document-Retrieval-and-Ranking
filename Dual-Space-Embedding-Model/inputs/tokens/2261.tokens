background comparisons of the cost of different foods relative to their energy and nutritive value were conducted in the 1800s by the us department of agriculture usdaobjective the objective was to reestablish the relations between food cost energy and nutrients by using contemporary nutrient composition and food prices data from the usdadesign the usda food and nutrient database for dietary studies 10 fndds 10 and the center for nutrition policy and promotion food prices database were used for analysisfor 1387 foods key variables were as follows energy density kcalg serving size g unit price 100 g serving price serving and energy cost kcala regression model tested associations between nutrients and unit price 100 gcomparisons between food groups were tested by using onefactor analyses of variancerelations between energy density and price within food groups were tested by using spearmans correlationsresults grains and fats food groups supplied the lowestcost dietary energythe energy cost for vegetables was higher than that for any other food group except for fruitserving sizes increased with water content and varied inversely with energy density of foodsthe highest prices per serving were for meats poultry and fish and the lowest prices per serving were for the fats categoryalthough carbohydrates sugar and fat were associated with lower price per 100 g protein fiber vitamins and minerals were associated with higher price per 100 g after adjustment for energyconclusions grains and sugars food groups were cheaper than vegetables and fruit per calorie and were cheaper than fruit per servingthese price differentials may help to explain why lowcost energydense foods that are nutrient poor are associated with lower education and incomes
