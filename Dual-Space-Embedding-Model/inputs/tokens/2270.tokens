metabolomics studies hold promise for discovery of pathways linked to disease processescardiovascular disease cvd represents the leading cause of death and morbidity worldwidea metabolomics approach was used to generate unbiased small molecule metabolic profiles in plasma that predict risk for cvdthree metabolites of the dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine namely choline trimethylamine noxide tmao and betaine were identified and then shown to predict risk for cvd in an independent large clinical cohortdietary supplementation of mice with choline tmao or betaine promoted upregulation of multiple macrophage scavenger receptors linked to atherosclerosis and supplementation with choline or tmao promoted atherosclerosisstudies using germfree mice confirmed a critical role for dietary choline and gut flora in tmao production augmented macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formationsuppression of intestinal microflora in atherosclerosisprone mice inhibited dietary cholineenhanced atherosclerosisgenetic variations controlling expression of flavin monooxygenases fmos an enzymatic source of tmao segregated with atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic micediscovery of a relationship between gut floradependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine and cvd pathogenesis provides opportunities for development of both novel diagnostic tests and therapeutic approaches for atherosclerotic heart disease
