objective to test the hypothesis that a lowfat vegetarian diet reduces dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms by its effect on serum sexhormone binding globulin concentration and estrogen activitymethods in a crossover design 33 women followed a lowfat vegetarian diet for two menstrual cyclesfor two additional cycles they followed their customary diet while taking a supplement placebo pilldietary intake serum sexhormone binding globulin concentration body weight pain duration and intensity and premenstrual symptoms were assessed during each study phaseresults mean  standard deviation sd serum sexhormone binding globulin concentration was higher during the diet phase 467  236 nmoll than during the supplement phase 393  198 nmoll p  001mean  sd body weight was lower during the diet 661  113 kg compared with the supplement phase 679  121 kg p  001mean dysmenorrhea duration fell significantly from baseline 39  17 days to diet phase 27  19 days compared with change from baseline to supplement phase 36  17 days p  01pain intensity fell significantly during the diet phase compared with baseline for the worst secondworst and thirdworst days and mean durations of premenstrual concentration behavioral change and water retention symptoms were reduced significantly compared with the supplement phaseconclusion a lowfat vegetarian diet was associated with increased serum sexhormone binding globulin concentration and reductions in body weight dysmenorrhea duration and intensity and premenstrual symptom durationthe symptom effects might be mediated by dietary influences on estrogen activity
