background cellulite which appears as orange peeltype or cottage cheeselike dimpling of the skin on the thighs and buttocks is a complex multifactorial cosmetic disorder of the subcutaneous fat layer and the overlying superficial skinadiponectin is an adipocytederived hormone mainly produced by subcutaneous fat that shows important protective antiinflammatory and vasodilatory effectswe hypothesized that adiponectin expressed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue sat might play a role in the pathogenesis of cellulitewe reasoned that a reduction in the expression of adiponectin  a humoral vasodilator  in the sat of cellulite areas might contribute to the altered microcirculation frequently found in these regionsmethods a total of 15 lean body mass index bmi  25 kgm2  women with cellulite and 15 age and bmimatched women without cellulite participated in this studyrealtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr was used to assess adiponectin gene expressionplasma adiponectin levels were measured using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kitresults adiponectin mrna expression in the sat of the gluteal region was significantly lower in areas with cellulite compared with those without 126  31 au versus 166  41 au p0006however plasma adiponectin levels did not differ between women with 203  73 μgml and without 193  61 μgml cellulite p069conclusions adiponectin expression is significantly reduced in the sat in areas affected by celluliteour findings provide novel insights into the nature of cellulite and may give clues to the treatment of this cosmetic issue 2011 the international society of dermatology
