background a single highfat meal induces endothelial activation which is associated with increased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokinesobjective we compared the effect of 3 different meals on circulating concentrations of interleukin 8 il8 interleukin 18 il18 and adiponectin in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitusdesign thirty patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 30 matched nondiabetic subjects received the following 3 isoenergetic 780 kcal meals separated by 1wk intervals a highfat meal a highcarbohydrate lowfiber 45 g meal and a highcarbohydrate highfiber meal in which refinedwheat flour was replaced with wholewheat flour 168 gwe analyzed serum glucose and lipid variables and serum il8 il18 and adiponectin concentrations at baseline and at 2 and 4 h after ingestion of the mealsresults compared with nondiabetic subjects diabetic patients had higher fasting il8 p  005 and il18 p  001 concentrations and lower adiponectin concentrations p  001 at baselinein both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects il18 concentrations increased and adiponectin concentrations decreased p  005 from baseline concentrations after consumption of the highfat mealafter consumption of the highcarbohydrate highfiber meal serum il18 concentrations decreased from baseline concentrations p  005 in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects adiponectin concentrations decreased after the highcarbohydrate lowfiber meal in diabetic patientsil8 concentrations did not change significantly after consumption of any of the 3 mealsconclusions this study provides evidence that circulating il18 and adiponectin concentrations are modulated by familiar foodstuffs in humansmeal modulation of cytokines involved in atherogenesis may represent a safe strategy for ameliorating atherogenetic inflammatory activity in diabetic patients
