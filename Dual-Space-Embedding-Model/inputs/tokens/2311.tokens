preclinical and correlative studies suggest reduced breast cancer with higher lignan intake or blood levelswe conducted a pilot study of modulation of risk biomarkers for breast cancer in premenopausal women after administration of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol given as the diglycoside sdgeligibility criteria included regular menstrual cycles no oral contraceptives a greater than 3fold increase in 5 year risk and baseline ki67 2 in areas of hyperplasia in breast tissue sampled by random periareolar fine needle aspiration rpfna during the follicular phase of the menstrual cyclesdg 50 mg daily was given for 12 months followed by repeat rpfnathe primary endpoint was change in ki67secondary endpoints included change in cytomorphology mammographic breast density serum bioavailable estradiol and testosterone igfi and igfbp3 and plasma lignan levelsfortyfive of 49 eligible women completed the study with excellent compliance median  96 and few serious side effects 4 grade 3median plasma enterolactone increased  9fold and total lignans 16 foldthirtysix 80 of the 45 evaluable subjects demonstrated a decrease in ki67 from a median of 4 range 2168  to 2 range 0152 p0001 by wilcoxon signed rank testa decrease from baseline in the proportion of women with atypical cytology p0035 was also observedbased on favorable risk biomarker modulation and lack of adverse events we are initiating a randomized trial of sdg vs placebo in premenopausal women
