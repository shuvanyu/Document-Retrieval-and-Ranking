the incidence of breast cancer is increasing in the western world and there is an urgent need for studies of the mechanisms of sex steroids in order to develop novel preventive strategiesdiet modifications may be among the means for breast cancer preventionangiogenesis key in tumor progression is regulated by the balance between pro and antiangiogenic factors which are controlled in the extracellular spacesampling of these molecules at their bioactive compartment is therefore neededthe aims of this study were to explore if tamoxifen one of the most used antiestrogen treatments for breast cancer affected some of the most important endogenous angiogenesis regulators vascular endothelial growth factor vegf angiogenin and endostatin in normal breast tissue in vivo and if a diet supplementation with flaxseed had similar effects as tamoxifen in the breastmicrodialysis was used for in situ sampling of extracellular proteins in normal breast tissue of women before and after six weeks of tamoxifen treatment or before and after addition of 25 gday of ground flaxseed to the diet or in control womenwe show significant correlations between estradiol and levels of vegf angiogenin and endostatin in vivo which was verified in ex vivo breast tissue culturemoreover tamoxifen decreased the levels of vegf and angiogenin in the breast whereas endostatin increased significantlyflaxseed did not alter vegf or angiogenin levels but similar to tamoxifen the levels of endostatin increased significantlywe conclude that one of the mechanisms of tamoxifen in normal breast tissue include tipping of the angiogenic balance into an antiangiogenic state and that flaxseed has limited effects on the proangiogenic factors whereas the antiangiogenic endostatin may be modified by dietfurther studies of diet modifications for breast cancer prevention are warranted
