the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol which are produced by the microflora in the colon of humans and animals from precursors in foods have been suggested to have potential anticancer effectsthis study determined the production of mammalian lignans from precursors in food bars containing 25 g unground whole flaxseed fb sesame seed sb or their combination fsb 125 g eachin a randomized crossover study healthy postmenopausal women supplemented their diets with the bars for 4 wk each separated by 4wk washout periods and urinary mammalian lignan excretion was measured at baseline and after 4 wk as a marker of mammalian lignan productionresults showed an increase with all treatments 651810 mumolday p  00001 which did not differ among treatmentslignan excretion with the whole flaxseed was similar to results of other studies using ground flaxseedan unidentified lignan metabolite was detected after consumption of sb and fsb but not of fbthus we demonstrated for the first time that 1 precursors from unground whole flaxseed and sesame seed are converted by the bacterial flora in the colon to mammalian lignans and 2 sesame seed alone and in combination with flaxseed produces mammalian lignans equivalent to those obtained from flaxseed alone
