purpose phytoestrogens are plantderived nonsteroidal phytochemicals with anticarcinogenic potentialthe major structural classes are the isoflavones and lignansthe aim of this study was to compare the effect of the plantderived lignans secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol with the human lignans enterodiol and enterolactone as well as with 17β estradiol and tamoxifen on cell proliferation of breast carcinoma cell linesmethods the influence of the lignans 17β estradiol and tamoxifen on cell proliferation was determined using the brdu test in mcf 7 and bt 20 cell linesresults enterodiol and enterolactone induced a stronger inhibition of cell growth in mcf 7 and bt 20 cells than secoisolariciresinol and matairesinolthe inhibition effects were less expressed in the bt 20 than in the mcf 7 cellsconclusions the human lignans enterodiol and enterolactone are more biologically active than their precursors secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol and may be defined as the real drugs in cancer prevention
