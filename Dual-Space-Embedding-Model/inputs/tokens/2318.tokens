low lignan status has been reported to be related to an elevated risk of breast cancersince lignan status is reduced by antibacterial medications it is plausible to hypothesize that repeated use of antibiotics may also be a risk factor for breast cancerhistory of treatment for urinary tract infection was studied for its prediction of breast cancer among 9461 finnish women 1989 years of age and initially cancerfreeduring a followup in 19731991 a total of 157 breast cancer cases were diagnosedwomen reporting previous or present medication for urinary tract infection at baseline showed an elevated breast cancer risk in comparison with other womenthe ageadjusted relative risk was 134 95 confidence interval ci  098183the association was concentrated to women under 50 years of agethe relative risk for these women was 174 95 ci 113268 whereas it was 097 95 ci 059158 for older womenthe relative risk in the younger agegroup was 147 95 ci 073297 during the first 10 years of followup and 193 95 ci 111337 for followup times longer than 10 yearsthese data suggest that premenopausal women using longterm medication for urinary tract infections show a possible elevated risk of future breast cancerthe results are however still inconclusive and the hypothesis needs to be tested by other studies 2000 cancer researchcampaign
