we previously demonstrated that high serum enterolactone levels are associated with a reduced incidence of breast cancer in healthy womenthe present study was aimed at investigating whether a similar association might be found between serum enterolactone levels and the mortality of women with early breast cancerthe levels of enterolactone in cryopreserved serum aliquots obtained from 300 patients operated on for breast cancer were measured using a timeresolved fluoroimmunoassaylevels were analyzed in respect to the risk of mortality following surgerycox proportional hazard regression models were used to check for prognostic features to estimate hazard ratios for group comparisons and to test for the interaction on mortality hazards between the variables and enterolactone concentrationsthe fine and gray competing risk proportional hazard regression model was used to predict the probabilities of breast cancerrelated and breast cancerunrelated mortalitiesat a median followup time of 23 years range 06261 180 patients died 112 of whom died due to breast cancerrelated eventsan association between a decreased mortality risk and enterolactone levels  10 nmoll was found in respect to both allcause and breast cancerspecific mortalitythe difference in mortality hazards was statistically significant but it appeared to decrease and to lose significance after the first 10 years though competing risk analysis showed that breast cancerrelated mortality risk remained constantly lower in those patients with higher enterolactone levelsour findings are consistent with those of most recent literature and provide further evidence that mammalian lignans might play an important role in reducing allcause and cancerspecific mortality of the patients operated on for breast cancer
