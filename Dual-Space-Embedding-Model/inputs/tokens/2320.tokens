a hplc method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside sdg and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flourdirect extraction by 1 m naoh for 1 h at 20 degrees c resulted in a higher yield than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extractsan internal standard ocoumaric acid was used and the method was found to be easy fast and with good repeatabilityon dry matter basis different samples of flaxseeds varied considerably in their content of sdg 119259 mgg sdg 2250 mgg pcoumaric acid glucoside 1285 mgg and ferulic acid glucoside 1650 mgg
