the regular occurrence of a peak due to an unidentified substance x in the gas chromatographic traces obtained from phenolic extracts of urine from human pregnant and nonpregnant females has been reportedthe biphasic excretion of x with maxima in the luteal phase of the ovulatory cycle and relatively high levels in the first trimester of pregnancy were noteworthy and suggested that the substance may have a biological significanceclose similarities between the excretory pattern the chemical and chromatographic properties of x and of those of the known phenolic steroids suggested initially that this compound was steroidal in naturethe same or a similar substance seems to be excreted in the vervet monkey cercopithecus aethiops pygerythruswe now report the excretory pattern of x in more detail the isolation of the pure compound from pooled pregnancy urine and the chemical structurethe structure determined by mass spectrometry ir spectroscopy and nmr spectrometry is trans34bis3hydroxyphenylmethyldihydro23hfuranone hpmf and was confirmed by synthesis
