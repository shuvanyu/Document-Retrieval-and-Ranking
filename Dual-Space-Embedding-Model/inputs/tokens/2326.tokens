purpose lignansplantderived compounds with estrogendependent and independent anticarcinogenic propertieshave been associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk but data are limited regarding their effect on survivaldietary lignans are metabolized to enterolignans which are subsequently absorbed and become bioavailablepatients and methods we assessed the prognosis of 1140 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer age 50 to 74 years who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2005vital status through the end of 2009 was ascertained via local population registries and deaths were verified by death certificatesinformation on recurrences and secondary tumors was verified by clinical records and attending physiciansassociations of postdiagnostic serum enterolactone a biomarker for dietary lignans with overall survival and distant diseasefree survival were assessed by using cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic factorsresults median enterolactone levels for deceased patients and those still alive were 170 and 214 nmoll respectivelyduring a median of 61 years of followup after diagnosis 162 deaths were confirmedhigher serum enterolactone levels were associated with significantly reduced hazard ratios hrs for death hr per 10 nmoll increment 094 p  04 hr for the highest quartile 058 95 ci 034 to 099for distant disease hr was 094 per 10 nmoll increment p  08 and 062 95 ci 035 to 109 for the highest quartilethe highest quartile of serum enterolactone was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death only for estrogen receptornegative tumors hr 027 95 ci 008 to 087 but not for estrogen receptorpositive tumors hr 091 95 ci 045 to 184 p for heterogeneity  09conclusion postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have high serum enterolactone levels may have better survival
