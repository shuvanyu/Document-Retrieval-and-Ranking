background lignans  oestrogenic substances present in various foods  are associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk but not much is known regarding their effects on survivalmethods in a followup study of 2653 postmenopausal breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 vital status and causes of death were verified through end of 2009hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals cis for estimated enterolignans lignanrich foods and dietary fibre in relation to overall survival os and breast cancerspecific survival bcss were assessed using cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognosticconfounding factorsresults median followup time was 64 years and 321 women died 235 with breast cancerhigh estimated enterolactone and enterodiol levels were associated with significantly lower overall mortality highest quintile hr060 95 ci040089 ptrend002 and hr063 95 ci042095 ptrend002 respectivelyfibre intake was also associated with a significantly lower overall mortalitydifferentiated by median fibre intake associations with estimated enterolignans were still evident at low but not high fibre intakethere was no effect modification by oestrogen receptor status and menopausal hormone therapyconclusion postmenopausal breast cancer patients with high estimated enterolignans may have a better survival
