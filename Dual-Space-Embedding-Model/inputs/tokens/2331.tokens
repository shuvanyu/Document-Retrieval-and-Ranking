background observational and preclinical studies suggest that dietary fiber intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer but the results are inconclusiveobjective we aimed to examine the association between dietary fiber intake and risk of breast cancer by conducting a metaanalysis of prospective cohort studiesdesign relevant studies were identified by a pubmed database search through january 2011reference lists from retrieved articles were also reviewedwe included prospective cohort studies that reported rrs with 95 cis for the association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer riskboth fixed and randomeffects models were used to calculate the summary risk estimatesresults we identified 10 prospective cohort studies of dietary fiber intake and risk of breast cancer involving 16848 cases and 712195 participantsthe combined rr of breast cancer for the highest compared with the lowest dietary fiber intake was 089 95 ci 083 096 and little evidence of heterogeneity was observedthe association between dietary fiber intake and risk of breast cancer did not significantly differ by geographic region length of followup or menopausal status of the participantsomission of any single study had little effect on the combined risk estimatedoseresponse analysis showed that every 10gd increment in dietary fiber intake was associated with a significant 7 reduction in breast cancer risklittle evidence of publication bias was foundconclusion this metaanalysis provides evidence of a significant inverse doseresponse association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk
