we conducted a combined analysis of the original data to evaluate the consistency of 12 casecontrol studies of diet and breast cancerour analysis shows a consistent statistically significant positive association between breast cancer risk and saturated fat intake in postmenopausal women relative risk for highest vs lowest quintile 146 p less than 0001a consistent protective effect for a number of markers of fruit and vegetable intake was demonstrated vitamin c intake had the most consistent and statistically significant inverse association with breast cancer risk relative risk for highest vs lowest quintile 069 p less than 0001if these dietary associations represent causality the attributable risk ie the percentage of breast cancers that might be prevented by dietary modification in the north american population is estimated to be 24 for postmenopausal women and 16 for premenopausal women
