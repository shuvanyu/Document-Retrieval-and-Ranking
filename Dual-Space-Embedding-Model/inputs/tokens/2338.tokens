although high alphalinolenic acid flaxseed linum usitatissimum is one of the richest dietary sources of alphalinolenic acid and is also a good source of soluble fibre mucilage it is relatively unstudied in human nutritionhealthy female volunteers consumed 50 g ground raw flaxseedd for 4 weeks which provided 1213 of energy intake 2425 g100 g total fatflaxseed raised alphalinolenic acid and longchain n3 fatty acids in both plasma and erythrocyte lipids as well as raising urinary thiocyanate excretion 22foldflaxseed also lowered serum total cholesterol by 9 and lowdensitylipoproteincholesterol by 18changes in plasma alphalinolenic acid were equivalent when 12 g alphalinolenic acidd was provided as raw flaxseed flour 50 gd or flaxseed oil 20 gd suggesting high bioavailability of alphalinolenic acid from ground flaxseedtest meals containing 50 g carbohydrate from flaxseed or 25 g flaxseed mucilage each significantly decreased postprandial blood glucose responses by 27malondialdehyde levels in muffins containing 15 g flaxseed oil or flourkg were similar to those in wheatflour muffinscyanogenic glycosides linamarin linustatin neolinustatin were highest in extracted flaxseed mucilage but were not detected in baked muffins containing 150 g flaxseedkgwe conclude that up to 50 g highalphalinolenic acid flaxseedd is palatable safe and may be nutritionally beneficial in humans by raising n3 fatty acids in plasma and erythrocytes and by decreasing postprandial glucose responses
