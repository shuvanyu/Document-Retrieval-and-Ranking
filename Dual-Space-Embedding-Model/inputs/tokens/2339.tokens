objective to determine the effects of dietary consumption of milled flaxseed or flaxseed oil on glycemic control n3 fatty acid status anthropometrics and adipokines in individuals with type 2 diabetesdesign thirtyfour participants were randomized into a parallel controlled trialsubjects the participants were adults with type 2 diabetes age 524  15 years body mass index 324  10 kgm2 n  17 men and 17 womeninterventions participants consumed a selection of bakery products containing no flax control group ctl n  9 milled flaxseed fxs n  13 32 gd or flaxseed oil fxo n  12 13 gd daily for 12 weeksthe fxs and fxo groups received equivalent amounts of alphalinolenic acid ala 74 gdaymeasures of outcome the primary outcome measures were fasting plasma hemoglobin a1c glucose insulin and phospholipid fatty acid compositionthe secondary outcome measures were fasting circulating leptin and adiponectin as well as body weight body mass index and waist circumferencedietary intake assessment and calculations for homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and quantified insulin sensitivity check were also completedresults the fxs and fxo groups had increases in plasma phospholipid n3 fatty acids ala eicosapentaenoic acid epa or decosapentaenoic acid dpa but not docosahexaenoic acid and the fxo group had more epa and dpa in plasma phospholipids compared to the fxs groupall groups had similar caloric intakes however the ctl group experienced a 4 weight gain compared to baseline p  005 while both flax groups had constant body weights during the study periodall other parameters including glycemic control were unchanged by dietary treatmentconclusions milled fxs and fxo intake does not affect glycemic control in adults with wellcontrolled type 2 diabetespossible prevention of weight gain by flax consumption warrants further investigation
