background mammalian lignans enterolactone el and enterodiol ed have been shown to inhibit breast and colon carcinomato date there have been no reports of the effect of lignans on prostatic carcinomawe investigated the effects of ed and el on three human prostate cancer cell lines pc3 du145 and lncapmaterials and methods cells were treated with either 01 vv dmso vehicle or 10100 microm of el ed or genistein positive control for 72 hourscell viability was measured by the propidium iodide nuclei staining fluorometric assay with each assay performed in triplicateresults at 10100 microm el significantly inhibited the growth of all cell lines whereas ed only inhibited pc3 and lncap cellswhile el was a more potent growth inhibitor than ed both were less potent than genisteinthe dose for 50 growth inhibition of lncap cells ic50 by el was 57 microm whereas ic50 was 100 microm for ed the observed ic50 for genistein was 25 micromconclusion ed and el suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells and may do so via hormonallydependent and independent mechanisms
