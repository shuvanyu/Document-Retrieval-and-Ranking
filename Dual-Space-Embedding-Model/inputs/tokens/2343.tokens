background chinese men have lower incidences of prostate cancer compared to men from europe and north americaasians consume large quantities of soya a rich source of isoflavanoids phytooestrogens and have high plasma and urinary levels of these compoundsthe mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol are another group of weak plant oestrogens and are derived from seeds cereals and grainsvegetarians have high plasma and urinary concentrations of lignansmethods the concentrations lignans and isoflavonic phytooestrogens were determined by gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms in plasma and prostatic fluid from portuguese chinese and british men consuming their traditional dietsresults in prostatic fluid the mean concentrations of enterolactone were 31 162 and 203 ngml for hong kong portugal and britain respectivelyvery high levels of enterolactone  600 ngml were observed in the prostatic fluid of some of the men from portugalhigh concentrations of equol 3270 ngml and daidzein 532 ngml were found in a sample of prostatic fluid from hong konghigher mean levels of daidzein were observed in prostatic fluid from hong kong at 70 ngml compared to 46 and 113 ngml in samples from portugal and britain respectivelymean levels of daidzein were higher in the plasma samples from hong kong 313 ngml compared to those from portugal 13 ngml and britain 82 ngmlin general the mean plasma concentrations of enterolactone from the three centres were similar at 62 39 and 39 ngml in samples from hong kong portugal and britain respectivelyconclusions higher concentrations of the isoflavanoid phytooestrogens daidzein and equol were found in the plasma and prostatic fluid of men from hong kong compared to those from britain and portugalhowever the levels of the lignan enterolactone were very much higher in prostatic fluid of portuguese menisoflavanoids and lignans have many interesting properties and may in part be responsible for lower incidences of prostate cancer in men from asia and also some mediterranean countriesthe isoflavanoids from soya which are present in high concentrations in the prostatic fluid of asian men may be protective against prostate disease
