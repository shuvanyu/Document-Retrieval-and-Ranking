diet nutritional status and certain dietary supplements are postulated to influence the development and progression of prostate cancerangiogenesis and inflammation are central to tumor growth and progression but the effect of diet on these processes remains uncertainwe explored changes in 50 plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors cafs in 145 men with prostate cancer enrolled in a preoperative randomized controlled phaseii trial with four arms control usual diet lowfat lf diet flaxseedsupplemented fs diet and flaxseedsupplemented lowfat dietthe mean duration of dietary intervention was 3031 daysamong the individual arms the largest number of significant changes baseline vs preoperative followup was observed in the lf arm with 19 cafs decreasing and one increasing p05compared to the control arm 6 cafsincluding proangiogenic factors stromalcell derived1α and myeloid factors granulocytecolonystimulating factor macrophage colonystimulating factor  all decreased in the lf arm compared to controls 3 and 4 cafs changed in the fs and fslf arms respectivelyweight loss occurred in the lf arms and significantly correlated with vegf decreases p 0001the cafs that changed in the lf arm are all known to be regulated by nuclear factorkappa b nfκb and a pathway analysis identified nfκb as the most likely regulatory network associated with these changes in the lf arm but not in the fscontaining armsthese results suggest that a lowfat diet without flaxseed may reduce levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors and suggests that the nfκb pathway may be a mediator of these changes
