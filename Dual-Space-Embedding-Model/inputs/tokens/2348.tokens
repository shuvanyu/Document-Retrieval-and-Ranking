microbes have evolved over 35 billion years and are arguably the most adaptable organisms on earthrestricted genetically by their inability to reproduce sexually bacteria have acquired several additional mechanisms by which to exchange genetic material horizontallysuch mechanisms have allowed bacteria to inhabit some of the most inhospitable environments on earthit is thus hardly surprising that when faced with a barrage of inimical chemicals antibiotics they have responded with an equal and opposite forcethis article compares and contrasts the evolution of antimicrobial resistance to betalactam antibiotics over the last 70 years in two bacterial species namely staphylococcus aureus a highly evolved human pathogen and pseudomonas aeruginosa an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen
