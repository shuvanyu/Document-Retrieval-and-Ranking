the treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agentsantimicrobial agents are often categorized according to their principal mechanism of actionmechanisms include interference with cell wall synthesis eg betalactams and glycopeptide agents inhibition of protein synthesis macrolides and tetracyclines interference with nucleic acid synthesis fluoroquinolones and rifampin inhibition of a metabolic pathway trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and disruption of bacterial membrane structure polymyxins and daptomycinbacteria may be intrinsically resistant to  or 1 class of antimicrobial agents or may acquire resistance by de novo mutation or via the acquisition of resistance genes from other organismsacquired resistance genes may enable a bacterium to produce enzymes that destroy the antibacterial drug to express efflux systems that prevent the drug from reaching its intracellular target to modify the drugs target site or to produce an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the action of the drugacquisition of new genetic material by antimicrobialsusceptible bacteria from resistant strains of bacteria may occur through conjugation transformation or transduction with transposons often facilitating the incorporation of the multiple resistance genes into the hosts genome or plasmidsuse of antibacterial agents creates selective pressure for the emergence of resistant strainsherein 3 case historiesone involving escherichia coli resistance to thirdgeneration cephalosporins another focusing on the emergence of vancomycinresistant staphylococcus aureus and a third detailing multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosaare reviewed to illustrate the varied ways in which resistant bacteria develop
