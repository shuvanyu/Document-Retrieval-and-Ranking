the connection between farmgenerated animal waste and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities via mobile genetic elements remains obscurein this study electromagnetic induction emi surveying of a broiler chicken farm assisted soil sampling from a chickenwasteimpacted site and a marginally affected siteconsistent with the emi survey a disparity existed between the two sites with regard to soil ph tetracycline resistance tcr levels among culturable soil bacteria and the incidence and prevalence of several tet and erm genes in the soilsno significant difference was observed in these aspects between the marginally affected site and several sites in a relatively pristine regional forestwhen the farm was in operation tetl tetm teto erma ermb and ermc genes were detected in the wasteaffected soiltwo years after all waste was removed from the farm tetl tetm teto and ermc genes were still detectedthe abundances of tetl teto and ermb were measured using quantitative pcr and the copy numbers of each were normalized to eubacterial 16s rrna gene copy numberstetl was the most prevalent gene whereas teto was the most persistent although all declined over the 2year perioda mobilizable plasmid carrying tetl was identified in seven of 14 tcr soil isolatesthe plasmids hosts were identified as species of bhargavaea sporosarcina and bacillusthe plasmids mobilization mob gene was quantified to estimate its prevalence in the soil and the ratio of tetl to mob was shown to have changed from 341 to 11 over the 2year sampling period
