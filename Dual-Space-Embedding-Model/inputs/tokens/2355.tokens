escherichia coli isolates were recovered from the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system retail meat program and examined for antimicrobial susceptibilityretail meat samples n  11921 from four us states collected during 2002 to 2008 consisting of 2988 chicken breast 2942 ground turkey 2991 ground beef and 3000 pork chop samples were analyzeda total of 8286 e coli isolates were recoveredthe greatest numbers of samples contaminated with the organism were chicken 835 and turkey 820 followed by beef 689 and pork 440resistance was most common to tetracycline 503 followed by streptomycin 346 sulfamethoxazolesulfisoxazole 316 ampicillin 225 gentamicin 186 kanamycin 84 amoxicillinclavulanic acid 64 and cefoxitin 52less than 5 of the isolates had resistance to trimethoprim ceftriaxone ceftiofur nalidixic acid chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacinall isolates were susceptible to amikacincompared to beef and pork isolates the poultry meat isolates had a greater percentage of resistance to all tested drugs with the exception of chloramphenicol to which pork isolates had the most resistancemore than half of the turkey isolates 56 were resistant to multidrugs 3 classes compared to 389 of chicken 173 of pork and 93 of beef isolatesthe blacmy gene was present in all ceftriaxone and ceftiofurresistant isolatesthe cmla flo and cati genes were present in 45 43 and 40 of chloramphenicolresistant isolates respectivelymost nalidixic acidresistant isolates 985 had a gyra mutation in s83 or d87 or both whereas only 67 had a parc mutation in either s80 or e84the results showed that e coli was commonly present in the retail meats and antimicrobial resistance profiles differed according to the animal origin of the isolates
