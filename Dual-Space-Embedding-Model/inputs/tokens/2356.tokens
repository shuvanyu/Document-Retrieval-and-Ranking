mathematical models that estimate the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to food commodities at specific points in the food chain may be useful to risk managers and policy makers to formulate public health goals prioritize interventions and document the effectiveness of mitigations aimed at reducing illnessusing human surveillance data on laboratoryconfirmed salmonella infections from the centers for disease control and prevention and salmonella testing data from us department of agriculture food safety and inspection services regulatory programs we developed a pointofprocessing foodborne illness attribution model by adapting the hald salmonella bayesian source attribution modelkey model outputs include estimates of the relative proportions of domestically acquired sporadic human salmonella infections resulting from contamination of raw meat poultry and egg products processed in the united states from 1998 through 2003the current model estimates the relative contribution of chicken 48 ground beef 28 turkey 17 egg products 6 intact beef 1 and pork 1 across 109 salmonella serotypes found in food commodities at point of processingwhile interpretation of the attribution estimates is constrained by data inputs the adapted model shows promise and may serve as a basis for a common approach to attribution of human salmonellosis and food safety decisionmaking in more than one country
