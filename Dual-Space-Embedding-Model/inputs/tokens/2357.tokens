seven cyclists exercised at 70 of maximal o2 uptake vo2max until fatigue 170  9 min on three occasions 1 wk apartduring these trials plasma glucose declined from 50  01 to 31  01 mm p less than 0001 and respiratory exchange ratio r fell from 087  001 to 081  001 p less than 0001after resting 20 min the subjects attempted to continue exercise either 1 after ingesting a placebo 2 after ingesting glucose polymers 3 gkg or 3 when glucose was infused intravenously euglycemic clampplacebo ingestion did not restore euglycemia or r plasma glucose increased p less than 0001 initially to approximately 5 mm and r rose p less than 0001 to approximately 083 with glucose infusion or carbohydrate ingestionplasma glucose and r then fell gradually to 39  03 mm and 081  001 respectively after carbohydrate ingestion but were maintained at 51  01 mm and 083  001 respectively by glucose infusiontime to fatigue during this second exercise bout was significantly longer during the carbohydrate ingestion 26  4 min p less than 005 or glucose infusion 43  5 min p less than 001 trials compared with the placebo trial 10  1 minplasma insulin approximately 10 microuml and vastus lateralis muscle glycogen approximately 40 mmol glucosyl ukg did not change during glucose infusion with threefourths of total carbohydrate oxidation during the second exercise bout accounted for by the euglycemic glucose infusion rate 113  008 gminabstract truncated at 250 words
