research suggests that preexercise sources of dietary carbohydrate with varying glycemic indexes may differentially affect metabolism and endurancethis study was designed to examine potential differences in metabolism and cycling performance after consumption of moderate glycemic raisins vs a high glycemic commercial sports geleight endurancetrained male n  4 and female n  4 cyclists 30  5 years of age completed 2 trials in random ordersubjects were fed 1 g carbohydrate per kilogram body weight from either raisins or sports gel 45 minutes prior to exercise on a cycle ergometer at 70 vo2maxafter 45 minutes of submaximal exercise subjects completed a 15minute performance trialblood was collected prior to the exercise bout as well as after the 45th minute of exercise to determine serum concentrations of glucose insulin lactate free fatty acids ffas triglycerides and betahydroxybutyrateperformance was not different p  005 between the raisin 1895  699 kj and gel 1880  648 kj trialsprior to exercise serum concentrations of glucose and other fuel substrates did not differ between trials however insulin was higher p  005 for the gel 1100  704 microu x ml1 vs raisin trial 614  374 microu x ml1after 45 minutes of exercise insulin decreased to 142  62 microu x ml1 and 133  189 microu x ml1 for gel and raisin trials respectivelythe ffa concentration increased 02  01 mmol x l1 significantly p  005 during the raisin trialoverall minor differences in metabolism and no difference in performance were detected between the trialsraisins appear to be a costeffective source of carbohydrate for preexercise feeding in comparison to sports gel for shortterm exercise bouts
