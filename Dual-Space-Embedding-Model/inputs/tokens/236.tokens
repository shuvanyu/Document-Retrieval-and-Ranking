we examined effects of fiber on stool output since this is one of the primary mediating variables for the hypothesized relationship between fiber and diseasetotal neutral detergent fiber in the dietary fiber source was predictive of stool weight but not frequencysubstantial individual differences in stool output remained when dietary factors were controlledpersonality measures were used to predict stool weight and frequency independently of diet and accounted for about as much variance in stool output as did dietary fiberthese results suggest that personality factors predispose some persons to low stool outputthese individuals may benefit particularly from dietary fiber
