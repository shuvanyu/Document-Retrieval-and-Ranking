background this study was designed to determine the glycemic indices of five commonly used varieties of dates in healthy subjects and their effects on postprandial glucose excursions in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitusmethods composition analysis was carried out for five types of dates tamer stagethe weights of the flesh of the dates equivalent to 50 g of available carbohydrates were calculatedthe study subjects were thirteen healthy volunteers with a mean  sd age of 402  67 years and ten participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled on lifestyle measures andor metformin with a mean hba1c  sd of 66  07 and a mean age  sd of 408  57 yearseach subject was tested on eight separate days with 50 g of glucose on 3 occasions and 50 g equivalent of available carbohydrates from the 5 varieties of date each on one occasioncapillary glucose was measured in the healthy subjects at 0 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min and for the diabetics at 0 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 minthe glycemic indices were determined as ratios of the incremental areas under the response curves for the dates compared to glucosestatistical analyses were performed using the mannwhitney u test and repeated measures analysis of varianceresults mean glycemic indices  sem of the dates for the healthy individuals were 540  61 535  86 463  71 491  36 and 551  77 for farad lulu bo maan dabbas and khalas respectivelycorresponding values for those with type 2 diabetes were very similar 461  62 438  77 518  69 502  39 and 530  60there were no statistically significant differences in the gis between the control and the diabetic groups for the five types of dates nor were there statistically significant differences among the dates gis df  4 f  0365 p  083conclusion the results show low glycemic indices for the five types of dates included in the study and that their consumption by diabetic individuals does not result in significant postprandial glucose excursionsthese findings point to the potential benefits of dates for diabetic subjects when used in a healthy balanced diettrial registration number clinicaltrialsgov nct01307904
