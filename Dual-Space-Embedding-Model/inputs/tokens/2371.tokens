background to evaluate health benefits attributed to hibiscus sabdariffa l a randomized openlabel twoway crossover study was undertaken to compare the impact of an aqueous h sabdariffa l extract hse on the systemic antioxidant potential aop assayed by ferric reducing antioxidant power frap with a reference treatment water in eight healthy volunteersthe biokinetic variables were the areas under the curve auc of plasma frap ascorbic acid and urate that are above the predose concentration and the amounts excreted into urine within 24 h ae024  of antioxidants as assayed by frap ascorbic acid uric acid malondialdehyde biomarker for oxidative stress and hippuric acid metabolite and potential biomarker for total polyphenol intakeresults hse caused significantly higher plasma auc of frap an increase in ae024 of frap ascorbic acid and hippuric acid whereas malondialdehyde excretion was reducedfurthermore the main hibiscus anthocyanins as well as one glucuronide conjugate could be quantified in the volunteers urine 002 of the administered doseconclusion the aqueous hse investigated in this study enhanced the systemic aop and reduced the oxidative stress in humansfurthermore the increased urinary hippuric acid excretion after hse consumption indicates a high biotransformation of the ingested hse polyphenols most likely caused by the colonic microbiotacopyright  2012 society of chemical industry
