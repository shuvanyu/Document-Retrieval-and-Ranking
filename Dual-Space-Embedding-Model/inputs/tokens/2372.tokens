the aqueous extracts of hibiscus sabdariffa have been commonly used in folk medicinenevertheless the compounds or metabolites responsible for its healthy effects have not yet been identifiedthe major metabolites present in rat plasma after acute ingestion of a polyphenolenriched hibiscus sabdariffa extract were characterized and quantified in order to study their bioavailabilitythe antioxidant status of the plasma samples was also measured through several complementary antioxidant techniqueshighperformance liquid chromatography coupled to timeofflight mass spectrometry hplcesitofms was used for the bioavailability studythe antioxidant status was measured by ferric reducing ability of plasma method thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay and superoxide dismutase activity assayseventeen polyphenols and metabolites have been detected and quantifiedeleven of these compounds were metabolitesalthough phenolic acids were found in plasma without any modification in their structures most flavonols were found as quercetin or kaempferol glucuronide conjugatesflavonol glucuronide conjugates which show longer halflife elimination values are proposed to contribute to the observed lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity in the cellular membranesby contrast phenolic acids appear to exert their antioxidant activity through ferric ion reduction and superoxide scavenging at shorter timeswe propose that flavonolconjugated forms quercetin and kaempferol may be the compounds responsible for the observed antioxidant effects and contribute to the healthy effects of h sabdariffa polyphenolic extract 2012 wileyvch verlag gmbh  co kgaa weinheim
