sixteen parkinsonian patients with daily fluctuations in the clinical response to levodopa have been placed on a redistribution protein dietthe diet was virtually proteinfree until the evening meal and then unrestricted until bedtimewhile on the redistribution protein diet a group of patients 5 out of 16 had a clear and significant benefit from dietary therapy showing a definite reduction of diurnal motor performance fluctuationsin addition all patients tended to show an improvement and a more constant response to levodopa treatmenta trial of redistribution protein diet appears a simple reasonable worthwhile approach to pd patients who begin to experience oscillating clinical response to levodopa treatment
