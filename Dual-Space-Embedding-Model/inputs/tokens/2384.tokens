background parkinsons disease pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorderpeople with pd their families scientists health care providers and the general public are increasingly interested in identifying environmental contributors to pd riskmethods in june 2007 a multidisciplinary group of experts gathered in sunnyvale california usa to assess what is known about the contribution of environmental factors to pdresults we describe the conclusions around which they came to consensus with respect to environmental contributors to pd riskwe conclude with a brief summary of research needsconclusions pd is a complex disorder and multiple different pathogenic pathways and mechanisms can ultimately lead to pdwithin the individual there are many determinants of pd risk and within populations the causes of pd are heterogeneousalthough rare recognized genetic mutations are sufficient to cause pd these account for  10 of pd in the us population and incomplete penetrance suggests that environmental factors may be involvedindeed interplay among environmental factors and genetic makeup likely influences the risk of developing pdthere is a need for further understanding of how risk factors interact and studying pd is likely to increase understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders
