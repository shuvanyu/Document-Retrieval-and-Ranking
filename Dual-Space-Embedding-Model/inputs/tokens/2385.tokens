background exposure to pesticides has been reported to increase the risk of parkinson disease pd but identification of the specific pesticides is lackingthree studies have found elevated levels of organochlorine pesticides in postmortem pd brainsobjective to determine whether elevated levels of organochlorine pesticides are present in the serum of patients with pddesign casecontrol studysetting an academic medical centerparticipants fifty patients with pd 43 controls and 20 patients with alzheimer diseasemain outcome measures levels of 16 organochlorine pesticides in serum samplesresults βhexachlorocyclohexane βhch was more often detectable in patients with pd 76 compared with controls 40 and patients with alzheimer disease 30the median level of βhch was higher in patients with pd compared with controls and patients with alzheimer diseasethere were no marked differences in detection between controls and patients with pd concerning any of the other 15 organochlorine pesticidesfinally we observed a significant odds ratio for the presence of βhch in serum to predict a diagnosis of pd vs control odds ratio 439 95 confidence interval 167116 and pd vs alzheimer disease odds ratio 520 which provides further evidence for the apparent association between serum βhch and pdconclusions these data suggest that βhch is associated with a diagnosis of pdfurther research is warranted regarding the potential role of βhch as a etiologic agent for some cases of pd
