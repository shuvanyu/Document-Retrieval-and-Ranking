objective to determine whether evidence of neuronal dysfunction or demise preceded deposition of lewy pathology in vulnerable neurons in parkinson disease pdmethods we examined the extent of nigral dysfunction and degeneration among 63 normal incidental lewy body disease ilbd and pd cases based on tyrosine hydroxylase th immunoreactivity and neuron densities respectivelythe relationship between these markers and lewy pathology lp burden in the substantia nigra sn and braak pd stage was assessedresults compared with normal subjects ilbd cases displayed a significantly higher percentage of thnegative cells and lower neuronal densities in the sn as early as braak pd stages 1 and 2 before lp deposition in the nigrostriatal systemilbd nigral neuron densities were intermediate between normal subjects and pd cases and thnegative percentages were higher in ilbd than either normal or pd casesfurthermore neuron density and neuronal dysfunction levels remained relatively constant across braak pd stages in ilbdconclusions these results suggest that significant neurodegeneration and cellular dysfunction precede lp in the sn challenging the pathogenic role of lp in pd and the assumption that ilbd always represents preclinical pd
