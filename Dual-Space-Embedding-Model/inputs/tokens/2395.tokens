the fruit of euterpe oleraceae commonly known as acai has been demonstrated to exhibit significantly high antioxidant capacity in vitro especially for superoxide and peroxyl scavenging and therefore may have possible health benefitsin this study the antioxidant capacities of freezedried acai fruit pulpskin powder optiacai were evaluated by different assays with various free radical sourcesit was found to have exceptional activity against superoxide in the superoxide scavenging sod assay the highest of any food reported to date against the peroxyl radical as measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe oracfl and mild activity against both the peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical by the peroxynitrite averting capacity norac and hydroxyl radical averting capacity horac assays respectivelythe sod of acai was 1614 unitsg an extremely high scavenging capacity for o2 by far the highest of any fruit or vegetable tested to datetotal phenolics were also tested as comparisonin the total antioxidant tao assay antioxidants in acai were differentiated into slowacting and fastacting componentsan assay measuring inhibition of reactive oxygen species ros formation in freshly purified human neutrophils showed that antioxidants in acai are able to enter human cells in a fully functional form and to perform an oxygen quenching function at very low dosesfurthermore other bioactivities related to antiinflammation and immune functions were also investigatedacai was found to be a potential cyclooxygenase cox1 and cox2 inhibitorit also showed a weak effect on lipopolysaccharide lpsinduced nitric oxide but no effect on either lymphocyte proliferation and phagocytic capacity
