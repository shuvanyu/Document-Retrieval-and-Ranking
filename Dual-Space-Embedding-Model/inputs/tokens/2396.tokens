hibiscus sabdariffa linne malvaceae an attractive plant believed to be native to africa is cultivated in the sudan and eastern taiwananthocyanins exist widely in many vegetables and fruitssome reports demonstrated that anthocyanins extracted from h sabdariffa l hibiscus anthocyanins has which are a group of natural pigments existing in the dried calyx of h sabdariffa l exhibited antioxidant activity and liver protectiontherefore in this study we explored the effect of has on human cancer cellsthe result showed that has could cause cancer cell apoptosis especially in hl60 cellsusing flow cytometry we found that has treatment 04 mgml markedly induced apoptosis in hl60 cells in a dose and timedependent mannerthe result also revealed increased phosphorylation in p38 and cjun cytochrome c release and expression of tbid fas and fasl in the hastreated hl60 cellswe further used sb203580 p38 inhibitor pd98059 mek inhibitor sp600125 jnk inhibitor and wortmannin phosphatidylinositol 3kinase pi3k inhibitor to evaluate their effect on the hasinduced hl60 deaththe data showed that only sb203580 had strong potential in inhibiting hl60 cell apoptosis and related protein expression and phosphorylationtherefore we suggested that has mediated hl60 apoptosis via the p38fasl and bid pathwayaccording to these results has could be developed as chemopreventive agentshowever further investigations into the specificity and mechanisms of has are needed
