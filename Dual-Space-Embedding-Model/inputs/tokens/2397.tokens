in a prelminary communication we described the establishment of a continuous human myeloid cell line hl60here we report the detailed properties of this cell line and document its derivation from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemiaas characterized by light and electron microscopy the predominant cell type in both the fresh and cultured sources is a neutrophilic promyelocyte with prominent nuclearcytoplasmic asynchronyup to 10 of the cultured cells spontaneously differentiate beyond the promyelocyte stage and the proportion of terminally differentiated cells is markedly enhanced by compounds known to stimulate differentiation of mouse friend erythroleukemia cellsthe hl60 cells lack specific markers for lymphoid cells but express surface receptors for fc fragment and complement c3 which have been associated with differentiated granulocytesthey exhibit phagocytic activity and responsiveness to a chemotactic stimulus commensurate with the proportion of mature cellsas characteristic of transformed cells the hl60 cells form colonies in semisolid medium and produce subcutaneous myeloid tumors chloromas in nude micea source of colonystimulating activity stimulated the cloning efficiency in soft agar 530folddespite adaptations to culture the morphological phenotype and responsiveness to chemical induction of differentiation is essentially unchanged through at least 85 passagescytogenetic studies reveal aneuploidymetaphases with 44 chromosomes predominated in vivo and in early culture passages however clones with 45 or 46 chromosomes became predominant with continued passagingthe most consistent karyotypic abnormalities were the deletion of chromosomes 5 8 and x and the addition of a marker resembling a dgroup acrocentric and of a submetacentric marker most likely an abnormal egroup chromosomeno dna herpesvirus or rna retrovirus was isolated in the fresh or cultured cellsthe hl60 cultured cell line provides a continuous source of human cells for studying the molecular events of myeloid differentiation and the effects of physiologic pharmacologic and virologic elements on this process
