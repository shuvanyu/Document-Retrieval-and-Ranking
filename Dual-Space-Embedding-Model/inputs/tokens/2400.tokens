endothelial antiinflammatory effects of acai ac and red muscadine grape gp polyphenolics have not been extensively investigatedit was hypothesized that polyphenolics from ac and gp exert comparable protective effects in human vascular endothelial cells huvec upon inflammatory stressfurthermore this study investigated whether micrornas relevant to endothelial function might be regulated by ac and gpresults showed that ac and gp 520 mg gallic acid equivalentl protected huvec against glucoseinduced oxidative stress and inflammationglucoseinduced expression of interleukin6 and 8 was downregulated by ac and gp at mrna and protein levelsupon lipopolysaccharide lps 1 μglinduced inflammation ac and gp inhibited gene expression of adhesion molecules and nfκb activation to similar extents although gp was more effective in decreasing pecam1 and icam1 proteinof the screened micrornas only microrna126 expression was found to be modulated by ac and gp as the underlying mechanism to inhibit gene and protein expression of vcam1
