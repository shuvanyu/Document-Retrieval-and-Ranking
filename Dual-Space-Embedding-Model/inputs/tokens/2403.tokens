background polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes widely used as flame retardants since the 1970s have exhibited endocrine disruption in experimental studiestetra to hexabde congeners are estrogenic while heptabde and 6ohbde47 are antiestrogenicmost pbdes also have antiandrogenic activityit is not clear however whether pbdes affect human reproductionobjectives the analysis was designed to investigate the potential endocrine disruption of pbdes on the age at menarche in adolescent girlsmethods we analyzed the data from a sample of 271 adolescent girls age 1219 years in the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes 20032004we estimated the associations between individual and total serum bdes bde28 47 99 100 153 and 154 lipid adjusted and mean age at menarchewe also calculated the risk ratios rrs and 95 confidence intervals ci for menarche prior to age 12 years in relation to pbde exposureresults the median total serum bde concentration was 447 ngg lipidhigher serum pbde concentrations were associated with slightly earlier ages at menarcheeach natural log unit of total bdes was related to a change of 010 95 ci 033 013 years of age at menarche and a rr of 160 95 ci 112 228 for experiencing menarche before 12 years of age after adjustment for potential confoundersconclusion these data suggest high concentrations of serum pbdes during adolescence are associated with a younger age of menarche
