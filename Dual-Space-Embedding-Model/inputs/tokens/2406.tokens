context earlier age at menarche is associated with rapid infancy weight gain and childhood obesitythe role of hormone levels in mediating these associations is unclearobjective the aim of this study was to identify childhood hormone levels at age 8 yr that are associated with early menarche independent of body sizedesign settings and subjects a total of 329 girls from a prospective united kingdom birth cohort study provided blood samples at mean age 81 yr range 8085 for hormone measurements and were followed longitudinally to establish age at menarchemain outcome measures fasting plasma levels of igfi androstenedione dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas leptin insulin igf binding protein1 and shbg were measuredage at menarche was reported by questionnaire and categorized as before 120 120130 or later than 13 yrresults earlier menarche was associated with greater body weight height and body mass index at age 8 yr all ptrend 0001before adjustment for body size earlier menarche was associated with higher levels of igfi androstenedione dheas leptin and fasting insulin and with lower levels of igf binding protein1 and shbg at age 8 yr all p  001after adjustment for body mass index and height at age 8 yr only igfi p  0004 androstenedione p  001 and dheas p  001 remained associated with earlier menarcheconclusions associations between higher levels of igfi and adrenal androgens at age 8 yr with earlier menarche independent of body size support functional roles of these hormones in regulating puberty timing in girlshigher levels of these hormones reported in children who exhibited rapid weight gain during infancy may indicate their role in developmental pathways leading to earlier sexual maturation
