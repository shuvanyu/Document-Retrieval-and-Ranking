pathological colonic tissues were investigated with an environmental scanning electron microscope technique to verify the presence of inorganic nonbiodegradable pollutants iemicro and nanodebris of exogenous origin after debris in liver and kidney had been discoveredin all 18 samples of colon tissues affected by cancer and crohns disease were evaluated and found in all the cases to contain micro and nanoparticlestheir chemistry detected with an xray microprobe indicated a heterogeneous nature whereas the size of the particles was homogeneousthree control samples of healthy young cadavers were analysed and showed the absence of debris within the normal healthy colon mucosathe study reveals the presence of particulate debris generally considered as biocompatible in pathological specimens of human colonthe findings suggest a possible link between the presence of such particles and the underlying pathology in the cases analysed
