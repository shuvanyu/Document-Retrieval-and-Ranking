colon cancer rare in the past and in developing populations currently accounts for 2 to 4 of all deaths in western populationsevidence suggests the primary cause to be changes in diet which affect the bowel milieu int√©rieurit is possible that in sophisticated populations the higher concentrations of fecal bile acids and sterols and longer transit time favor the production of potentially carcinogenic metabolitesof secular changes in diet evidence suggests that the following may have etiological importance 1 the fall in intake of fibercontaining foods with its effects on bowel physiology and 2 the decreased fiber but increased fat intakes in their respective capacities to raise concentrations of fecal bile acids sterols and other noxious substancesfor possible prophylaxis against colon cancer recommendations for a lower fat intake or a higher intake of fibercontaining foods apart from fiber ingestion from bran are extremely unlikely to be adoptedfor future research western populations with considerably lower than average mortality rates eg seventh day adventists mormons the rural finnish population as well as developing populations demand intensive studyalso requiring elucidation are the respective roles of diet and of genetic constitution on concentrations of fecal bile acids etc and on transit time in prone and nonprone populations
