dietary microparticles are nonbiological bacterialsized particlesendogenous sources are derived from intestinal ca and phosphate secretionexogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide tio2 and mixed silicates psil they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human peyers patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in crohns disease cdhowever whether their intake differs between those with and without cd has not been studiedwe aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without cdpatients with inactive cd and matched general practicebased controls ninetyone per group completed 7 d food diariesintake data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controlsall foods pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content and intakes of ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groupsdietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for dietary fibre 12 sd 5 v 14 sd 5 gd p0001 and sucrose 52 sd 27 v 45 sd 18 gd p004 but not for caestimated median tio2 and psil intakes 25 and 35 mgindividual per d respectively totalling 10121013 microparticlesindividual per d were broadly similar to per capita estimates and while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no significant difference between subjects with cd and controlshence if exposure to microparticles is associated with the inflammation of cd then the present study rules out excess intake as the problemnonetheless microparticlecontaining foods have now been identified which allows a lowmicroparticle diet to be further assessed in cd
