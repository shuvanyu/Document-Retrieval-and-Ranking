background ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigenmediated immune responses and cause inflammation in susceptible individualsfollowing recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal lymphoid aggregates this study is the first investigation of whether their reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of crohns diseasemethods in a double blind study 20 patients with active corticosteroidtreated ileal or ileocolonic crohns disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet trial group n  10 or a control diet n  10 for 4 monthscrohns disease activity index cdai and corticosteroid requirements were comparedresults one patient in each group was withdrawnin the trial group there was a progressive decrease in cdai from entry 392  25 to month 4 145  47 p  0002 vs control group and seven patients were in remission cdai 150in contrast the control group had returned to baseline levels 302  28 on entry and 295  25 at month 4 with none in remissioncorticosteroid intake was reduced more in the trial group although this did not reach significanceconclusions a low microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal crohns disease and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets which similarly are low in microparticles
