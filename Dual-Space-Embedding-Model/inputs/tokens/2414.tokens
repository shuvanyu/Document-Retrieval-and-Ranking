objective and design western diets regularly expose the gastrointestinal tract gi to large quantities   1012day of manmade submicronsized particles derived from food additives and excipientsthese are taken up by m cells accumulate in gut macrophages and may influence the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases ibdmaterials we investigated the effects of common dietary microparticles on the function of macrophages from healthy donors or active crohns disease cd patientsmethods macrophages were incubated for 24 h with microparticles before being assayed for cytokine production and phagocytic activityresults microparticles alone were nonstimulatory but in the presence of bacterial antigens such as lps they could act as adjuvants to induce potent cytokine responsesuptake of high concentrations of microparticles also impaired macrophage phagocytic capacity  but not their ability  to take up 2microm fluorescent beadsconclusions while dietary microparticles alone have limited effects on basic macrophage functions their ability to act as adjuvants could aggravate ongoing inflammatory responses towards bacterial antigens in the gi tract
