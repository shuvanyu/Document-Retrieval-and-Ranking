objective to test the claim that pet ownership reduces cardiovascular riskdesign community surveyparticipants 2528 adults aged 4044 years and 2551 aged 6064 years who lived in the australian capital territory and queanbeyan new south wales and were drawn randomly from the australian electoral roll in 2000 and 2001main outcome measures sociodemographic measures including pet ownership and measures of physical health including body mass index bmi alcohol and cigarette consumption and levels of physical activitytwo readings of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were also takenresults while pet owners and nonpet owners had similar levels of systolic blood pressure those with pets had significantly higher diastolic blood pressurepet owners also had higher bmi and were more likely to smokewhile those with pets undertook more mild physical activity they continued to have significantly higher diastolic blood pressure after controlling for hypertensive risk factorsconclusions in this study we found no evidence that pet ownership per se is associated with cardiovascular health benefitsrather pet owners had higher diastolic blood pressure than those without petsit is likely that this increased health risk is linked to other hypertensive risk factors that are only indirectly associated with pet ownership
