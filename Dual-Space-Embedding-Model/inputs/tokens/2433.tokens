backgroundobjectives mushrooms contain very little or any vitamin d2 but are abundant in ergosterol which can be converted into vitamin d2 by ultraviolet uv irradiationour objective was to investigate the bioavailability of vitamin d2 from vitamin d2enhanced mushrooms by uvb in humans and comparing it with a vitamin d2 supplementsubjectsmethods fresh mushrooms were irradiated with an uvb dose of 15 jcm2 increasing vitamin d2 content from 1 to 491 μg100 g and made to an experimental soupin this 5week singleblinded randomized placebocontrolled trial 26 young subjects with serum 25hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd  50 nmoll were randomly assigned into three groups a mushroom b supplement and c placebothey received during winter a 28000 iu 700 μg vitamin d2 via the experimental soup or b 28000 iu vitamin d2 via a supplement or c placebo respectivelyresults after 2 weeks serum 25ohd was significantly higher in the mushroom than in the placebo group p0001the serum 25ohd concentrations in the mushroom and supplement groups rose significantly and similarly over the study period by 39 nmoll 95 confidence interval 95 ci 29 48 and by 47 nmoll per week 95 ci 38 57 respectivelyconclusions we are the first to demonstrate in humans that the bioavailability of vitamin d2 from vitamin d2enhanced button mushrooms via uvb irradiation was effective in improving vitamin d status and not different to a vitamin d2 supplementthis trial was registered at httpgermanctrde as drks00000195
