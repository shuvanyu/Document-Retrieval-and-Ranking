context two reports suggested that vitamin d2 is less effective than vitamin d3 in maintaining vitamin d statusobjective our objective was to determine whether vitamin d2 was less effective than vitamin d3 in maintaining serum 25hydroxyvitamin d levels or increased the catabolism of 25hydroxyvitamin d3subjects and design this was a randomized placebocontrolled doubleblinded study of healthy adults ages 1884 yr who received placebo 1000 iu vitamin d3 1000 iu vitamin d2 or 500 iu vitamin d2 plus 500 iu vitamin d3 daily for 11 wk at the end of the winterresults sixty percent of the healthy adults were vitamin d deficient at the start of the studythe circulating levels of 25hydroxyvitamin d mean  sd increased to the same extent in the groups that received 1000 iu daily as vitamin d2 baseline 169  105 ngml 11 wk 268  96 ngml vitamin d3 baseline 196  111 ngml 11 wk 289  110 ngml or a combination of 500 iu vitamin d2 and 500 iu vitamin d3 baseline 202  104 ngml 11 wk 284  77 ngmlthe 25hydroxyvitamin d3 levels did not change in the group that received 1000 iu vitamin d2 dailythe 1000 iu dose of vitamin d2 or vitamin d3 did not raise 25hydroxyvitamin d levels in vitamin ddeficient subjects above 30 ngmlconclusion a 1000 iu dose of vitamin d2 daily was as effective as 1000 iu vitamin d3 in maintaining serum 25hydroxyvitamin d levels and did not negatively influence serum 25hydroxyvitamin d3 levelstherefore vitamin d2 is equally as effective as vitamin d3 in maintaining 25hydroxyvitamin d status
