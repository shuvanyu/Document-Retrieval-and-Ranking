background the available evidence on vitamin d and mortality is inconclusiveobjectives to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin d for prevention of mortality in adultssearch strategy we searched the cochrane library medline embase lilacs the science citation index expanded and conference proceedings citation indexscience to january 2011we scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trialsselection criteria we included randomised trials that compared vitamin d at any dose duration and route of administration versus placebo or no interventionvitamin d could have been administered as supplemental vitamin d vitamin d3 cholecalciferol or vitamin d2 ergocalciferol or an active form of vitamin d 1Î±hydroxyvitamin d alfacalcidol or 125dihydroxyvitamin d calcitrioldata collection and analysis six authors extracted data independentlyrandomeffects and fixedeffect model metaanalyses were conductedfor dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratios rrto account for trials with zero events metaanalyses of dichotomous data were repeated using risk differences rd and empirical continuity correctionsrisk of bias was considered in order to minimise risk of systematic errorstrial sequential analyses were conducted to minimise the risk of random errorsmain results fifty randomised trials with 94148 participants provided data for the mortality analysesmost trials included elderly women older than 70 yearsvitamin d was administered for a median of two yearsmore than one half of the trials had a low risk of biasoverall vitamin d decreased mortality rr 097 95 confidence interval ci 094 to 100 i2  0when the different forms of vitamin d were assessed separately only vitamin d3 decreased mortality significantly rr 094 95 ci 091 to 098 i2  0 74789 participants 32 trials whereas vitamin d2 alfacalcidol or calcitriol did nottrial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin d3 corresponding to 161 individuals treated to prevent one additional deathvitamin d3 combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis rr 117 95 ci 102 to 134 i2  0alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia rr 318 95 ci 117 to 868 i2  17data on healthrelated quality of life and health economics were inconclusiveauthors conclusions vitamin d in the form of vitamin d3 seems to decrease mortality in predominantly elderly women who are mainly in institutions and dependent carevitamin d2 alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant effect on mortalityvitamin d3 combined with calcium significantly increased nephrolithiasisboth alfacalcidol and calcitriol significantly increased hypercalcaemia
