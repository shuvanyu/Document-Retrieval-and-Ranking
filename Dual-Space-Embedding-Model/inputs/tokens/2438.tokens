few foods contain ergocalciferol or cholecalciferoltreatment of mushrooms with uv light increases ergocalciferol content and could provide a dietary source of vitamin d we evaluated the impact of consuming uvtreated white button mushrooms agaricus bisporus on the vitamin d status of healthy adultsthirtyeight volunteers were randomized to 4 treatments consumed with a standard meal for 6 wk the control c group received untreated mushrooms providing 085 μgd ergocalciferol n  10 groups m1 and m2 received uvtreated mushrooms providing 88 n  10 and 171 μgd n  9 respectively and the supplement s group received purified ergocalciferol plus untreated mushrooms providing a total of 282 μgd n  9serum total 25hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd and 25hydroxyergocalciferol 25ohd2 were 83  38 and 24  20 nmoll respectively at baseline mean  sdat wk 6 25ohd2 had increased and was higher in all treatment groups than in the c group whereas 25hydroxycholecalciferol 25ohd3 had decreased and was lower in the m2 and s groups than in the c groupincreases in 25ohd2 for groups c m1 m2 and s were 12  52 138  73 127  37 and 328  33 nmoll and decreases in 25ohd3 were 39  163 104  64 206  146 and 295  159 nmoll respectivelyconcentrations did not change in group c in summary ergocalciferol was absorbed and metabolized to 25ohd2 but did not affect vitamin d status because 25ohd3 decreased proportionally
