because the range of bowel habits and stool types in the community is unknown we questioned 838 men and 1059 women comprising 722 of a random stratified sample of the east bristol populationmost of them kept records of three consecutive defecations including stool form on a validated six point scale ranging from hard round lumps to mushyquestionnaire responses agreed moderately well with recorded dataalthough the most common bowel habit was once daily this was a minority practice in both sexes a regular 24 hour cycle was apparent in only 40 of men and 33 of womenanother 7 of men and 4 of women seemed to have a regular twice or thrice daily bowel habitthus most people had irregular bowelsa third of women defecated less often than daily and 1 once a week or lessstools at the constipated end of the scale were passed more often by women than menin women of child bearing age bowel habit and the spectrum of stool types were shifted towards constipation and irregularity compared with older women and three cases of severe slow transit constipation were discovered in young womenotherwise age had little effect on bowel habit or stool typenormal stool types defined as those least likely to evoke symptoms accounted for only 56 of all stools in women and 61 in menmost defecations occurred in the early morning and earlier in men than in womenwe conclude that conventionally normal bowel function is enjoyed by less than half the population and that in this aspect of human physiology younger women are especially disadvantaged
