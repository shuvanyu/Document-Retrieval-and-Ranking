the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a single highfat meal with different fat quality on circulating inflammatory markers and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc to elucidate the role of fat quality on postprandial inflammationa postprandial study with fourteen healthy females consuming three test meals with different fat quality was performedtest days were separated by 2 weeksfasting and postprandial blood samples at 3 and 6 h after intake were analysedthe test meal consisted of three cakes enriched with coconut fat 43  energy as saturated fat and 1  energy as αlinolenic acid ala linseed oil 14  energy as ala and 30  energy as saturated fat and cod liver oil 5  energy as epa and dha and 5  energy as ala in addition to 31  energy as saturated fatin addition ex vivo pbmc experiments were performed in eight healthy subjects investigating the effects of epa and ala on release and gene expression of inflammatory markersthe il8 mrna level was significantly increased after intake of the cod liver oil cake at 6 h compared with fasting level which was significantly different from the effect observed after the intake of linseed cakein contrast no effect was seen on circulating level of il8in addition ala and epa were shown to elicit different effects on the release and mrna expression levels of inflammatory markers in pbmc cultured ex vivo with epa having the most prominent proinflammatory potential
