the aim of the present in situ study was to evaluate the effect of different periods of intraoral remineralisation on the susceptibility of softened dentin to toothbrushing abrasiongroups of 6 human dentin specimens af were recessed in the buccal aspects of intraoral appliances which were worn for 21 days by 11 volunteersthe samples were demineralised twice a day extraorally in the acidic beverage sprite light ph 29 for 90 s subsequently the dentin specimens were brushed at different timesspecimen a was brushed immediately after demineralisationspecimens be were brushed after the intraoral appliances had been worn for various periods in the mouth specimen b for 10 min c for 20 min d for 30 min and e for 60 minspecimen f was not brushed controlafter 21 days dentin wear was measured with a profilometerthe following values means  standard deviation were recorded microm a 236  167 b 379  297 c 318  265 d 185  105 e 153  116 f 126  67there was a statistically significantly increased dentin loss for groups a b and c as compared to the controls u test p  005however after intraoral periods of 30 and 60 min wear was not significantly higher than in unbrushed controlsit is concluded that for protection of dentin surfaces at least 30 min should elapse before toothbrushing after an erosive attackcopyright 2004 s karger ag basel
