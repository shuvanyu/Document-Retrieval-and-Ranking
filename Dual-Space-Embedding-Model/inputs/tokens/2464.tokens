we previously reported an association between prenatal exposure to airborne pah and lower birth weight birth length and head circumferencethe main goal of the present analysis was to assess the possible impact of coexposure to pahcontaining of barbecued meat consumed during pregnancy on birth outcomesthe birth cohort consisted of 432 pregnant women who gave birth at term 36 weeks of gestationonly nonsmoking women with singleton pregnancies 1835 years of age and who were free from chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension were included in the studydetailed information on diet over pregnancy was collected through interviews and the measurement of exposure to airborne pahs was carried out by personal air monitoring during the second trimester of pregnancythe effect of barbecued meat consumption on birth outcomes birthweight length and head circumference at birth was adjusted in multiple linear regression models for potential confounding factors such as prenatal exposure to airborne pahs childs sex gestational age parity size of mother maternal prepregnancy weight weight gain in pregnancy and prenatal environmental tobacco smoke etsthe multivariable regression model showed a significant deficit in birthweight associated with barbecued meat consumption in pregnancy coeff  1060 g 95ci 2933 358 the effect of exposure to airborne pahs was about the same magnitude order coeff 1646 g 95ci 1723  347combined effect of both sources of exposure amounted to birth weight deficit of 2143 g 95ci 4190  96regression models performed for birth length and head circumference showed similar trends but the estimated effects were of borderline significance levelas the intake of barbecued meat did not affect the duration of pregnancy the reduced birthweight could not have been mediated by shortened gestation periodin conclusion the study results provided epidemiologic evidence that prenatal pah exposure from diet including grilled meat might be hazardous for fetal development
