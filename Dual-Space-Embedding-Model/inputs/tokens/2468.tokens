green tea is a commonly consumed beverage in asia and has been suggested to have antiinflammatory and possible anticarcinogenic properties in laboratory studieswe sought to examine the association between green tea consumption and risk of breast cancer incidence or recurrence using all available epidemiologic evidence to datewe conducted a systematic search of five databases and performed a metaanalysis of studies of breast cancer risk and recurrence published between 1998 and 2009 encompassing 5617 cases of breast cancersummary relative risks rr were calculated using a fixed effects model and tests of heterogeneity across combined studies were conductedwe identified two studies of breast cancer recurrence and seven studies of breast cancer incidenceincreased green tea consumption more than three cups a day was inversely associated with breast cancer recurrence pooled rr  073 95 ci 056096an analysis of casecontrol studies of breast cancer incidence suggested an inverse association with a pooled rr of 081 95 ci 075 088 while no association was found among cohort studies of breast cancer incidencecombining all studies of breast cancer incidence resulted in significant heterogeneityavailable epidemiologic evidence supports the hypothesis that increased green tea consumption may be inversely associated with risk of breast cancer recurrencethe association between green tea consumption and breast cancer incidence remains unclear based on the current evidence
