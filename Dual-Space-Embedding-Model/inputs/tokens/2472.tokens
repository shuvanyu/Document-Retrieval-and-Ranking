background heterocyclic amines mutagens formed in meats cooked at high temperatures have been demonstrated as mammary carcinogens in animalswe conducted a nested casecontrol study among 41836 cohort members of the iowa womens health study to evaluate the potential role of heterocyclic amines and intake of welldone meat in the risk for human breast cancermethods a questionnaire was mailed to individuals in the cohort who had breast cancer diagnosed during the period from 1992 through 1994 and a random sample of cancerfree cohort members to obtain information on usual intake of meats and on meat preparation practicescolor photographs showing various doneness levels of hamburger beefsteak and bacon were includedmultivariate analysis was performed on data from 273 case subjects and 657 control subjects who completed the surveyresults a doseresponse relationship was found between doneness levels of meat consumed and breast cancer riskthe adjusted odds ratios ors for very welldone meat versus rare or mediumdone meat were 154 95 confidence interval ci096247 for hamburger 221 95 ci130377 for beef steak and 164 95 ci092293 for baconwomen who consumed these three meats consistently very well done had a 462 times higher risk 95 ci1361570 than that of women who consumed the meats rare or medium donerisk of breast cancer was also elevated with increasing intake of welldone to very welldone meatconclusions consumption of welldone meats and thus exposures to heterocyclic amines or other compounds formed during hightemperature cooking may play an important role in the risk of breast cancer
