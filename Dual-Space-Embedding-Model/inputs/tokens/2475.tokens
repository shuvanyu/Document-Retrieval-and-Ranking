heteroyclic aromatic amines haas are a class of hazardous chemicals that are receiving heightened attention as a risk factor for human cancerhaas arise during the cooking of meats fish and poultry and several haas also occur in tobacco smoke condensate and diesel exhaustmany haas are carcinogenic and induce tumors at multiple sites in rodentsa number of epidemiologic studies have reported that frequent consumption of welldone cooked meats containing haas can result in elevated risks for colon prostate and mammary cancersmoreover dna adducts of haas have been detected in human tissues demonstrating that haas induce genetic damage even though the concentrations of these compounds in cooked meats are generally in the low partsperbillion ppb rangewith recent improvements in sensitivity of mass spectrometry instrumentation haas their metabolites and dna adducts can be detected at trace amounts in biological fluids and tissues of humansthe incorporation of haa biomarkers in epidemologic studies will help to clarify the role of these dietary genotoxicants in the etiology of human cancer
