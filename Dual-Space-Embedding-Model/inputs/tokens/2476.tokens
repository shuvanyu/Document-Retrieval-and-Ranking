the cooked meat derived genotoxic carcinogen 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip induces cancer of the colon prostate and mammary gland when fed to ratsepidemiology studies link these tumours to a western diet and exposure to heterocyclic amines such as phipwe have shown that phip is also potently estrogenic and have proposed that this hormonal activity contributes to its target site carcinogenicitywe now postulate that the estrogenic properties of phip influence metastatic potentialwe have used an in vitro assay for cell invasion based upon digestion and migration through a reconstituted basement membrane modelzymography and immunoblotting were used to confirm phipmediated changes associated with induction of the invasive phenotypetreatment of the mammary cancer cell lines mcf7 and t47d with phip induces cells to digest and migrate through a reconstituted basement membranethe response was dose dependent observed at subnanomolar concentrations of phip and was inhibited by the antiestrogen ici 182780the phipinduced invasive phenotype was associated with expression of cathepsin d cyclooxygenase2 and matrix metalloproteinase activitythese findings emphasise the range and potency of the biological activities associated with this cooked meat product and mechanistically support the tissuespecific carcinogenicity of the chemicalcopyright  2010 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
