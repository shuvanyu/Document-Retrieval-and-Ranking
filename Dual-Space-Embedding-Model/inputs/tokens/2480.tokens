it was the aim of this study to examine the association of the consumption of meat in general meat prepared by different cooking methods and the dietary intake of heterocyclic aromatic amines hca with the level of dna adducts in the breast tissue of women undergoing reduction mammoplastydietary intake of meat and hca were assessed via questionnaire in 44 women undergoing reduction mammoplastydna adduct analysis in breast tissue was performed by 32ppostlabelling analysisspearman rank correlation coefficients r were calculated to examine the association of meat consumption and dietary hca intake with tissue dna adduct levelsa median dna adduct level of 1845 interquartile range 12812565 per 109 nucleotides in breast tissue was observed median hca intake was 4043 ngday interquartile range 195510233 ngdaytotal hca intake r  033 p  003 consumption of fried meat r  039 p  001 beef r  032 p  003 and processed meat r  051 p  00004 were statistically significantly correlated with the level of dna adducts in breast tissuethe detected dna adducts could not be confirmed to be specific hcaderived dna adducts by comparison with external standards using the 32ppostlabelling assaywe observed strong correlations of dietary hca intake and consumption of fried and processed meat with dna adduct levels in breast tissue of 44 womensince the detected dna adducts were not necessarily specific only for hca it is possible that hca intake is a surrogate of other genotoxic substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meat prepared at high temperatures
