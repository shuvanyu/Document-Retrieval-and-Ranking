the cooked meat carcinogen 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip induces tumours of the breast colon and prostate in ratshere we show that in addition to its wellestablished genotoxicity which can be detected at concentrations 106 m phip is also oestrogenicin cos1 cells transiently transfected with an oestrogenresponsive reporter gene phip 1010106 m mediated transcription through oestrogen receptor er alpha but not erbeta and inhibition by the pure er antagonist ici 182 780 demonstrated a requirement for a functional erin contrast the structurally related foodderived carcinogen 2amino38dimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline meiqx failed to induce reporter gene transcriptionadditionally we show that in a hormonally responsive breast cancer cell line mcf7 cells phip induced transcriptional activation using endogenously expressed erexamination of the genotoxic potential of phip using a model mammalian cell mutation assay hprt locus demonstrated that the genetic toxicology of phip was readily detectable but separate in terms of effective concentration from its oestrogenic activityto determine whether the oestrogenicity of phip could mediate oestrogendependent responses such as cell growth we examined the growth of hormonally responsive cells mcf7 cellswe show that phip can stimulate cell proliferation and again this was dependent upon a functional erusing ligand blotting we further show that phip can stimulate the expression of progesterone receptor pra and prb and cmyc and activate the mapk signal transduction pathwaythese responses were similar to that produced by oestradiol in terms of temporal aspects potency and a requirement for a functional ereach of these dosedependent mitogenic responses occurred at concentrations of phip  approximately 1091011m that are likely to be equivalent to systemic human exposure via consumption of cooked meatthus phip can induce cellular responses that encompass altered gene expression and mitogenesiswe suggest that the combination of genetic toxicology and oestrogenlike promotion of genomic and cellular events provide a mechanism for the tissuespecific tumorigenicity of this compound
