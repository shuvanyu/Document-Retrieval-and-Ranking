liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ms with a triple quadrupole ms was used to identify known and novel heterocyclic aromatic amines haas in human urinethe identities of 2amino38dimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline 8meiqx and 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip were confirmed by their product ion spectrathe constant neutral loss scan mode was employed to probe for other analytes in urine that display the transition mhmhch3 which is common to haas containing an nmethylimidazo moiety and led to the detection of a previously unreported isomer of 8meiqx holland r et al2004 chemrestoxicol17 11211136we now report the identification of another novel haa 2amino1methylimidazo45bquinoline iq45b an isomer of the powerful animal carcinogen 2amino3methylimidazo45fquinoline iqthe amounts of iq45b measured in the urine of human volunteers who consumed grilled beef ranged from 15 to 135 of the ingested dose while the amounts of 8meiqx and phip excreted in urine were on average 2 of the ingested dosebase treatment of urine at 70 degrees c increased the concentrations of 8meiqx and phip by as much as 6fold indicating the presence of phase ii conjugates however the amount of iq45b increased by more than 100foldiq45b was also detected in the urine of vegetarians following base hydrolysisthe formation of iq45b but not iq 8meiqx or phip also occurred in urine incubated at 37 degrees c creatinine and 2aminobenzaldehyde are likely precursors of iq45bthe detection of iq45b in the urine of both meat eaters and vegetarians suggests that this haa may be present in nonmeat staples or that iq45b formation may occur endogenously within the urinary bladder or other biological fluids
