background alterations in the intestinal bacterial flora are believed to be contributing factors to many chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases including rheumatic diseaseswhile microbiological fecal culture analysis is now increasingly used little is known about the relationship of changes in intestinal flora dietary patterns and clinical outcome in specific diseasesto clarify the role of microbiological culture analysis we aimed to evaluate whether in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra or fibromyalgia fm a mediterranean diet or an 8day fasting period are associated with changes in fecal flora and whether changes in fecal flora are associated with clinical outcomemethods during a twomonthsperiod 51 consecutive patients from an integrative medicine hospital department with an established diagnosis of ra n  16 or fm n  35 were included in the studyaccording to predefined clinical criteria and the subjects choice the patients received a mostly vegetarian mediterranean diet n  21 mean age 509 133 y or participated in an intermittent modified 8day fasting therapy n  30 mean age 537  94 yquantitative aerob and anaerob bacterial flora stool ph and concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin a siga were analysed from stool samples at the beginning at the end of the 2week hospital stay and at a 3months followupclinical outcome was assessed with the das 28 for ra patients and with a disease severity rating scale in fm patientsresults we found no significant changes in the fecal bacterial counts following the two dietary interventions within and between groups nor were significant differences found in the analysis of siga and stool phclinical improvement at the end of the hospital stay tended to be greater in fasting vs nonfasting patients with ra p  009clinical outcome was not related to alterations in the intestinal floraconclusion neither mediterranean diet nor fasting treatments affect the microbiologically assessed intestinal flora and siga levels in patients with ra and fmthe impact of dietary interventions on the human intestinal flora and the role of the fecal flora in rheumatic diseases have to be clarified with newer molecular analysis techniquesthe potential benefit of fasting treatment in ra and fm should be further tested in randomised trials
