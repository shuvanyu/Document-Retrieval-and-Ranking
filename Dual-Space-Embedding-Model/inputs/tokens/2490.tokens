studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of apples and the risk of several cancersthe peels of apple which have been shown to possess exceptionally high concentrations of antioxidants are often discardedin this study we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of apple peel extract ape in variety of cancer cell typesour data demonstrated that ape obtained from organic gala apples imparted significant reduction in the viability of a variety of cancer cell linesfurther our data showed a significant decrease in growth and clonogenic survival of human prostate carcinoma cwr22rnu1 and du145 cells and breast carcinoma mcf7 and mcf7her18 cellsalso the antiproliferative effects of ape were found to be accompanied by a g0g1 phase arrest of prostate and breast cancer cellsfurthermore ape treatment resulted in a marked concentrationdependent decrease in the protein levels of proliferative cell nuclear antigen a marker for proliferationin addition ape treatment resulted in a marked increase in maspin a tumor suppressor protein that negatively regulates cell invasion metastasis and angiogenesisour data suggested that ape possesses strong antiproliferative effects against cancer cells and apple peels should not be discarded from the dietdetailed mechanistic studies especially in appropriate in vivo animal models are needed to further examine the antiproliferative and preventive effects of ape against cancer
