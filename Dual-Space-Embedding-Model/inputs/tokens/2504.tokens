patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra have been described as having significantly low serum potassium concentrations than that in healthy subjectswe assessed the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral potassium supplement dissolved in grape juice in female hypokalemic patients with active rathirtytwo hypokalemic patients with active ra were investigated in a parallel randomized designin addition to their usual medication the control group received placebo and the intervention group received 6000 mg chloride potassium dissolved in grape juice on 28 consecutive daysthe primary outcome parameter was the change of pain on a visual analog scale vasthe american college of rheumatology acr percent response criteria and disease activity score 28 das28 28joint count and the european league against rheumatism eular moderate response were assessedmean age was 486  6 yearsin the potassium group 4375 716 of the patients met the criteria of 33 lower pain intensity compared with 625 116 in the placebo group p  02 at day 28also 3125 516 of the patients in the intervention group achieved moderate responses according to the eular criteriathe corresponding percentage for patients receiving placebo was 625 116 p  05potassium supplements appeared to decrease pain intensityperspective this article reports a trial evaluating the effect of potassium supplementation in the treatment of pain in hypokalemic patients with rheumatoid arthritisthe elevated serum cortisol and potassium values in the treatment group correlate negatively with patients assessment of pain intensity reflecting an antipain effect for potassium supplementation
