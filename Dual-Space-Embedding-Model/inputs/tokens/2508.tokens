costimulatory signals through the cd28 receptor enhance the survival of t cells that have their antigen receptor tcr engagedhere we show that stimulation through the cd28 receptor in the absence of tcr engagement with either an anticd28 crosslinking antibody or the cd80 ligand transiently increases expression of the insulinlike growth factori receptor igfir on t cellsantibodies that block signaling through the igfir decrease the survival of t cells activated through the tcr and cd28 in the presence of il2 by more than 50 and also enhance susceptibility to fasinduced apoptosiscd28 stimulation increases igfir expression on jurkat cells and exogenously added igfi can protect these cells from fasinduced apoptosiswe conclude that cd28mediated enhancement of igfir expression provides activated t cells with essential survival signals that are independent of survival mediated by il2 and bclxl
