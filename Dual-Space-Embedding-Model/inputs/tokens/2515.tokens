background it is well documented that renal transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing skin cancers in particular squamous cell carcinomasless extensively reviewed in the literature is the increased incidence of malignant melanomawe have reviewed 10 patients in the oxford renal transplant population who developed 12 melanomas following transplantationobjectives to determine the incidence and characteristics of melanoma in renal transplant recipientsmethods we reviewed the case notes and pathology of all patients who developed melanoma within the oxford renal transplant unitthe clinical details were recorded including date of transplant immunosuppressive therapy interval between transplant and melanoma site of occurrence history of sun exposure type of clinician diagnosing the melanoma history of other skin malignancies and outcomefrom the histopathology we documented various prognostic factorsresults ten patients developed 12 melanomas one patient had three melanomas from a population of 1874 transplanted patientsthe total number of transplant years was 11 9422the incidence of melanoma in our population was 12 per 11 9422 transplant years which is approximately 8 times greater than the standardized rate for this regionwe found that the mean interval between transplant and melanoma was approximately 11 years median 85a dermatologist was the diagnosing clinician in at least 67 of casesmelanomas occurred on the trunk in the majority of cases 58 followed by the upper limb 25all patients apart from one are alive with no recurrence of their melanomaone patient died as a result of metastatic melanomathe mean followup period following melanoma was 37 yearsin all patients apart from the patient who died the melanomas were  1 mm breslow thicknessthat patients melanoma was 45 mm thickthere was no precursor naevus in eight of the 12 melanomasin two there was a precursor dysplastic naevusin the cases in vertical growth phase the tumourinfiltrating lymphocyte response was absent in four cases and nonbrisk in one patientconclusions in the oxford transplant population studied melanomas occurred at approximately 8 times the rate in the general populationthis is the highest rate reported in the literaturethe patients had a better outcome than reported previouslythis may be due to detection at a relatively early stagerenal transplant recipients attend dedicated dermatology clinics in oxford which may have contributed to the early diagnosis and good outcome
