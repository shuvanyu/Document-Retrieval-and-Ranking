erythritol a naturally occurring polyol is gaining attention as a bulk sweetener for human nutritionindustrially it is produced from glucose by fermentationfrom various studies it is known to be noncariogenicmoreover it is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and quantitatively excreted in the urineonly about 10  enters the colonearlier in vitro experiments showed that erythritol remained unfermented for a fermentation period of 12 h in order to investigate whether fresh human intestinal microbiota is able to adapt its enzyme activities to erythritol a 24 h lasting fermentation was carried out under wellstandardised in vitro conditionsfor comparison maltitol lactulose and blank faecal inoculum only were incubated as wellfermentation patterns were established by following total gas production hydrogen accumulation changes in ph value scfa production and substrate degradationtaking all fermentation parameters into account erythritol turned out to be completely resistant to bacterial attack within 24 h thus excluding an adaptation within that periodsince under in vivo conditions more easily fermentable substrates enter the colon continuously it seems very unlikely that erythritol will be fermented in vivo
