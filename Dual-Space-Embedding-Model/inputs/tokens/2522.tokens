various methods have been described in the literature for the detection of virulent yersinia enterocolitica in pigsthe risk factors for pig herd contamination have yet to be determinedthe objective of this study was to validate a sensitive method for the detection of y enterocolitica and to describe the distribution of the bacteria in pigs at slaughter from conventional and alternative organic housing systemsfirst samples were collected from tonsils caecum with caecal contents and the caecal lymph nodes of 60 slaughter pigsthese samples were used to compare the sensitivity of six different laboratory culture methods either in common use or described in the literature with that of a polymerase chain reaction with two primer pairs multiplex pcrthen only pcr was used to examine tonsils caecum and caecal lymph nodes from two groups of slaughter pigs 210 from six conventional fattening farms and 200 from three with alternative housingthe results of the multiplex pcr were positive in 28 casesall culture methods proved inferior to pcr in sensitivityin the second part of the study pcr detected 36 18 positive pigs from alternative housing and 60 29 from conventional housing p005the highest rate of y enterocolitica contamination was found in tonsils 11 alternative 22 conventional p005 followed by caecum 5 11 and lymph nodes 2 7the housing system appears to be one important factor in the prevalence of this common pathogen in pig herds as we found important differences between the two systems studied herein the conventional system the main risk factors appeared to be sourcing pigs from different pig suppliers use of commercial feed and transportation to slaughter
