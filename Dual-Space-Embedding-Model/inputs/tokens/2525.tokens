in this article we estimate the annual cost of illness and qualityadjusted life year qaly loss in the united states caused by 14 of the 31 major foodborne pathogens reported on by scallan et alemerginfectdis17715 2011 based on their incidence estimates of foodborne illness in the united statesthese 14 pathogens account for 95  of illnesses and hospitalizations and 98  of deaths due to identifiable pathogens estimated by scallan et alwe estimate that these 14 pathogens cause 140 billion ranging from 44 billion to 330 billion in cost of illness and a loss of 61000 qalys ranging from 19000 to 145000 qalys per yearroughly 90  of this loss is caused by five pathogens nontyphoidal salmonella enterica 33 billion 17000 qalys campylobacter spp17 billion 13300 qalys listeria monocytogenes 26 billion 9400 qalys toxoplasma gondii 3 billion 11000 qalys and norovirus 2 billion 5000 qalysa companion article attributes losses estimated in this study to the consumption of specific categories of foodsto arrive at these estimates for each pathogen we create disease outcome trees that characterize the symptoms severities durations outcomes and likelihoods of health states associated with that pathogenwe then estimate the cost of illness medical costs productivity loss and valuation of premature mortality for each pathogenwe also estimate qaly loss for each health state associated with a given pathogen using the euroqol 5d scaleconstruction of disease outcome trees outcomespecific cost of illness and euroqol 5d scoring are described in greater detail in a second companion article
