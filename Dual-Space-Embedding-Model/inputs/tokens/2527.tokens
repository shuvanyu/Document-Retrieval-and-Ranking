background yersinia enterocolitica ye infection has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of graves disease gdthe association between ye and gd could however also be due to common genetic or environmental factors affecting the development of both ye infection and gdthis potential confounding can be minimized by investigation of twin pairs discordant for gdaim to examine whether ye infection is associated with gddesign we first conducted a classical casecontrol study of individuals with 61 and without 122 gd and then a casecontrol study of twin pairs 36 discordant for gdmethods immunoglobulin iga and igg antibodies to virulenceassociated yersinia outer membrane proteins yops were measuredmain outcome measures the prevalence of yop iga and igg antibodiesresults subjects with gd had a higher prevalence of yop iga 49vs34 p  0054 and ypo igg 51vs35 p  0043 than the external controlsthe frequency of chronic ye infection reflected by the presence of both iga and igg yop antibodies was also higher among cases than controls 49vs33 p  0042similar results were found in twin pairs discordant for gdin the casecontrol analysis individuals with gd had an increased odds ratio or of ye infection iga 184 95 ci 099345 and igg 190 95 ci 102355in the cotwin analysis the twin with gd also had an increased or of ye infection iga 55 95 ci 1212481 and igg 50 95 ci 1102281conclusion the finding of an association between gd and ye in the casecontrol study and within twin pairs discordant for gd supports the notion that ye infection plays an aetiological role in the occurrence of gd or vice versafuture studies should examine the temporal relationship of this association in more depth
