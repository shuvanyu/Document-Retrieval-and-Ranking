yersinia enterocolitica is considered an important foodborne pathogen impacting the pork production and processing industry in the united statessince this bacterium is a commensal of swine the primary goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of pathogenic y enterocolitica in pigs in the united sates using feces as the sample sourcea total of 2793 fecal samples were tested for its presence in swinefecal samples were collected from late finisher pigs from 77 production sites in the 15 eastern and midwestern porkproducing states over a period of 27 weeks 6 september 2000 to 20 march 2001the prevalence of ailpositive y enterocolitica was determined in samples using both a fluorogenic 5 nuclease pcr assay and a culture methodthe mean prevalence was 1310 366 of 2793 fecal samples tested when both pcr and culturepositive results were combinedfortyone of 77 premises 5325 contained at least one fecal sample positive for the ail sequencethe pcr assay indicated a contamination rate of 1235 3452793 compared to 408 1142793 by the culture methodof the 345 pcrpositive samples 252 were culture negative while of the 114 culturepositive samples 21 were pcr negativeamong 77 premises the pcr assay revealed a significantly p  005 higher percentage 4675 n  36 sites of samples positive for the pathogen ail sequence than the culture method 2208 n  17 sitesthus higher sensitivity with respect to number of samples and sites identified as positive for the pcr method compared with the culture method for detecting pathogenic y enterocolitica was demonstrated in this studythe results support the hypothesis that swine are a reservoir for y enterocolitica strains potentially pathogenic for humans
