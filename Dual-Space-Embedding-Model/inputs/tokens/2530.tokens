background in the united states contaminated food causes approximately 1000 reported disease outbreaks and an estimated 48 million illnesses 128000 methods the foodborne diseases active surveillance network foodnet conducts surveillance among 15 of the us population for laboratoryconfirmed infections with nine pathogens transmitted commonly through foodoverall and pathogenspecific changes in incidence were estimated from 19961998 to 2010 and from 20062008 to 2010hospitalizations and 3000 deaths annuallythis report summarizes 2010 surveillance data and describes trends since 1996results a total of 19089 infections 4247 hospitalizations and 68 deaths were reported from foodnet sites in 2010salmonella infection was the most common infection reported 176 illnesses per 100000 persons and was associated with the largest number of hospitalizations 2290 and deaths 29 no significant change in incidence of salmonella infection has occurred since the start of surveillance during 19961998shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli stec o157 infection caused 09 illnesses per 100000compared with 19961998 overall incidence of infection with six key pathogens in 2010 was 23 lower and pathogenspecific incidence was lower for campylobacter listeria stec o157 shigella and yersinia infection but higher for vibrio infectioncompared with a more recent period 20062008 incidence in 2010 was lower for stec o157 and shigella infection but higher for vibrio infectionconclusions the incidence of stec o157 infection has declined to reach the 2010 national health objective target of 1 case per 100000this success as well as marked declines since 19961998 in overall incidence of six key foodborne infections demonstrates the feasibility of preventing foodborne illnessesimplications for public health practice salmonella infection should be targeted because it has not declined significantly in more than a decade and other data indicate that it is one of the most common foodborne infections resulting in an estimated 365 million in direct medical costs annuallythe prevention measures that reduced stec o157 infection need to be applied more broadly to reduce salmonella and other infectionseffective measures from farm to table include preventing contamination of meat during slaughter and of all foods including produce during processing and preparation cooking meat thoroughly vigorously detecting and investigating outbreaks and recalling contaminated food
