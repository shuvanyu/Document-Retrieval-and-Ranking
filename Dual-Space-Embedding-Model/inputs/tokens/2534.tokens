a survey of 788 pigs from 120 farms was conducted to determine the withinfarm prevalence of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and a questionnaire of management conditions was mailed to the farms afterwardsa univariate statistical analysis with carriage and shedding as outcomes was conducted with randomeffects logistic regression with farm as a clustering factorvariables with a p value 015 were included into the respective multivariate randomeffects logistic regression modelthe use of municipal water was discovered to be a protective factor against carriage and faecal shedding of the pathogenorganic production and buying feed from a certain feed manufacturer were also protective against total carriagetonsillar carriage a different feed manufacturer fasting pigs before transport to the slaughterhouse higherlevel farm health classification and snout contacts between pigs were risk factors for faecal sheddingwe concluded that differences in management can explain different prevalences of y enterocolitica between farms
