in this study we hoped to provide valuable clinical information on yersiniosis for clinicianstwo thousand six hundred stool samples were collected from in and outpatients with diarrhea which were tested with both culture method and realtime polymerase chain reaction rtpcrin total 188 positive samples were detected by rtpcr 178 and culture method 160 while the incidence was about 723the detection rate of rtpcr was significantly higher than culture method and a higher incidence in autumnwinter was also noticeably identified than in springsummerinfection sources mostly focused on unboiled foods 101 and pets 45 while clinical manifestation mainly presented as gastroenteritis 156 pseudoappendicitis 32 and extraintestinal complications 46the morbidity of extraintestinal complications in adults was significantly higher than in children and it was the same for highrisk patients between adults over the age of 60 years 47 and children under the age of 3 years 14 whereas the constituent ratio of children versus adults with yersiniosis in different systems was not significantof 160 isolates tested for antimicrobial susceptibility the majority were susceptible to thirdgeneration cephalosporins aminoglycosides fluoroquinolones and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole whereas only a small portion was susceptible to the firstgeneration cephalosporins and penicillinsduring autumnwinter months clinicians should pay more attention to clinical manifestation early diagnosis and treatment with susceptible antibiotics of yersiniosis and its complications targeting highrisk patients
