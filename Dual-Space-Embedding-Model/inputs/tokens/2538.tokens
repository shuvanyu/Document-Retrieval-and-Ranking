ractopamine hydrochloride rac has consistently led to an advantage in carcass cutting yields of finishing pigs and remains a common feed additive in us finishing pig dietsless is known about the effect of rac on further processing characteristicssome researchers have reported advantages in ultimate ph of the lm in pigs fed racif a greater ultimate ph was also observed in hams the increased ph could affect further processing characteristics and lead to better protein interaction and improved textural propertiesthe objective of this experiment was to determine if racfed pigs yielded hams with a greater ultimate ph and if so whether or not that advantage improves textural properties and water retention of further processed hamstwo hundred hams from barrows and gilts fed rac or control diets were selected based on hcwhams were fabricated into 5 separate pieces to determine cutting yields and 6 muscles were evaluated for ultimate phhams were processed to make cured and smoked hamsractopamine increased cutting yields of the whole ham p  00001 inside p  001 outside p  001 and knuckle p  001 when expressed as a percentage of chilled side weightultimate ph of the rectus femoris vastus lateralis and semitendinosus were all 006 ph units greater p  005 the biceps femoris was 004 ph units greater p  002 and the semimembranosus and adductor muscles were 003 ph units greater in pigs fed 74 mgkg of rac when compared with control pigscured hams from racfed pigs were heavier at all stages of productionno differences were detected in binding strengths p  088 or protein fatfree values p  013 between rac 906 kg and 2037 and control hams 901 kg and 2013ractopamine increased cutting yields total weight of cured hams and ultimate muscle phractopamine can be fed to pigs to achieve the desired growth characteristic advantages and cutting yields without affecting further processed ham characteristics
