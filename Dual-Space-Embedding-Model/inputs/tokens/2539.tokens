a number of technologies that increase feed efficiency and lean tissue deposition while decreasing fat deposition have been developed in an effort to improve profitability of animal productionin general the mode of action of these metabolic modifiers is to increase muscle deposition while often simultaneously reducing fat depositionhowever there have been some concerns that the focus on increasing production efficiency and lean meat yield has been to the detriment of meat qualitythe aim of this review is to collate data on the effects of these metabolic modifiers on meat quality and then discuss these overall effectswhen data from the literature are collated and subject to metaanalyses it appears that conservative use of each of these technologies will result in a 510 0305kg increase in shear force with a similar reduction in perception of tendernesshowever it should be borne in mind that the magnitude of these increases are similar to those observed with similar increases in carcass leanness obtained through other means egnutritional genetic selection and may be an inherent consequence of the production of leaner meatto counter this there are some other metabolic factors and dietary additives that offer some potential to improve meat quality for example immuncastration and it is possible that these can be used on their own or in conjunction with somatotropin approved Î²agonists anabolic implants and cla to maintain or improve meat quality
