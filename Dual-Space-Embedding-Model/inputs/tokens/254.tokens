background to determine whether there is an association between diet and plasma insulin concentration that is independent of obesity we studied the relation of dietary composition and caloric intake to obesity and plasma insulin concentrations in 215 nondiabetic men aged 3274 years with angiographically proven coronary artery diseasemethods and results after adjusting for age the intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol were positively correlated p less than 005 with body mass index r  018 r  016 waisttohip circumference ratio r  021 r  022 and fasting insulin r  026 r  023carbohydrate intake was negatively correlated with body mass index r  021 waisttohip ratio r  021 and fasting insulin r  016intake of monounsaturated fatty acids did not correlate significantly with body mass index or waisttohip circumference ratio but did correlate positively with fasting insulin r  024intake of dietary calories was negatively correlated with body mass index r  015in multivariate analysis intake of saturated fatty acids was significantly related to elevated fasting insulin concentration independently of body mass indexconclusions these crosssectional findings in nondiabetic men with coronary artery disease suggest that increased consumption of saturated fatty acids is associated independently with higher fasting insulin concentrations
