under farm conditions aggression related to the formation of social hierarchy and competition for resources can be a major problem because of associated injuries social stress and carcass lossesany factor that may affect the regulation and amount of aggression within a farmed system for instance feeding the betaadrenoreceptor agonist ractopamine rac is therefore worthy of investigationthe objectives of this study were to assess the effects of the widely used swine feed additive rac considering also the effects of sex and social rank on aggressiveness and concentrations of brain amines neurotransmitters essential for controlling aggression in finishing pigsthirtytwo barrows and 32 gilts 4 pigspen by sex were fed either a control diet or a diet with rac paylean elanco animal health greenfield in added 5 mgkg for 2 wk followed by 10 mgkg for 2 wkthe top dominant and bottom subordinate pigs 16 pigssex in each pen were determined after mixing by a 36h period of continuous behavioral observationthese pigs were then subjected to residentintruder tests maximum 300 s during the feeding trial to measure aggressivenessat the end of wk 4 the amygdala frontal cortex hypothalamus and raphe nuclei were dissected and analyzed for concentrations of dopamine da serotonin 5ht their metabolites 34dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid dopac and homovanillic acid and 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5hiaa respectively norepinephrine and epinephrine using hplcractopaminefed gilts performed more attacks during the first 30 s of testing than pigs in all other subgroups p  005by the end of the residentintruder test 300 s the dominant control gilts and barrows and both dominant and subordinate racfed gilts performed the greatest percentage of attacks p  005gilts had decreased norepinephrine and dopac concentrations in the amygdala and frontal cortex and when fed rac gilts also had the least 5hiaa concentration and greatest da turnover rate in the amygdala p  005the 5ht concentration was less in the frontal cortex of gilts compared with barrows and in the raphe nuclei single site for brain 5ht synthesis of dominant gilts p  005ractopamine may be affecting aggressive behavior through indirect action on central regulatory mechanisms such as the da systemthe aggressive pattern observed in the tested pigs especially in gilts is likely linked to brain monoamine profiling of a deficient serotonergic system in the raphe nuclei amygdala and frontal cortex and enhanced da metabolism in the amygdala brain areas vital for aggression regulation
