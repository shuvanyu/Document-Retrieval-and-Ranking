objectives the aim of this study was to examine the independent relationships of television viewing or other screenbased entertainment screen time with allcause mortality and clinically confirmed cardiovascular disease cvd eventsa secondary objective was to examine the extent to which metabolic body mass index highdensity lipoprotein and total cholesterol and inflammatory creactive protein markers mediate the relationship between screen time and cvd eventsbackground although some evidence suggests that prolonged sitting is linked to cvd risk factor development regardless of physical activity participation studies with hard outcomes are scarcemethods a population sample of 4512 1945 men scottish health survey 2003 respondents 35 years were followed up to 2007 for allcause mortality and cvd events fatal and nonfatal combinedmain exposures were interviewerassessed screen time 2 hday 2 to 4 hday and 4 hday and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activityresults two hundred fifteen cvd events and 325 anycause deaths occurred during 19364 followup personyearsthe covariable age sex ethnicity obesity smoking social class longstanding illness marital status diabetes hypertensionadjusted hazard ratio hr for allcause mortality was 152 95 confidence interval ci 106 to 216 and for cvd events was 230 95 ci 133 to 396 for participants engaging in 4 hday of screen time relative to 2 hdayadjusting for physical activity attenuated these associations only slightly allcause mortality hr 148 95 ci 104 to 213 cvd events hr 225 95 ci 130 to 389exclusion of participants with cvd events in the first 2 years of followup and previous cancer registrations did not change these results appreciablyapproximately 25 of the association between screen time and cvd events was explained collectively by creactive protein body mass index and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterolconclusions recreational sitting as reflected by televisionscreen viewing time is related to raised mortality and cvd risk regardless of physical activity participationinflammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this relationshipcopyright Ã¢ 2011 american college of cardiology foundationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
