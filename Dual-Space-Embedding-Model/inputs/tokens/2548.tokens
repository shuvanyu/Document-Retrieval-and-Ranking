daily diet may have implications for skin ageinghowever data on the relationship between diet and the parameters of skin conditions are scarcethe present study aimed to examine the associations of biophysical properties of the skin of women with intakes of fats and antioxidant micronutrients as well as food groups as sources of these nutrientsin a crosssectional study we measured the hydration surface lipids and elasticity of the skin of 716 japanese women using noninvasive techniquesthe extent of facial wrinkles in the crowsfoot area was determined by observation using the daniell scaleeach subjects usual diet was determined with the use of a validated ffqafter controlling for covariates including age smoking status bmi and lifetime sun exposure the results showed that higher intakes of total fat saturated fat and monounsaturated fat were significantly associated with increased skin elasticitya higher intake of green and yellow vegetables was significantly associated with a decreased daniell wrinkling scoreintake of saturated fat was significantly inversely associated with the daniell wrinkling score after additional adjustment for green and yellow vegetable intakefurther studies with more accurate measurement methods are needed to investigate the role of daily diet in skin ageing
