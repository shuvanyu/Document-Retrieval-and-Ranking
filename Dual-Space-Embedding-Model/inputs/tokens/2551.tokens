background postmenopausal conjugated equine estrogens cee therapies increase the risk of cognitive impairment in women aged 65 years or older and are associated with smaller regional brain volumes however the link between these two phenomena has not been establishedmethods standardized magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 1403 women 14 years after they had participated in randomized placebocontrolled clinical trials of ceebased therapieswomen included in this report were aged 6580 years and free of dementia and mild cognitive impairment mci when originally enrolled in the trials which lasted an average of 46 years and were conducted at 14 academic us medical centersthe associations that regional brain volumes and ischemic lesion volumes had with the development of cognitive impairment ie dementia or mci were contrasted between treatment groups using analyses of covarianceresults fiftythree women developed mci or probable dementia during followupamong women who had been prescribed ceebased therapies cognitive impairment was associated with relatively smaller hippocampal p  0002 and total brain volumes p  03qualitatively these associations appeared to be independent of their level of pretreatment cognitive functionamong women who had been prescribed placebo these relationships were not evident instead cognitive impairment was associated with greater ischemic lesion volume in the frontal lobe p  007 and overall p  02conclusion a mechanism by which ceebased postmenopausal hormone therapy induces cognitive impairment appears to be through increased brain atrophy
