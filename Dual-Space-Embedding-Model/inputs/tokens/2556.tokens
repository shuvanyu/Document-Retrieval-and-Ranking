objective the health benefits of vegetarian diets are wellrecognized however longterm adherence to these diets may be associated with nutrient inadequacies particularly vitamins b12 and d calcium iron zinc and proteinthe dietary reference intakes dris expert panels recommended adjustments to the iron zinc and calcium dris for vegetarians to account for decreased bioavailability but no adjustments were considered necessary for the protein dri under the assumption that vegetarians consume about 50 of protein from animal dairyegg sourcesthis study examined dietary protein sources in a convenience sample of 21 young adult vegetarian women who completed food logs on 4 consecutive days 3 weekdays and 1 weekend daymethods the daily contribution percentages of protein consumed from cereals legumes nutsseeds fruitsvegetables and dairyegg were computed and the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score of the daily diets was calculatedresults the calculated total dietary protein digestibility score for participants was 82  1 which differed significantly p  0001 from the dri reference score 88 and the 4d average protein digestibility corrected amino acid score for the sample was 80  2 which also differed significantly p  0001 from the dri reference value 100the analyses indicated that animal protein accounted for only 21 of dietary proteinconclusion this research suggests that the protein dri for vegetarians consuming less than the expected amounts of animal protein 45 to 50 of total protein may need to be adjusted from 08 to about 10 gkg to account for decreased protein bioavailabilitycopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
