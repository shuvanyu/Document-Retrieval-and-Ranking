ergothioneine is a native membraneimpermeable thiol compound that is specifically accumulated in cells via the organic cation transporter octn1in humans octn1 and ergothioneine have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune disordershowever available evidence about dietary sources and the functional role of ergothioneine in human physiology is scarcehere we analyzed the ergothioneine content in common foods using liquid chromatography tandemmass spectrometryadditionally we assessed the protective potency of ergothioneine against various oxidative stressors in octn1expressing cells in comparison with the main intracellular thiol antioxidant glutathione by evaluating cell viability with the mtt reduction assayonly some food contained ergothioneine with highest concentrations detected in specialty mushrooms kidney liver black and red beans and oat branergothioneine exhibited cell protection only against copperiiinduced toxicity but was far less potent than glutathione indicting that ergothioneine is not involved in the intracellular antioxidant thiol defense system
