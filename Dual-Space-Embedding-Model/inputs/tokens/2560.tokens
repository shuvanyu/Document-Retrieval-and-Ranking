antibiotic entry into the water environment has been of growing concernhowever few investigations have been performed to examine the potential for indirect human exposure to environmental antibiotic residueswe evaluated the contribution of drinking water and major food consumption to inadvertent intake of antibiotic residues among general human population in koreawe estimated daily human intake of six antibiotics ie sulfamethazine smz sulfamethoxazole smx sulfathiazole stz trimethoprim tmp enrofloxacin efx and roxithromycin rtm by measuring the concentrations of the antibiotics and their major metabolites in urine from general population in korea n541in addition we measured antibiotics from source water of drinking water as well as in tap water samples and surveyed water consumption rates among the study populationto assess the contribution of dietary factor we also surveyed consumption pattern for several major foods which are suspected of antibiotics residuesmz sulfamethazinen4acetyl smzn4 tmp efx ciprofloxacin cfx and rtm were detected up to 448 6210 11900 6970 32400 and 151pgml in the urine samples respectivelyestimates of daily intake of major antibiotics did not appear to be related with consumption of drinking water although antibiotics were frequently detected in source waters 1067nglconsumption of several foods correlated significantly with urinary excretion of several antibioticsdaily intake estimates of efx and cfx were associated with consumption of beef pork and dairy products those of smz and tmp associated with pork and dairy products and that of tmp related with raw fishdaily antibiotics intake estimates however did not exceed the acceptable daily intake levelscopyright 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
