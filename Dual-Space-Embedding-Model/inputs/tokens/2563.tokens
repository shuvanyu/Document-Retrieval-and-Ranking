researchers have long debated the adverse effects of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs on children versus the benefits of breastfeedingin this article the authors provide an overview of the known health effects of pcbs in children and examine the level of evidence regarding the risk of postnatal exposure via breastfeedingthe major source of pcbs is environmental with over 90 of human exposure through the food chainpcb exposure in infants is predominantly via breast milk but limited evidence exists of significant toxicity associated with this mode of transmissionbreastfeeding should therefore continue to be encouraged on the basis of evidence of the benefits derived from human milk coupled with inconclusive proof that lactational pcb exposure has major detrimental effects on the overall health and development of infants
