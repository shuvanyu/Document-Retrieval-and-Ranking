we studied pregnancyrelated changes in serum concentrations of five polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs cb 118 cb 138 cb 153 cb 156 cb 180 three hydroxylated pcb metabolites 4ohcb107 4ohcb146 4ohcb187 and pentachlorophenol pcpmedian serum lipid content increased 2fold between early weeks 913 and late pregnancy weeks 3536 n10 whereas median pcb levels in serum lipids decreased 2046 suggesting a dilution of pcb concentrations in serum lipidsnevertheless strong positive intraindividual correlations spearmans r061099 were seen for pcbs during the whole study periodthus if samples have been collected within the same relative narrow time window during pregnancy pcb results from one single sampling occasion can be used in assessment of relative differences in body burdens during the whole pregnancy periodconcentrations of ohpcbs in blood serum tended to decline as pregnancy progressed although among some women the concentrations increased at the end of pregnancypositive intraindividual correlations r066099 between ohpcb concentrations were observed during the first and second trimester whereas correlations with third trimester concentrations were more diverging r070085no decline in pcp concentrations was observed during pregnancy and no significant correlations were found between concentrations at different sampling periodsour results suggest that for both ohpcbs and pcp sampling has to be more specifically timed depending on the time period during pregnancy that is of interestthe differences in patterns of intra and interindividual variability of the studied compounds may be due to a combination of factors including lipid solubility persistence of the compounds distribution in blood metabolic formation and pregnancyrelated changes in body composition and physiological processescopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
