objective to assess the public health significance of premature weaning of infants from breast milk on laterlife risk of chronic illnessdesign a review and summary of recent metaanalyses of studies linking premature weaning from breast milk with laterlife chronic disease risk is presented followed by an estimation of the approximate exposure in a developed western country based on historical breastfeeding prevalence data for australia since 1927the populationattributable proportion of chronic disease associated with current patterns of artificial feeding in infancy is estimatedresults after adjustment for major confounding variables current research suggests that the risks of chronic disease are 30200  higher in those who were not breastfed compared to those who were breastfed in infancyexposure to premature weaning ranges from 20  to 90  in postworld war ii age cohortsoverall the attributable proportion of chronic disease in the population is estimated at 624  for a 30  exposure to premature weaningconclusions breastfeeding is of public health significance in preventing chronic diseasethere is a small but consistent effect of premature weaning from breast milk in increasing laterlife chronic disease riskrisk exposure in the australian population is substantialapproximately 90  of current 3545yearolds were weaned from breastfeeding by 6 months of ageencouraging greater duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is a potential avenue for reducing future chronic disease burden and health system costs
