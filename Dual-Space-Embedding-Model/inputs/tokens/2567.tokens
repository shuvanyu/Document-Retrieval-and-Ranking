perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride based compounds have been used in a wide variety of consumer products such as carpets upholstery and textilesthese compounds degrade to perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos a persistent metabolite that accumulates in tissues of humans and wildlifeprevious studies have reported the occurrence of pfos perfluorohexanesulfonate pfhxs perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonamide pfosa in human sera collected from the united statesin this study concentrations of pfos pfhxs pfoa and pfosa were measured in 473 human bloodserumplasma samples collected from the united states colombia brazil belgium italy poland india malaysia and koreaamong the four perfluorochemicals measured pfos was the predominant compound found in bloodconcentrations of pfos were the highest in the samples collected from the united states and poland 30 ngml moderate in korea belgium malaysia brazil italy and colombia 3 to 29 ngml and lowest in india 3 ngmlpfoa was the next most abundant perfluorochemical in blood samples although the frequency of occurrence of this compound was relatively lowno age or genderrelated differences in the concentrations of pfos and pfoa were found in serum samplesthe degree of association between the concentrations of four perfluorochemicals varied depending on the origin of the samplesthese results suggested the existence of sources with varying levels and compositions of perfluorochemicals and differences in exposure patterns to these chemicals in various countriesin addition to the four target fluorochemicals measured qualitative analysis of selected blood samples showed the presence of other perfluorochemicals such as perfluorodecanesulfonate pfds perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorononanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa and perfluoroundecanoic acid pfunda in serum samples at concentrations approximately 5 to 10fold lower than the concentration of pfosfurther studies should focus on identifying sources and pathways of human exposure to perfluorochemicals
