in this study 10 perfluorochemicals pfcs were measured in meat meat products and eggs and in indoor dust collected in chinaperfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos were the most frequently detected pfcs in these samplesmean concentrations of pfos and pfoa in foodstuffs were in the range of 005199 ngg fresh wt and 006125 ngg fresh wt respectivelythe mean concentrations of pfoa perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa and pfos in indoor dust were 205 140 and 486 ngg dry wt respectivelythe estimated daily intake of pfos and pfoa from meat meat products and eggs edimeateggs ranged from 600 to 964 ngd and from 254 to 576 ngd respectively when the values below the limit of quantitation loq were assigned as 0 and from 880 to 150 ngd and from 255 to 577 ngd respectively when the values below the loq were set at 12loqthe edimeateggs of pfos and pfoa increased with increasing family incomethe estimated daily intake of pfos and pfoa through inhalation of dust edidust ranged from 023 to 031 ngd and from 968 to 134 ngd respectivelythe daily intakes of pfos and pfoa from the consumption of meat meat products and eggs and from dust ingestion as calculated from our samples in this study were compared with estimated daily intake of pfcs reported from the concentrations in drinking water fish and seafood from chinaour calculations indicate that dietary sources edidietary account for the overwhelming proportion of 99 for pfos and 98 for pfoa total daily intake tdi in adultsthe analyzed foodstuffs meat meat products and eggs were not the major contributors to dietary exposure to pfos whereas meat was the primary contributor to dietary exposure to pfoa
