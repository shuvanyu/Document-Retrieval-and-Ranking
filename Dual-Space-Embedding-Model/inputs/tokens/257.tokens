the relations of dietary habits to insulin sensitivity and postprandial triglyceride metabolism were evaluated in 25 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash and 25 age body mass index bmi and gendermatched healthy controlsafter a 7day alimentary record they underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test ogtt and the insulin sensitivity index isi was calculated from the ogtt an oral fat load test was also performed in 15 patients and 15 controlsthe dietary intake of nash patients was richer in saturated fat 137  31 vs 100  21 total kcal respectively p 0001 and in cholesterol 506  108 vs 405  111 mgd respectively p 002 and was poorer in polyunsaturated fat 100  35 vs 145  40 total fat respectively p 0001 fiber 129  41 vs 232  78 gd respectively p 000 and antioxidant vitamins c 843  431 vs 1442  631 mgd respectively p 0001 and e 54  19 vs 87  29 mgd respectively p 0001the isi was significantly lower in nash patients than in controlspostprandial total and very low density lipoproteins triglyceride at 4 hours and 6 hours triglyceride area under the curve and incremental triglyceride area under the curve were higher in nash compared with controlssaturated fat intake correlated with isi with the different features of the metabolic syndrome and with the postprandial rise of triglyceridepostprandial apolipoprotein apo b48 and apob100 responses in nash were flat and strikingly dissociated from the triglyceride response suggesting a defect in apob secretionin conclusion dietary habits may promote steatohepatitis directly by modulating hepatic triglyceride accumulation and antioxidant activity as well as indirectly by affecting insulin sensitivity and postprandial triglyceride metabolismour findings provide further rationale for more specific alimentary interventions particularly in nonobese nondiabetic normolipidemic nash patients
