the aim was to determine halflife of six most abundant pcb congeners in the body of early adolescentsin 304 environmentally exposed children pcb serum concentration was determined at the age of 8 and 12yearshalflife was determined for each child assuming exponential decrease or for the whole cohort using multiple regressionresults obtained by both approaches were in agreementpcb reuptakes corrupting halflife estimates for each child and each congener were evaluatedif one of the serum pcb concentration values fell below the level of detection lod the pair was excluded and if pcb halflife value exceeded the arbitrary value of 30yearsthe following median halflives in years 446 1059 97 47 91 and 98 were obtained for pcb congeners 118 138163 153 156171 170 and 180 respectivelythe elimination halflife values were not systematically related to pcb serum concentration at any examination agebetween halflife values percentage of children with significant reuptakes and pcb congener abundance in serum were found significant associationscopyright Ã¢ 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
