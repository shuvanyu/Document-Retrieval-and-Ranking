polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde body burdens in the general us population have been linked to the consumption of red meat and poultryexposure estimates have also indicated that meat products are a major contributor to pbde dietary intaketo establish solid estimates of pbde concentrations in domestic meat and poultry samples from two statistically designed surveys of us meat and poultry were analyzed for pbdesthe two surveys were conducted in 20022003 and 20072008 between which times the manufacturing of pentabde and octabde formulations had ceased in the united states december 2004thus the data provided an opportunity to observe prevalence and concentration trends that may have occurred during this time frame and to compare the mean pbde levels among the meat and poultry industrieson the basis of composite samples the average sum of the seven most prevalent pbdes bde28 47 99 100 153 154 and 183 decreased by 60 from 195 ngg lipid in 20022003 to 072 ngg lipid in 20072008 for meat and poultrypbdes measured in individual samples in 2008 showed that beef samples had the lowest pbde levels followed by hogs and chickens and then by turkeysthe pbde congener pattern was the same for both surveys and resembled the pentabde formulation with bde47 and 99 accounting for 30 and 40 of the total respectivelyon the basis of the data from the two surveys it appears that pbde levels in us meat and poultry have declined since manufacturing ceased however exposure pathways of pbdes to livestock are still not known
