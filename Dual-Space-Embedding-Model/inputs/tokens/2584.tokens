in this review recent publications are cited for a number of antimutagensthe molecules surveyed are potential or proven desmutagens or interceptorsthese are biologically prevalent or synthetic molecules that are most often small metabolites proficient in binding to or reacting with mutagenic chemicals and free radicalsmany of this class of blocking agents are soft and hard nucleophiles with consequently varying abilities to react with particular classes of electrophiles the major classes of directacting mutagensalthough they serve as a first line of defense against mutagens and carcinogens many interceptor molecules are underinvestigated with regard to their spectra of activity and their possible relevance to prophylaxis or treatment of human disease states
