interest in dietary phytochemicals for potential cancer chemoprevention has increased substantiallyscreening dietary compounds for chemopreventive activity however requires a systematic and wideranging approach to encompass the complexity of carcinogenesiswe present some of the molecular pathways that underpin the broad biological processes involved in carcinogenesisoxidative stress inflammation and the evasion of apoptosis are important biological mechanisms by which carcinogenesis occurssubsequently antioxidant antiinflammatory and proapoptotic activity represent important activities for preventing suppressing or reversing the development of carcinogenesisultimately these mechanisms of action may provide a useful basis for screening novel phytochemicals for chemopreventive activityin this review we identify the important molecular processes that may be targeted in routine screenings of dietary phytochemicals to ultimately select the most effective potential candidates for cancer chemoprevention
