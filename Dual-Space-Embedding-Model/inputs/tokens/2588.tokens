in this study silkworm moth bombyx mori l larvae were regarded as an animal protein source for astronauts in the bioregenerative life support system during longterm deep space exploration in the futurethey were fed with mulberry and stem lettuce leaves during the first three instars and the last two instars respectivelyin addition this kind of environmental approach which utilised inedible biomass of plants to produce animal protein of high quality can likewise be applied terrestrially to provide food for people living in extreme environments andor impoverished agroecosystems such as in polar regions isolated military bases ships submarines etcrespiration characteristics of the larvae during development under two main physiological conditions namely eating and noteating of leaves were studiednutrient compositions of silkworm powder sp ground and freezedried silkworms on the 3rd day of the 5th instar larvae including protein fat vitamins minerals and fatty acids were measured using international standard methodssilkworms respiration rates measured when larvae were eating mulberry leaves were higher than those of similar larvae that hadnt eaten such leavesthere was a significant difference between silkworms fed on mulberry leaves and those fed on stem lettuce in the 4th and 5th instars p001amounts of co2 exhaled by the silkworms under the two physiological regimes differed from each other p001there was also a significant difference between the amount of o2 inhaled when the insects were under the two physiological statuses p001moreover silkworms respiration quotient under the eating regime was larger than when under the noteating regimethe sp was found to be rich in protein and amino acids in total 12 essential vitamins nine minerals and twelve fatty acids were detectedmoreover 359 kcal could be generated per 100 gram of sp dry weight
