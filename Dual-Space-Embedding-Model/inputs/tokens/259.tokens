the steady rise in western obesity rates has been closely linked to significant increases in a multitude of accompanying health problems including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldnafld severity ranges from simple steatosis to acute steatohepatitis but the molecular mechanisms controlling progression of this disease are poorly understoodrecent literature suggests that elevated free fatty acids ffas especially saturated ffas may play an important role in lipotoxic mechanisms both in experimental models and in nafld patientsthis review highlights important cellular pathways involved in hepatic lipotoxicity and how the degree of intrahepatic lipid saturation controls cell fate in response to an elevated ffa loadrelevant cellular processes that have been causally linked to lipidinduced apoptosis known as lipoapoptosis include endoplasmic reticulum er stress oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and jun nterminal kinase jnk signalingin contrast increased triglyceride synthesis has been shown to have a protective effect against lipotoxicity despite being one of the hallmark traits of naflddeveloping a more nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nafld progression will lead to more targeted and effective therapeutics for this increasingly prevalent disease which to date has no proven pharmacologic treatment to prevent or reverse its course
