soya foods may protect against the development of breast cancerinsulinlike growth factor igf1 is under investigation as a possible link between nutrition and cancerwe examined the effect of soya foods on circulating igf1 and igf binding protein bp3 levels among 196 healthy premenopausal women in a 2year randomised nutritional trialthe intervention group consumed two daily servings of soya foods including tofu soya milk soya nuts and soya protein powder equivalent to 50 mg isoflavones and 522 g soya protein per serving the controls maintained their regular dietfive serum samples at baseline 3 6 12 and 24 months were collected in the morning during the luteal phase and analysed for igf1 and igfbp3 by doubleantibody elisawe applied mixed models to investigate the intervention effect and predictors of serum levels while considering the repeated measurement designadherence with the study regimen was high and dropout rates were acceptablerandomisation resulted in similar mean igf1 and igfbp3 levels by groupwe did not observe a significant intervention effect on igf1 igfbp3 and their molar ratio during the entire study periodhowever urinary isoflavone excretion during the study period was positively associated with igf1 p004 and the igf1igfbp3 ratio p006the effect was consistent over timeadding soya foods to the diet of premenopausal women does not appear to lower serum levels of igf1 and igfbp3 if anything the greater protein intake from soya may lead to a small increase in igf1 serum levels
