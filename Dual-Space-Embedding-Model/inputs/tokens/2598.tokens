objective accumulating evidence indicates that prostate cancer is associated with high levels of serum igfithis study was conducted to determine whether a lowfat diet and exercise de intervention may modulate the igf axis and reduce prostate cancer cell growth in vitromethods fasting serum was obtained from 14 men age 60  3 years participating in an 11day de program and from eight similarly aged men who had followed the de program for 142  17 years longterminsulin igfi igfbp1 and igfbp3 were measured by elisa and serum was used to stimulate lncap cell growth in vitroresults serum igfi levels decreased by 20 while igfbp1 increased by 53 after 11day dein the longterm group igfi was 55 lower while igfbp1 was 150 higher relative to baselineserum insulin decreased by 25 after 11day de and was 68 lower in the longterm group relative to baselineno changes in serum igfbp3 were observedserumstimulated lncap cell growth was reduced by 30 in post11day serum and by 44 in longterm serum relative to baselinelncap cells incubated with postde serum showed increased apoptosis necrosis compared to baselineconclusions a lowfat diet and exercise intervention induces invivo changes in the circulating igf axis and is associated with reduced growth and enhanced apoptosisnecrosis of lncap tumor cells in vitro
