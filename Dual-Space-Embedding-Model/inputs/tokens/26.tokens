objective fructose intake has increased considerably in the united states primarily as a result of increased consumption of highfructose corn syrup fruits and juices and crystalline fructosethe purpose was to determine how often fructose in amounts commonly consumed would result in malabsorption andor symptoms in healthy personsdesign fructose absorption was measured using 3hour breath hydrogen tests and symptom scores were used to rate subjective responses for gas borborygmus abdominal pain and loose stoolssubjectssetting the study included 15 normal freeliving volunteers from a medical center community and was performed in a gastrointestinal specialty clinicintervention subjects consumed 25 and 50g doses of crystalline fructose with water after an overnight fast on separate test daysmain outcome measures mean peak breath hydrogen time of peak area under the curve auc for breath hydrogen and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured during a 3hour period after subjects consumed both 25 and 50g doses of fructosestatistical analyses differences in mean breath hydrogen auc and symptom scores between doses were analyzed using paired t testscorrelations among peak breath hydrogen auc and symptoms were also evaluatedresults more than half of the 15 adults tested showed evidence of fructose malabsorption after 25 g fructose and greater than two thirds showed malabsorption after 50 g fructoseauc representing overall breath hydrogen response was significantly greater after the 50g doseoverall symptom scores were significantly greater than baseline after each dose but scores were only marginally greater after 50 g than 25 g peak hydrogen levels and auc were highly correlated but neither was significantly related to symptomsconclusions fructose in amounts commonly consumed may result in mild gastrointestinal distress in normal peopleadditional study is warranted to evaluate the response to fructoseglucose mixtures as in highfructose corn syrup and fructose taken with food in both normal people and those with gastrointestinal dysfunctionbecause breath hydrogen peaks occurred at 90 to 114 minutes and were highly correlated with 180minute breath hydrogen auc the use of peak hydrogen measures may be considered to shorten the duration of the exam
