insulinlike growth factors igfi igfii and their binding proteins igfbp16 play a key role in cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesisseveral epidemiological studies show associations of igfs with prostate cancerwe searched the published literature for all studies relating levels of igfs or igfbps with prostate cancerwe performed random effects metaanalysis to calculate summary odds ratiosthe number of studies prostate cancer cases included in each metaanalysis were 42 7481 igfi 10 923 igfii 3 485 igfbp1 5 577 igfbp2 29 6541 igfbp3 and 11 3545 igf1igfbp3 ratiothe pooled odds ratios 95 confidence intervals per standard deviation increase in peptide were igfi or  121 107 136 igfii or  117 093 147 igfbp1 or  121 062 233 igfbp2 or  118 090 154 igfbp3 or  088 079 098 igfiigfbp3 ratio or  110 097 124for all exposures there was substantial heterogeneity all i2  75 partly explained by study design the magnitude of associations was smaller in prospective versus retrospective studies and for igfbp3 the inverse association with prostate cancer risk was seen in retrospective but not prospective studiesthere was weak evidence that associations of igfi and igfbp3 with prostate cancer were stronger for advanced diseaseour metaanalysis confirms that raised circulating lgfi is positively associated with prostate cancer riskassociations between igfbp3 and prostate cancer were inconsistent and there was little evidence for a role of igfii igfbp1 or igfbp2 in prostate cancer risk
