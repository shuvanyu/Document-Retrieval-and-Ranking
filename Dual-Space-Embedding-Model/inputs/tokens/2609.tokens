objectives dietary fat and fiber affect hormonal levels and may influence cancer progressionflaxseed is a rich source of lignan and omega3 fatty acids and may thwart prostate cancerthe potential effects of flaxseed may be enhanced with concomitant fat restrictionwe undertook a pilot study to explore whether a flaxseedsupplemented fatrestricted diet could affect the biomarkers of prostatic neoplasiamethods twentyfive patients with prostate cancer who were awaiting prostatectomy were instructed on a lowfat 20 of kilocalories or less flaxseedsupplemented 30 gday dietthe baseline and followup levels of prostatespecific antigen testosterone free androgen index and total serum cholesterol were determinedthe tumors of diettreated patients were compared with those of historic cases matched by age race prostatespecific antigen level at diagnosis and biopsy gleason sum with respect to apoptosis terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase tdtmediated dutpbiotin nick endlabeling tunel and proliferation mib1results the average duration on the diet was 34 days range 21 to 77 during which time significant decreases were observed in total serum cholesterol 201  39 mgdl to 174  42 mgdl total testosterone 422  122 ngdl to 360  128 ngdl and free androgen index 363  189 to 293  168 all p 005the baseline and followup levels of prostatespecific antigen were 81  52 ngml and 85  77 ngml respectively for the entire sample p  058 however among men with gleason sums of 6 or less n  19 the psa values were 71  39 ngml and 64  41 ngml p  010the mean proliferation index was 74  78 for the historic controls versus 50  49 for the diettreated patients p  005the distribution of the apoptotic indexes differed significantly p  001 between groups with most historic controls exhibiting tunel categorical scores of 0 diettreated patients largely exhibited scores of 1both the proliferation rate and apoptosis were significantly associated with the number of days on the diet p  0049 and p  0017 respectivelyconclusions these pilot data suggest that a flaxseedsupplemented fatrestricted diet may affect prostate cancer biology and associated biomarkersfurther study is needed to determine the benefit of this dietary regimen as either a complementary or preventive therapy
