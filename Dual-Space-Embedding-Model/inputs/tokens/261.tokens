aimshypothesis defects in pancreatic beta cell turnover are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by genetic markers for diabetesdecreased beta cell neogenesis could contribute to diabetesthe longevity and turnover of human beta cells is unknown in rodents 1 year old a halflife of 30 days is estimatedintracellular lipofuscin body lb accumulation is a hallmark of ageing in neuronsto estimate the lifespan of human beta cells we measured beta cell lb accumulation in individuals aged 181 yearsmethods lb content was determined by electron microscopical morphometry in sections of beta cells from human nondiabetic n  45 type 2 diabetic n  10 and nonhuman primates n  10 530 years and from 15 mice aged 1099 weekstotal cellular lb content was estimated by threedimensional 3d mathematical modellingresults lb area proportion was significantly correlated with age in human and nonhuman primatesthe proportion of human lbpositive beta cells was significantly related to age with no apparent differences in type 2 diabetes or obesitylb content was low in human insulinomas n  5 and alpha cells and in mouse beta cells lb content in mouse 10 humanusing 3d electron microscopy and 3d mathematical modelling the lbpositive human beta cells representing aged cells increased from or90 10 years to or97 20 years and remained constant thereafterconclusionsinterpretation human beta cells unlike those of young rodents are longlivedlb proportions in type 2 diabetes and obesity suggest that little adaptive change occurs in the adult human beta cell population which is largely established by age 20 years
