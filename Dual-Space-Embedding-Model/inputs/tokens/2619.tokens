background and aims virgin olive oil voo and nuts are basic components of the mediterranean diet a hearthealthy dietary patternnuts have well known cholesterol lowering effects while evidence is unclear for voowe designed a study in hypercholesterolemic patients to assess the effects on serum lipids and other intermediate markers of cardiovascular risk of replacing 40 of the fat in the background diet with voo walnuts or almondsmethods and results after a 4 week runin period with a healthy diet eligible candidates were randomized into three diet sequences in a crossover design with a common background diet enriched with voo walnuts or almonds lasting 4 weeks eachoutcomes were changes of serum lipids and oxidation and inflammation markers measured by standard methodsplasma fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography to assess compliancein 18 participants completing the study 9 women mean age 56 y bmi 257 kgm2 ldlcholesterol was reduced from baseline by 73 108 and 134 after the voo walnut and almond diets respectively p  0001 friedman testtotal cholesterol and ldlhdl ratios decreased in parallelldlcholesterol decreases were greater than predicted from dietary fatty acid and cholesterol exchanges among dietsno changes of other lipid fractions oxidation analytes or inflammatory biomarkers were observedplasma fatty acid changes after each diet sequence supported good complianceconclusion the results confirm the cholesterol lowering properties of nutenriched dietsthey also suggest that phenolicrich voo has a cholesterol lowering effect independently of its fatty acid content which clearly deserves further studycopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
