the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of body mass index abdomenhip ratio and dietary intake to fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations among 652 men aged 4385 y followed in the normative aging studylogtransformed fasting insulin was significantly associated with body mass index abdomenhip ratio total fat energy and saturated fatty acid energy with correlation coefficients ranging from 014 for total fat to 045 for body mass indexwhen multivariate models were used body mass index abdomenhip ratio and saturated fatty acid intake were statistically significant independent predictors of both fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations after age cigarette smoking and physical activity were adjusted forif saturated fatty acids as a percentage of total energy were to decrease from 14 to 8 there would be an 18 decrease in fasting insulin and a 25 decrease in postprandial insulinthese data suggest that overall adiposity abdominal obesity and a diet high in saturated fatty acids are independent predictors for both fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations
