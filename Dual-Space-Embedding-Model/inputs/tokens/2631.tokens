the relative proportion of bacteroidetes to firmicutes is decreased in obese peoplethis imbalance in gut microbiota generates signals controlling the expression of genes by the epithelial intestinal cellsboth dairy and nondairy probiotics increase body weight reportedly through lactobacillus species growth in the guton the other hand daily intake of some fruits and drinks such as three apples or three pears or grapefruit or green tea which all are rich in polyphenols can significantly reduce body weight in obese peoplemetabolism of polyphenols by microbiota involves the cleavage of glycosidic linkagesglycans which are the product of glycosidic cleavage are necessary for survival of the intestinal microbiota as a nutrient foundationthere are two pivotal points i firmicutes possess a disproportionately smaller number of glycandegrading enzymes than bacteroidetes ii firmicutes are more repressed than the bacteroidetes by phenolic compounds antimicrobial propertiesthe bacteroidetes community prevails following dietary polyphenol intake and its fermentation to phenolic compounds due to having more glycandegrading enzymes so this may thus be a mechanism by which dietary polyphenols exert their weight lowering effecti suggest that future studies utilize clone libraries and fingerprinting techniques enabling identification of the composition and community structure of the microbiota and dot blot hybridization or fluorescent in situ hybridization to analyze abundance of particular taxa in obese and individualsa supplementation with polyphenols with high bioavailability in obese individuals with higher firmicutesbacteroides community ratio phenotype when associated to a probiotic restricted diet is proposed for weight loss this hypothesis could have relevant implication in planning a successful dietary regimen andor neutraceuticalpharmaceutical preparations for achieving and maintaining a normal body weight in obese individuals especially including much more use of polyphenolrich foodstuffs andor polyphenolrich syrups and including low amounts of probioticrich foodstuffs like yogurt soy yogurt or as probiotic supplementscopyright  2010 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
