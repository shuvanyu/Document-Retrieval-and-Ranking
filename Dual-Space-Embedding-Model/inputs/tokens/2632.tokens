the aim of our studies was to determine the amount of polyphenols reaching the colon after oral intake of apple juice and blueberriesafter a polyphenolfree diet healthy ileostomy volunteers consumed a polyphenolrich cloudy apple juice while others consumed anthocyaninrich blueberriesileostomy effluent was collected and polyphenols were identified using hplcdad as well as hplcesimsms quantification was performed with hplcdadmost of the orally administered apple polyphenols were absorbed from or metabolized in the small intestinebetween 0 and 33 of the oral dose was recovered in the ileostomy bags with a maximum of excretion after 2 h a higher amount of the blueberry anthocyanins under study up to 85 depending on the sugar moiety were determined in the ileostomy bags and therefore would reach the colon under physiological circumstancessuch structurerelated availability has to be considered when polyphenols are used in model systems to study potential preventive effects in colorectal diseases
