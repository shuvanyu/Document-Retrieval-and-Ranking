dietary fibres are indigestible food ingredients that reach the colon and are then fermented by colonic bacteria resulting mainly in the formation of shortchain fatty acids scfa such as acetate propionate and butyratethose scfa especially butyrate are recognised for their potential to act on secondary chemoprevention by slowing growth and activating apoptosis in colon cancer cellsadditionally scfa can also act on primary prevention by activation of different drug metabolising enzymesthis can reduce the burden of carcinogens and therefore decrease the number of mutations reducing cancer riskactivation of gsts by butyrate has been studied on mrna protein and enzyme activity level by realtime rtpcr cdna microarrays western blotting or photometrical approaches respectivelybutyrate had differential effects in colon cells of different stages of cancer developmentin ht29 tumour cells eg mrna gsta4 gstp1 gstm2 and gstt2 were inducedin lt97 adenoma cells gstm3 gstt2 and mgst3 were induced whereas gsta2 gstt2 and catalase cat were elevated in primary colon cellscolon cells of different stages of carcinogenesis differed in posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms because butyrate increased protein levels of different gst isoforms and total gst enzyme activity in ht29 cells whereas in lt97 cells gst protein levels and activity were slightly reducedbecause butyrate increased histone acetylation and phosphorylation of erk in ht29 cells inhibition of histone deacetylases and the influence on mapk signalling are possible mechanisms of gst activation by butyratefunctional consequences of this activation include a reduction of dna damage caused by carcinogens like hydrogen peroxide or 4hydroxynonenal hne in butyratetreated colon cellstreatment of colon cells with the supernatant from an in vitro fermentation of inulin increased gst activity and decreased hneinduced dna damage in ht29 cellsadditional animal and human studies are needed to define the exact role of dietary fibre and butyrate in inducing gst activity and reducing the risk of colon cancer
