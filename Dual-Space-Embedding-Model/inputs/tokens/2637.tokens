over the past 20 years growing interest in the biochemistry nutrition and pharmacology of larginine has led to extensive studies to explore its nutritional and therapeutic roles in treating and preventing human metabolic disordersemerging evidence shows that dietary larginine supplementation reduces adiposity in genetically obese rats dietinduced obese rats finishing pigs and obese human subjects with type2 diabetes mellitusthe mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of larginine are likely complex but ultimately involve altering the balance of energy intake and expenditure in favor of fat loss or reduced growth of white adipose tissuerecent studies indicate that larginine supplementation stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and brown adipose tissue development possibly through the enhanced synthesis of cellsignaling molecules eg nitric oxide carbon monoxide polyamines cgmp and camp as well as the increased expression of genes that promote wholebody oxidation of energy substrates eg glucose and fatty acids thus larginine holds great promise as a safe and costeffective nutrient to reduce adiposity increase muscle mass and improve the metabolic profile in animals and humans
