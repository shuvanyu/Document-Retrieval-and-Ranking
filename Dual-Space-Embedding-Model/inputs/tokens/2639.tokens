nuts are rich sources of multiple nutrients and phytochemicals associated with health benefits including reduced cardiovascular disease riskthis has prompted recommendations to increase their consumptionhowever they are also high in fat and are energy densethe associations between these properties positive energy balance and body weight raise questions about such recommendationsnumerous epidemiological and clinical studies show that nuts are not associated with weight gainmechanistic studies indicate this is largely attributable to the high satiety and low metabolizable energy poor bioaccessibility leading to inefficient energy absorption properties of nutscompensatory dietary responses account for 5575 of the energy provided by nutslimited data suggest that routine nut consumption is associated with elevated resting energy expenditure and the thermogenic effect of feeding resulting in dissipation of another portion of the energy they provideadditionally trials contrasting weight loss through regimens that include or exclude nuts indicate improved compliance and greater weight loss when nuts are permittednuts may be included in the diet in moderation to enhance palatability nutrient quality and chronic disease risk reduction without compromising weight loss or maintenance
