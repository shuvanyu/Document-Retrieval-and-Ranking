background and aims nut intake has been inversely related to body mass index bmi in prospective studieswe examined dietary determinants of adiposity in an elderly mediterranean population with customarily high nut consumptionmethods and results a crosssectional study was conducted in 847 subjects 56 women mean age 67 years bmi 297kgm2 at high cardiovascular risk recruited into the predimed studyfood consumption was evaluated by a validated semiquantitative questionnaire energy expenditure in physical activity by the minnesota leisure time activity questionnaire and anthropometric variables by standard measurementsnut intake decreased across quintiles of both bmi and waist circumference ptrend 0005 bothalcohol ingestion was inversely related to bmi ptrend0020 and directly to waist ptrend0011 while meat intake was directly associated with waist circumference ptrend0018in fully adjusted multivariable models independent dietary associations of bmi were the intake of nuts inversely p0002 and that of meat and meat products directly p0042for waist circumference independent dietary associations were intake of nuts p0002 and vegetables p0040 both inversely and intake of meat and meat products directly p0009from the regression coefficients it was predicted that bmi and waist circumference decreased by 078kgm2 and 21cm respectively for each serving of 30g of nutsresults were similar in men and womenconclusion nut consumption was inversely associated with adiposity independently of other lifestyle variablesit remains to be explored whether residual confounding related to a healthier lifestyle of nut eaters might in part explain these resultscopyright  2009 elsevier bv all rights reserved
