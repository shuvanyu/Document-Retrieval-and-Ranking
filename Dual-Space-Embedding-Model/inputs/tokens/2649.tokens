the evolution of the human diet over the past 10000 years from a paleolithic diet to our current modern pattern of intake has resulted in profound changes in feeding behaviorshifts have occurred from diets high in fruits vegetables lean meats and seafood to processed foods high in sodium and hydrogenated fats and low in fiberthese dietary changes have adversely affected dietary parameters known to be related to health resulting in an increase in obesity and chronic disease including cardiovascular disease cvd diabetes and cancersome intervention trials using paleolithic dietary patterns have shown promising results with favorable changes in cvd and diabetes risk factorshowever such benefits may be offset by disadvantages of the paleolithic diet which is low in vitamin d and calcium and high in fish potentially containing environmental toxinsmore advantageous would be promotion of foods and food ingredients from our ancestral era that have been shown to possess health benefits in the form of functional foodsmany studies have investigated the health benefits of various functional food ingredients including omega3 fatty acids polyphenols fiber and plant sterolsthese bioactive compounds may help to prevent and reduce incidence of chronic diseases which in turn could lead to health cost savings ranging from 2 to 3 billion per year as estimated by case studies using omega3 and plant sterols as examplesthus public health benefits should result from promotion of the positive components of paleolithic diets as functional foods
