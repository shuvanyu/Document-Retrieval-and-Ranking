background epidemiological studies have consistently associated nut consumption with reduced risk for coronary heart diseasesubsequently many dietary intervention trials investigated the effects of nut consumption on blood lipid levelsthe objectives of this study were to estimate the effects of nut consumption on blood lipid levels and to examine whether different factors modify the effectsmethods we pooled individual primary data from 25 nut consumption trials conducted in 7 countries among 583 men and women with normolipidemia and hypercholesterolemia who were not taking lipidlowering medicationsin a pooled analysis we used mixed linear models to assess the effects of nut consumption and the potential interactionsresults with a mean daily consumption of 67 g of nuts the following estimated mean reductions were achieved total cholesterol concentration 109 mgdl 51 change lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentration ldlc 102 mgdl 74 change ratio of ldlc to highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentration hdlc 022 83 change and ratio of total cholesterol concentration to hdlc 024 56 change p  001 for all to convert all cholesterol concentrations to millimoles per liter multiply by 00259triglyceride levels were reduced by 206 mgdl 102 in subjects with blood triglyceride levels of at least 150 mgdl p  05 but not in those with lower levels to convert triglyceride level to millimoles per liter multiply by 00113the effects of nut consumption were dose related and different types of nuts had similar effects on blood lipid levelsthe effects of nut consumption were significantly modified by ldlc body mass index and diet type the lipidlowering effects of nut consumption were greatest among subjects with high baseline ldlc and with low body mass index and among those consuming western dietsconclusion nut consumption improves blood lipid levels in a doserelated manner particularly among subjects with higher ldlc or with lower bmi
