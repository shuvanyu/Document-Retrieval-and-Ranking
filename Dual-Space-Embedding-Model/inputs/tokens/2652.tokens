english walnuts have been shown to decrease cardiovascular disease risk however black walnuts do not appear to have not been studied for their cardioprotective effectsthe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of english versus black walnut consumption on blood lipids body weight fattyacid composition of red blood cell rbc membranes and endothelial functionconsumption of 30 g of english walnuts per day for 30 days by 36 human participants improved blood lipids the effects of black walnuts were dependent on the participants sexaddition of either nut to the diet did not result in weight gainthe fattyacid composition of rbc membranes was favorably affected by walnut consumptionrbc polyunsaturated fatty acids increased after consumption of either type of nut however eicosapentaenoic acid increased significantly more after english walnut consumptionendothelial function of 6 unmedicated humans with hypercholesterolemia was maintained after consumption of english walnuts with a meal high in high saturated fats however consumption of black walnuts with the same meal did not maintain endothelial functionoverall these results support the recommendation that consumption of 1 oz of english walnuts per day may decrease cardiovascular risk but more research on black walnut consumption is necessary before an appropriate recommendation can be made
