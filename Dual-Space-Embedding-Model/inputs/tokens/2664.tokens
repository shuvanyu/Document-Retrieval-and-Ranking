preliminary data in the literature indicate that iron absorption from a meal may be increased when consumed with lowph beverages such as cola and it is also possible that sugar iron complexes may alter iron availabilitya randomized crossover trial was conducted to compare the bioavailability of nonheme iron from a vegetarian pizza meal when consumed with 3 different beverages cola diet cola and mineral watersixteen women with serum ferritin concentrations of 1154 Âµgl were recruited and completed the studythe pizza meal contained native iron and added ferric chloride solution as a stable isotope extrinsic label the total iron content of the meal was 53 mg incorporation of iron from the meal into rbc was not affected by the type of drink 99 with cola 94 with diet cola and 96 with waterserum ferritin and plasma hepcidin were correlated r  066 p0001 and both were significant predictors of iron bioavailability but their combined effect explained only 30 of the interindividual variation p0001 and illustrates the current lack of understanding of mechanisms responsible for the finetuning of iron absorptionalthough there was no effect of lowph drinks on iron bioavailability in healthy women their effect on absorption of fortification iron that requires solubilization in dilute acid such as reduced iron and in individuals with low gastric acid production such as older people and individuals with helicobacter pylori infection warrants further investigation
