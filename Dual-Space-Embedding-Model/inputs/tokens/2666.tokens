bioavailability of micronutrients iron and zinc is particularly low from plant foodshence there is a need to evolve a foodbased strategy to improve the same to combat widespread deficiencies of these minerals in a population dependent on plant foodsdietary sulfurcontaining amino acids have been reported to improve the mineral status of experimental animalsour objective was to examine whether sulfur compoundrich allium spices have a similar potential of beneficially modulating the mineral bioavailabilityin this context we examined the influence of exogenously added garlic and onion on the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grainstwo representative cereals and pulses each were studied in both raw and cooked condition employing two levels of garlic 025 and 05 g10 g of grain and onion 15 and 3 g10 g of grainthe enhancing effect of these two spices on iron bioaccessibility was generally evidenced in the case of both the cereals 94659 increase and pulses 99733 increase in both raw and cooked conditionsthe two spices similarly enhanced the bioaccessibility of zinc from the food grains the extent of increase in cereals ranging from 104 to 1594 and in pulses from 98 to 498thus both garlic and onion were evidenced here to have a promoting influence on the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grainsthis novel information has the potential application in evolving a foodbased strategy to improve the bioavailability of trace minerals and hence contributes to the human health benefit
