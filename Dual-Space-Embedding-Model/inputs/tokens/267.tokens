background polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and chlorinated pesticides are endocrine disruptors altering both thyroid and estrogen hormonal systemsless is known of action on androgenic systemsobjective we studied the relationship between serum concentrations of testosterone in relation to levels of pcbs and three chlorinated pesticides in an adult native american mohawk populationmethods we collected fasting serum samples from 703 adult mohawks 257 men and 436 women and analyzed samples for 101 pcb congeners hexachlorobenzene hcb dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde and mirex as well as testosterone cholesterol and triglyceridesthe associations between testosterone and tertiles of serum organochlorine levels both wet weight and lipid adjusted were assessed using a logistic regression model while controlling for age body mass index bmi and other analytes with the lowest tertile being considered the referentmales and females were considered separatelyresults testosterone concentrations in males were inversely correlated with total pcb concentration whether using wetweight or lipidadjusted valuesthe odds ratio or of having a testosterone concentration above the median was 017 95 confidence interval ci 005069 for total wetweight pcbs highest vs lowest tertile after adjustment for age bmi total serum lipids and three pesticidesthe or for lipidadjusted total pcb concentration was 023 95 ci 006078 after adjustment for other analytestestosterone levels were significantly and inversely related to concentrations of pcbs 74 99 153 and 206 but not pcbs 52 105 118 138 170 180 201 or 203testosterone concentrations in females are much lower than in males and not significantly related to serum pcbshcb dde and mirex were not associated with testosterone concentration in either men or womenconclusions elevation in serum pcb levels is associated with a lower concentration of serum testosterone in native american men
