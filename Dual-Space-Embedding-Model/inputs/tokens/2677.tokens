there is growing interest in the potential health benefits of tea including the antimutagenic propertiesfour varieties of white tea which represent the least processed form of tea were shown to have marked antimutagenic activity in the salmonella assay particularly in the presence of s9the most active of these teas exotica china white tea was significantly more effective than premium green tea dragonwell special grade against 2amino3methylimidazo45fquinoline iq and four other heterocyclic amine mutagens namely 2amino38dimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline meiqx 2amino348trimethyl3himidazo45fquinoxaline 48dimeiqx 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip and 3amino1methyl5hpyrido43bindole trpp2mechanism studies were performed using rat liver s9 in assays for methoxyresorufin odemethylase mrod a marker for the enzyme cytochrome p4501a2 that activates heterocyclic amines as well as salmonella assays with the directacting mutagen 2hydroxyamino3methylimidazo45fquinoline nhydroxyiqwhite tea at low concentrations in the assay inhibited mrod activity and attenuated the mutagenic activity of nhydroxyiq in the absence of s9nine of the major constituents found in green tea also were detected in white tea including high levels of epigallocatechin3gallate egcg and several other polyphenolswhen these major constituents were mixed to produce artificial teas according to their relative levels in white and green teas the complete tea exhibited higher antimutagenic potency compared with the corresponding artificial teathe results suggest that the greater inhibitory potency of white versus green tea in the salmonella assay might be related to the relative levels of the nine major constituents perhaps acting synergistically with other minor constituents to inhibit mutagen activation as well as scavenging the reactive intermediates
