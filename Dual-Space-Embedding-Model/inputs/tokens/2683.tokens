background n3 omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas fish and nuts can regulate inflammatory processes and responsesobjective we investigated whether dietary intakes of pufas n3 n6 omega6 and αlinolenic acid fish and nuts were associated with 15y mortality attributed to noncardiovascular noncancer inflammatory diseasesdesign the analyses involved 2514 participants aged 49 y at baselinedietary data were collected by using a semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaire and pufa fish and nut intakes were calculatedinflammatory disease mortality was confirmed from the australian national death indexresults over 15 y 214 subjects died of inflammatory diseaseswomen in the highest tertiles of total n3 pufa intake compared with those in the lowest tertile of intake at baseline had a 44 reduced risk of inflammatory disease mortality p for trend  003this association was not observed in menin both men and women each 1sd increase in energyadjusted intake of αlinolenic acid was inversely associated with inflammatory mortality hazard ratio 083 95 ci 071 098subjects in the second and third tertiles of nut consumption had a 51 and 32 reduced risk of inflammatory disease mortality respectively compared with those in the first tertile referencedietary intakes of longchain n3 and n6 pufas and fish were not associated with inflammatory disease mortalityconclusions we report on a novel link between dietary intake of total n3 pufa and risk of inflammatory disease mortality in older womenfurthermore our data indicate a protective role of nuts but not fish against inflammatory disease mortality
