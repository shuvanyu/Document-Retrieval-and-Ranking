the past decade has seen an explosion in research focusing on innate immunitythrough a wide range of mechanisms including phagocytosis intracellular killing and activation of proinflammatory or antiviral cytokine production via pattern recognition receptors the cells of the innate immune system initiate and support adaptive immunitythe effects of aging on innate immune responses remain incompletely understood particularly in humanshere we review advances in the study of human immunosenescence in the diverse cells of the innate immune system including neutrophils monocytes macrophages nk and nkt cells and dendritic cellswith a focus on consequences for the response to infection or vaccination in old age
