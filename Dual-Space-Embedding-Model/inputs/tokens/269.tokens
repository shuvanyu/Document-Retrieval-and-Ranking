background acrylamide a probable human carcinogen is present in many everyday foodssince the finding of its presence in foods in 2002 epidemiological studies have found some suggestive associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and the risk of various cancersthe aim of this prospective study is to investigate for the first time the association between dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of several histological subtypes of lymphatic malignanciesmethods the netherlands cohort study on diet and cancer includes 120852 men and women followedup since september 1986the number of person years at risk was estimated by using a random sample of participants from the total cohort that was chosen at baseline n   5000acrylamide intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire combined with acrylamide data for dutch foodshazard ratios hrs were calculated for acrylamide intake as a continuous variable as well as in categories quintiles and tertiles for men and women separately and for neversmokers using multivariableadjusted cox proportional hazards modelsresults after 163 years of followup 1233 microscopically confirmed cases of lymphatic malignancies were available for multivariableadjusted analysisfor multiple myeloma and follicular lymphoma hrs for men were 114 95 ci 101 127 and 128 95 ci 103 161 per 10 µg acrylamideday increment respectivelyfor neversmoking men the hr for multiple myeloma was 198 95 ci 138 285no associations were observed for womenconclusion we found indications that acrylamide may increase the risk of multiple myeloma and follicular lymphoma in menthis is the first epidemiological study to investigate the association between dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of lymphatic malignancies and more research into these observed associations is warranted
