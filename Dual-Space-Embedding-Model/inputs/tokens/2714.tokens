domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin that is naturally produced by several diatom species of the genus pseudonitzschiathe toxin acts as a glutamate agonist and is excitotoxic in the vertebrate central nervous system and other glutamate receptorrich organshuman exposure to domoic acid occurs via the consumption of contaminated shellfish that have accumulated the toxin while filter feeding on toxigenic phytoplankton during bloomsthe first reported human domoic acid poisoning event occurred in canada in 1987 during which clinical signs of acute toxicity such as gastrointestinal distress confusion disorientation memory loss coma and death were observedthe illness was named amnesic shellfish poisoning asp and due to effective seafood monitoring programs there have been no documented asp cases since 1987however domoic acid poisoning has a significant effect on marine wildlife and multiple poisoning events have occurred in marine birds and mammals over the last few decadescurrently domoic acid producing diatom blooms are thought to be increasing in frequency world wide posing an increasing threat to wildlife and human healthof particular concern are the potential impacts of longterm lowlevel exposure in at risk human populationsthe impacts of repetitive lowlevel domoic acid exposure are currently unknownthis review provides a basic description of the mechanism of action of domoic acid as well as a synthesis of information pertaining to domoic acid exposure routes toxin susceptibility and the importance of effective monitoring programsthe importance of investigating the potential human health impacts of longterm lowlevel domoic acid exposure in at risk human populations is also discussedpublished by elsevier ltd
