objective we investigated the relation between plasma carotenoids retinol and tocopherol levels and ovarian cancer risk in korean womendesign hospitalbased casecontrol studysetting six tertiary medical institutes in koreapopulation fortyfive epithelial ovarian cancers and 135 agematched controlsmethods preoperative plasma concentrations of betacarotene lycopene zeaxanthin plus lutein retinol alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol were measured by reversephase gradient highpressure liquid chromatographymain outcome measures odds ratios or and 95 confidence intervals 95ci were estimated by tertiles to evaluate the effect of micronutrients on endometrial cancer risk after adjustment for body mass bmi index menopause parity oral contraceptive use smoking status and alcohol consumption statusresults women in the highest tertile for betacarotene had 012times the risk of ovarian cancer of in the lowest tertile or 012 95ci 004036women with the highest tertiles of lycopene or 009 95ci 003032 zeaxanthinlutein or 021 95ci 009052 retinol or 045 95ci 021098 alphatocopherol or 023 95ci 010053 and gammatocopherol or 028 95ci 011070 had lower risk of ovarian cancer than women in the lowest tertilesresults were consistent across strata of socioepidemiologic factorsconclusions micronutrients specifically sscarotene lycopene zeaxanthin lutein retinol alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol may play a role in reducing the risk of ovarian cancer
