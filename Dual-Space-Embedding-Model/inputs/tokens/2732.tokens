samples of mimolette france and milbenkase germany cheeses traditionally ripened by mites were analyzed to determine the mite species present on each samplescientific literature was reviewed to understand which mite species most commonly infest cheesemorphological features possessed by mites were then studied to understand what unique characteristics are required to ensure accurate identificationafter identification and compilation of a detailed key of stored food mites subclass acari order astigmata and their delineating features the mites were viewed through a cryogenic scanning electron microscopeit was determined that mimolette cheese is inoculated with acarus siro l the features studied to identify this mite species included idiosomal length and shape setae length and arrangement leg size placement of anus and genitals and solenidia shapethe milbenkase cheese is inoculated with tyrolichus casei oudemans which was evident after viewing the same features used to identify a siro and the supracoxal seta shapewith this knowledge further research can be conducted on the 2 cheese varieties to understand what chemical physical and microbial changes occur within the cheeses because of mitesit is important to identify the mite species present on each cheese variety to improve our understanding of their role in creating the distinctive characteristics that set these cheeses apart from otherscopyright c 2010 american dairy science associationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
