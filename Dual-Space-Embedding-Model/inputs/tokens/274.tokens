background despite safety reports of the artificial sweetener aspartame healthrelated concerns remainobjective we prospectively evaluated whether the consumption of aspartame and sugarcontaining soda is associated with risk of hematopoetic cancersdesign we repeatedly assessed diet in the nurses health study nhs and health professionals followup study hpfsover 22 y we identified 1324 nonhodgkin lymphomas nhls 285 multiple myelomas and 339 leukemiaswe calculated incidence rrs and 95 cis by using cox proportional hazards modelsresults when the 2 cohorts were combined there was no significant association between soda intake and risks of nhl and multiple myelomahowever in men 1 daily serving of diet soda increased risks of nhl rr 131 95 ci 101 172 and multiple myeloma rr 202 95 ci 120 340 in comparison with men who did not consume diet sodawe observed no increased risks of nhl and multiple myeloma in womenwe also observed an unexpected elevated risk of nhl rr 166 95 ci 110 251 with a higher consumption of regular sugarsweetened soda in men but not in womenin contrast when sexes were analyzed separately with limited power neither regular nor diet soda increased risk of leukemia but were associated with increased leukemia risk when data for men and women were combined rr for consumption of 1 serving of diet sodad when the 2 cohorts were pooled 142 95 ci 100 202conclusion although our findings preserve the possibility of a detrimental effect of a constituent of diet soda such as aspartame on select cancers the inconsistent sex effects and occurrence of an apparent cancer risk in individuals who consume regular soda do not permit the ruling out of chance as an explanation
