aims to determine the blood glucose lowering effect of cinnamon on hba1c blood pressure and lipid profiles in people with type 2 diabetesmethods 58 type 2 diabetic patients 25 males and 33 females aged 549  98 treated only with hypoglycemic agents and with an hba1c more than 7 were randomly assigned to receive either 2g of cinnamon or placebo daily for 12 weeksresults after intervention the mean hba1c was significantly decreased p0005 in the cinnamon group 822 to 786 compared with placebo group 855 to 868mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures sbp and dbp were also significantly reduced p0001 after 12 weeks in the cinnamon group sbp 1326 to 1292 mmhg and dbp 852 to 802 mmhg compared with the placebo group sbp 1345 to 1349 mmhg and dbp 868 to 861 mmhga significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose fpg waist circumference and body mass index bmi was observed at week 12 compared to baseline in the cinnamon group however the changes were not significant when compared to placebo groupthere were no significant differences in serum lipid profiles of total cholesterol triglycerides hdl and ldl cholesterols neither between nor within the groupsconclusions intake of 2g of cinnamon for 12 weeks significantly reduces the hba1c sbp and dbp among poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patientscinnamon supplementation could be considered as an additional dietary supplement option to regulate blood glucose and blood pressure levels along with conventional medications to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus 2010 the authorsdiabetic medicine  2010 diabetes uk
