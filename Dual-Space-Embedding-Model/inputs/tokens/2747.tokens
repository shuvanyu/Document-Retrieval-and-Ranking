watermelon citrullus vulgaris schradis a natural and rich source of the nonessential amino acid citrullinecitrulline is used in the nitric oxide system in humans and has potential antioxidant and vasodilatation rolesa method using gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms was developed to separate citrulline from glutamic acid which coelute when analyzed by high performance liquid chromatographywatermelons were analyzed by gcms to determine the citrulline content among varieties types flesh colors and tissuescitrulline content ranged from 39 to 285 mgg dry weight dwt and was similar between seeded and seedless types 166 and 203 mgg dwt respectivelyred flesh watermelons had slightly less citrulline than the yellow or orange flesh watermelons 74 285 and 142 mgg dwt respectivelyrind contained more citrulline than flesh on a dry weight basis 247 and 167 mgg dwt respectively but a little less on a fresh weight fwt basis 13 and 19 mgg fwt respectivelythese results indicate that watermelon rind an underutilized agricultural waste offers a source of natural citrulline
