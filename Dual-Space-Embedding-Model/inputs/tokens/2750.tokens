objective prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms taaa requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cordrecent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interruptedan anatomical study was undertakenmethods twelve juvenile yorkshire pigs underwent aortic cannulation and infusion of a lowviscosity acrylic resin at physiological pressuresafter curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and using light and electron microscopyresults all vascular structures  8μm in diameter were preservedthoracic and lumbar segmental arteries sas give rise not only to the anterior spinal artery asa but to an extensive paraspinous network feeding the erector spinae iliopsoas and associated musclesthe asa mean diameter 13420 μm is connected at multiple points to repetitive circular epidural arteries with mean diameters of 15026 μmthe capacity of the paraspinous muscular network is 25fold the capacity of the circular epidural arterial network and asa combinedextensive arterial collateralization is apparent between the intraspinal and paraspinous networks and within each networkonly 75 of all sas provide direct asasupplying branchesconclusions the asa is only one component of an extensive paraspinous and intraspinal collateral vascular networkthis network provides an anatomic explanation of the physiological resiliency of spinal cord perfusion when sas are sacrificed during taaa repair
