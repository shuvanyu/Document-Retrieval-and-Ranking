objectives atherosclerosis can obstruct branching arteries of the abdominal aorta including four paired lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery that feed the lumbar spinethe diminished blood flow could result in various back problemsthe aim of this systematic literature review was to assess associations between atherosclerosis and disc degeneration dd or lowback pain lbpdata sources a systematic search of the medlinepubmed database for all original articles on atherosclerosis and ddlbp published until october 2008the search was performed with the medical subject headings atherosclerosis cardiovascular risk factor or vascular disease and keywords disc degeneration disc herniation and back pain on the basis of mesh tree and as a text searchin addition reference lists were studied and searched manuallyobservational studies investigating the association of atherosclerosis or its risk factors and lumbar ddlbp were selectedreview methods the following data were extracted study characteristics duration of followup year of publication findings of atherosclerosiscardiovascular risk factors and ddlbpdisc herniation was regarded as a form of disc degeneration and cardiovascular risk factors were regarded as surrogate for atherosclerosis in epidemiological studiesresults one hundred and seventynine papers were identifiedafter exclusion of case reports letters editorials papers not related to the lumbar spine and animal studies 25 papers were includedpostmortem studies showed an association between atheromatous lesions in the aorta and dd as well as between occluded lumbar arteries and lifetime lbpin clinical studies aortic calcification was associated with lbp and stenosis of lumbar arteries was associated with both dd and lbpin epidemiological studies smoking and high serum cholesterol levels were found to have the most consistent associations with dd and lbpconclusion aortic atherosclerosis and stenosis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine were associated with dd and lbpcardiovascular risk factors had weaker associations being clearly apparent only in cohorts on elderly people or in large study samplesmore prospective clinical studies are needed to further clarify the association of atherosclerosis and lowback disorders
