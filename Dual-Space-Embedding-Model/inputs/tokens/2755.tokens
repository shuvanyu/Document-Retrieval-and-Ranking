campylobacteriosis is the most common antecedent infection leading to the development of inflammatory neuropathies including guillain barr√© syndrome gbs and miller fisher syndrome mfs with alterations in surface proteins and genetic polymorphisms conferring increased riskpoultry is the most common source of c jejuni infection in industrialized countries including the usthere are no data on the prevalence on consumer poultry products of various strains of c jejuni including those hypothesized to be associated with neuropathyto study this c jejuni was isolated from fresh broiler chicken products purchased from grocery stores in the baltimore arealos subtypes and specific genetic polymorphisms were determined by pcr and dna sequencingthe observed relative proportions of los subtypes and genetic polymorphisms in the cstii gene encoding bacterial sialyltransferases involved in los synthesis in c jejuni were characterized and compared to those reported in published studies of patients with gbs mfs and uncomplicated enteritiscommercial poultry products carry a relatively high prevalence of c jejuni strains that have been associated with neuropathic sequelaethe relative proportions of los classes in poultry isolates were similar to those reported in isolates from human enteritis cases and in some instances also similar to isolates from patients diagnosed with neuropathic diseasein terms of cstii polymorphisms there were also similarities between isolates from poultry and those from patients with gbs and mfscopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
