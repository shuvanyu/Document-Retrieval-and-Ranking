background the role of zoonotic biological agents in human cancer occurrence has been little studiedhumans are commonly exposed to viruses that naturally infect and cause cancer in food animals such as poultry that constitute part of the biological environmentit is not known if these viruses cause cancer in humansobjective to study cancer mortality in the largest cohort to date of 20132 workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants a group with the highest human exposures to these virusesmethods mortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the us general population through the estimation of standardized mortality ratiosresults significantly increased risks were observed in the cohort as a whole or in subgroups for several cancer sites viz cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx pancreas tracheabronchuslung brain cervix lymphoid leukemia monocytic leukemia and tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systemselevated smrs that were not statistically significant were observed for cancers of the liver nasopharynx myelofibrosis and myelomanew sites observed to be significantly in excess in this study were cancers of the cervix and penisconclusion this large study provides evidence that a human group with high exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses has increased risk of dying from several cancersother occupational carcinogenic exposures could be of importance in explaining some of the findings such as fumes from wrapping machinesthese findings may have implications for public health amongst persons in the general population who may also be exposed to these viruseswhat is needed now are epidemiologic studies that can demonstrate whether the excess of specific cancers can be attributed to specific occupational exposures while adequately controlling for other potential occupational and nonoccupational carcinogenic exposurescopyright 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
