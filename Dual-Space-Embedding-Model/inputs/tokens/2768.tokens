twentyfour plant lignans were analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry in bran extracts of 16 cereal species in four nut species and in two oilseed species sesame seeds and linseedseighteen of these were lignans previously unidentified in these species and of these 16 were identified in the analyzed samplesfour different extraction methods were applied as follows alkaline extraction mild acid extraction a combination of alkaline and mild acid extraction or accelerated solvent extractionthe extraction method was of great importance for the lignan yield7hydroxymatairesinol which has not previously been detected in cereals because of destructive extraction methods was the dominant lignan in wheat triticale oat barley millet corn bran and amaranth whole grainsyringaresinol was the other dominant cereal lignanwheat and rye bran had the highest lignan content of all cereals however linseeds and sesame seeds were by far the most lignanrich of the studied species
