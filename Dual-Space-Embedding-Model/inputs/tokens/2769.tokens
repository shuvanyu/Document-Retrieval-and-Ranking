enterolignans enterodiol and enterolactone can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseasesenterolignans are formed by the intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignansuntil recently only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors but now several new precursors have been identified of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversionquantitative data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not availablethus the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan precursorsliquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol pinoresinol secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eightythree solid foods and twentysix beverages commonly consumed in the netherlandsthe richest source of lignans was flaxseed 301129 microg100 g which contained mainly secoisolariciresinolalso lignan concentrations in sesame seeds 29331 microg100 g mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol were relatively highfor grain products which are known to be important sources of lignan lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg100 g however many vegetables and fruits had similar concentrations because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinolbrassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans 1852321 microg100 g mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinollignan levels in beverages varied from 0 cola to 91 microg100 ml red wineonly four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinolthus available databases largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods
