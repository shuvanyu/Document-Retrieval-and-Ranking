monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance mgus is a premalignant plasmacell proliferative disorder associated with a lifelong risk of progression to multiple myeloma mmit is not known whether mm is always preceded by a premalignant asymptomatic mgus stageamong 77â€‰469 healthy adults enrolled in the nationwide populationbased prospective prostate lung colorectal and ovarian plco cancer screening trial we identified 71 subjects who developed mm during the course of the study in whom serially collected up to 6 prediagnostic serum samples obtained 2 to 98 years prior to mm diagnosis were availableusing assays for monoclonal mproteins electrophoresisimmunofixation and kappalambda free light chains flcs we determined longitudinally the prevalence of mgus and characterized patterns of monoclonal immunoglobulin abnormalities prior to mm diagnosismgus was present in 1000 8721000 983 9081000 979 8891000 946 818993 1000 8631000 933 681998 and 824 566962 at 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 years prior to mm diagnosis respectivelyin approximately half the study population the mprotein concentration and involved flcratio levels showed a yearly increase prior to mm diagnosisin the present study an asymptomatic mgus stage consistently preceded mmnovel molecular markers are needed to better predict progression to mm in patients with mgus
