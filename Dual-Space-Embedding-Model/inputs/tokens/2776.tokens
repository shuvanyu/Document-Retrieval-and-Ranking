broccoli sprouts are widely consumed in many parts of the worldthere have been no reported concerns with respect to their tolerance and safety in humansa formal phase i study of safety tolerance and pharmacokinetics appeared justified because these sprouts are being used as vehicles for the delivery of the glucosinolate glucoraphanin and its cognate isothiocyanate sulforaphane 1isothiocyanato4rmethylsulfinylbutane in clinical trialssuch trials have been designed to evaluate protective efficacy against development of neoplastic and other diseasesa placebocontrolled doubleblind randomized clinical study of sprout extracts containing either glucosinolates principally glucoraphanin the precursor of sulforaphane or isothiocyanates principally sulforaphane was conducted on healthy volunteers who were inpatients on our clinical research unitthe subjects were studied in three cohorts each comprising three treated individuals and one placebo recipientfollowing a 5day acclimatization period on a cruciferfree diet the broccoli sprout extracts were administered orally at 8h intervals for 7 days 21 doses and the subjects were monitored during this period and for 3 days after the last treatmentdoses were 25 micromol of glucosinolate cohort a 100 micromol of glucosinolate cohort b or 25 micromol of isothiocyanate cohort cthe mean cumulative excretion of dithiocarbamates as a fraction of dose was very similar in cohorts a and b 178  86 and 196  117 of dose respectively and very much higher and more consistent in cohort c 706  20 of dosethirtytwo types of hematology or chemistry tests were done before during and after the treatment periodindicators of liver transaminases and thyroid thyroidstimulating hormone total triiodothyronine t3 and free thyroxine t4 function were examined in detailno significant or consistent subjective or objective abnormal events toxicities associated with any of the sprout extract ingestions were observed
