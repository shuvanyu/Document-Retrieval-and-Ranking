sulforaphane sfr an isothiocyanate from cruciferous vegetables possesses growthinhibiting and apoptosisinducing activities in cancer cell linesrecently sfr has been shown to promote the mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species ros in human cancer cell linesthe present study was undertaken to see whether sfrderived ros might cause dna damage in cultured human cells namely t limphoblastoid jurkat and human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvec13 h treatments with 1030 microm sfr elicited intracellular ros formation as assayed with dihydrorhodamine dhr oxidation as well as dna breakage as assessed with fast halo assay fhathese effects lacked celltype specificity since could be observed in both jurkat and huvecdifferentialph fha analysis of damaged dna showed that sfr causes frank dna single strand breaks ssbs no dna double strand breaks dsbs were found within the considered treatment times up to 3 hsfrderived ros were formed at the mitochondrial respiratory chain mrc level indeed rotenone or myxothiazol mrc complex i and iii inhibitors respectively abrogated ros formationfurthermore ros were not formed in jurkat cells pharmacologically depleted of respiring mitochondria mrcjurkatformation of ros was causally linked to the induction of ssbs indeed all the experimental conditions capable of preventing ros formation also prevented the damage of nuclear dna from sfrintoxicated cellsas to the toxicological relevance of ssbs we found that their prevention slightly but significantly attenuated sfr cytotoxicity suggesting that highdose sfr toxicity is the result of a complex series of events among which gsh depletion seems to play a pivotal rolein conclusion the present study identifies a novel mechanism contributing to sfr toxicity which  since dna damage is a prominent mechanism underlying the cytotoxic activity of established antineoplastic agents  might help to exploit the therapeutic value of sfr in anticancer drug protocolscopyright 2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
