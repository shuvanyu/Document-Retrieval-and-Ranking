background macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif a proinflammatory cytokine with ketoenol tautomerase activity rises rapidly in response to inflammation and is elevated in many chronic diseasesisothiocyanates such as sulforaphane from broccoli are very potent inactivators of mif tautomerase activitya simple rapid method for determining this activity in tissues and body fluids may therefore be valuable for assessing severity of inflammation and efficacy of interventionmethods existing spectrophotometric assays of mif based on conversion of methyl ldopachrome to methyl 56dihydroxyindole2carboxylate and associated loss of absorption at 475 nm lack sensitivityassay sensitivity and efficiency were markedly improved by reducing the nonenzymatic rate by lowering ph to 62 replacing phosphate which catalyzes the reaction with bistris buffer and converting to a microtiter plate formatresults a structurepotency study of mif tautomerase inactivation by isothiocyanates showed that sulforaphane benzyl nhexyl and phenethyl isothiocyanates were especially potentmif tautomerase could be readily quantified in human urine concentrated by ultrafiltrationthis activity comprised i a heatlabile sulforaphaneinactivated macromolecular fraction presumably mif that was concentrated during ultrafiltration ii a flowthrough fraction with constant activity during filtration that was heatstable and insensitive to sulforaphaneadministration of the sulforaphane precursor glucoraphanin to human volunteers almost completely abolished urinary tautomerase activity which was recovered over many hoursconclusions a simple rapid quantitative mif tautomerase assay has been developed as a potential biomarker for assessing inflammatory severity and effectiveness of interventionimpact an improved assay for measuring mif tautomerase activity and its applications are described
