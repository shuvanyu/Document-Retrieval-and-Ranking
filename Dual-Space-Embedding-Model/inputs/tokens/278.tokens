because of the central role of the transcription factor nuclear factorkappab nfkappab in cell survival and proliferation in human multiple myeloma mm we explored the possibility of using it as a target for mm treatment by using curcumin diferuloylmethane an agent known to have very little or no toxicity in humanswe found that nfkappab was constitutively active in all human mm cell lines examined and that curcumin a chemopreventive agent downregulated nfkappab in all cell lines as indicated by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay and prevented the nuclear retention of p65 as shown by immunocytochemistryall mm cell lines showed consitutively active ikappab kinase ikk and ikappabalpha phosphorylationcurcumin suppressed the constitutive ikappabalpha phosphorylation through the inhibition of ikk activitycurcumin also downregulated the expression of nfkappabregulated gene products including ikappabalpha bcl2 bclxl cyclin d1 and interleukin6this led to the suppression of proliferation and arrest of cells at the g1s phase of the cell cyclesuppression of nfkappab complex by ikkgammanfkappab essential modulatorbinding domain peptide also suppressed the proliferation of mm cellscurcumin also activated caspase7 and caspase9 and induced polyadenosine5diphosphateribose polymerase parp cleavagecurcumininduced downregulation of nfkappab a factor that has been implicated in chemoresistance also induced chemosensitivity to vincristine and melphalanoverall our results indicate that curcumin downregulates nfkappab in human mm cells leading to the suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis thus providing the molecular basis for the treatment of mm patients with this pharmacologically safe agent
