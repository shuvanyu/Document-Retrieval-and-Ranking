background the multistep process of carcinogenesis is characterized by progressive disorganization and occurrence of initiation promotion and progression eventsseveral new strategies such as chemoprevention are being developed for treatment and prevention at various stages of carcinogenesissulforaphane a potential chemopreventive agent possesses antiproliferative antiinflammatory antioxidant and anticancer activities and has attracted extensive interest for better cancer managementmethods we evaluated the effect of sulforaphane alone or in combination with gemcitabine on hela cells by cell viability assay and confirmed the results by apoptosis assayfurther we analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the expression of bcl2 cox2 and il1β by rtpcr on hela cellsresults in the present study sulforaphane was found to induce dosedependent selective cytotoxicity in hela cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profileadditionally a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine was found to increase the growth inhibition in a synergistic manner in hela cells compared to the individual drugsalso the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of bcl2 cox2 and il1β upon treatment with sulforaphaneconclusion our results suggest that sulforaphane exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and antiinflammatory properties and provides the first evidence demonstrating synergism between sulforaphane and gemcitabine which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention andor treatment of cervical cancercopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
