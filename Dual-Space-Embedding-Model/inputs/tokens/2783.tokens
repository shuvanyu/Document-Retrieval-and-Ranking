naturallyoccurring chemopreventive agent phenethyl isothiocyanate peitc derived primarily from watercress has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cellsin this study we examined the potential of peitc in enhancing cisplatininduced apoptosis in cervical cancer cellshela cells were exposed to peitc cisplatin or bothpretreatment of cells with peitc strongly enhanced cisplatininduced cytotoxicitypeitc activated the mitogenactivated protein kinases including jnk erk and p38the synergistic induction of apoptosis was significantly attenuated by mek12 inhibitor u0126 but not by jnk or p38 inhibitor suggesting that erk activation is responsible for the synergistic effectwe found that nfÎºb signaling pathway is not involved in the synergistic effectsulforaphane and benzyl isothiocyanate two other members of the isothiocyanate family also sensitize hela cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatinfurthermore we found that the synergistic effect was not seen in normal cellsfinally we demonstrated that noxa induction was associated with apoptosis induced by peitc plus cisplatintaken together this study shows that peitc can sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin and this effect is mediated through erk activation suggesting the potential of peitc to be used as an adjuvant with cisplatin in combination therapeutic treatments
