some indoor activities increase the number concentration of small particles and hence enhance the dose delivered to the lungsthe received particle dose indoors may exceed noticeably the dose from ambient air under routine inhouse activities like cookingin the present work the internal dose by inhalation of ultrafine and fine particles is assessed using an appropriate mechanistic model of lung deposition accommodating aerosol and inhalation dynamicsthe analysis is based on size distribution measurements 10350 nm of indoor and outdoor aerosol number concentrations in a typical residence in athens greecefour different cases are examined namely a cooking event a no activity period indoors and the equivalent time periods outdoorswhen the cooking event frying of baconeggs with a gas fire occurred the amount of deposited particles deep into the lung of an individual indoors exceeded by up to 10 times the amount received by an individual at the same time period outdoorsthe fine particle deposition depends on the level of physical exertion and the hygroscopic properties of the inhaled aerosolthe dose is not found linearly dependant on the indooroutdoor concentrations during the cooking event whereas it is during the no activity periodpractical implications the necessity for determining the dose in specific regions of the human lung as well as the nonlinear relationship between aerosol concentration and internal dose makes the application of dosimetry models importantlung dose of fine and ultrafine particles during a cooking event is compared with the dose at no indoor activity and the dose received under outdoor exposure conditionsthe dose is expressed in terms of number or surface of deposited particlesthis permits to address the dosimetry of very small particles which are released by many indoor sources but represent a slight fraction of the particulate matter massthe enhancement of the internal dose resulting from fine and ultrafine particles generated during the cooking event vs the dose when no indoor source is active is assessedthe results for those cases are also compared with the dose calculated for the measured aerosol outdoors
