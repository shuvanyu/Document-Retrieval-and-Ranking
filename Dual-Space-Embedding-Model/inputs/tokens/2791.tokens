nnitroso compounds were known almost 40 years ago to be present in food treated with sodium nitrite which made fish meal hepatotoxic to animals through formation of nitrosodimethylamine ndmasince that time nnitroso compounds have been shown in animal experiments to be the most broadly acting and the most potent group of carcinogensthe key role of nitrite and nitrogen oxides in forming nnitroso compounds by interaction with secondary and tertiary amino compounds has led to the examination worldwide of foods for the presence of nnitroso compounds which have been found almost exclusively in those foods containing nitrite or which have become exposed to nitrogen oxidesamong these are cured meats especially baconand especially when cooked concentrations of 100 micrograms kg1 have been found or more usually near 10 micrograms kg1this would correspond to consumption of 1 microgram of ndma in a 100g portionmuch higher concentrations of ndma but lower ones of other nitrosamines have been found in japanese smoked and cured fish more than 100 micrograms kg1beer is one source of ndma in which as much as 70 micrograms l1 has been reported in some types of german beer although usual levels are much lower 10 or 5 micrograms l1 this could mean a considerable intake for a heavy beer drinker of several liters per daylevels of nitrosamines have been declining during the past three decades concurrent with a lowering of the nitrite used in food and greater control of exposure of malt to nitrogen oxides in beer makingthere have been declines of nnitroso compound concentrations in many foods during the past two decadesthe small amounts of nitrosamines in food are nonetheless significant because of the possibilityeven likelihoodthat humans are more sensitive to these carcinogens than are laboratory rodentsalthough it is probable that alkylnitrosamides which induce brain tumors in rodents are present in cured meats and other potentially nitrosated products in spite of much searching there has been only limited indirect evidence of their presencecopyright 1999 elsevier science bv
