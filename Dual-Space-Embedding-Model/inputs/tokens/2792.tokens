the effect of dietary components on the levels of nitrosoproline  npro  excreted over a 24 h period in the urine was examined in volunteers ingesting known amounts of various food productsthe ingestion of nitritepreserved meats 85170 g per meal including canned rolled or yunnan ham cured pork luncheon meat and various chinese and europeanstyle sausages led to urinary npro excretion levels ranging from 25 to 785 micrograms24 h whereas the consumption of nonpreserved meat and fish products including chicken herring salmon shrimp ground beef hamburger pork chops and beef liver led to relatively low npro excretion levels ranging from 00 to 08 micrograms24 h the urinary npro levels of 22 vegetarians and 14 lactovegetarians averaged 08 and 14 micrograms24 h respectivelya change from a nitritepreserved meat diet to a vegetarian diet was accompanied by an approximately sixfold reduction in urinary npro levels however these remained above control levels for at least 3 days following the dietary changethe relatively high npro levels following the ingestion of nitritepreserved meats could not be reduced by nitritetrapping chemicals including ascorbic acid ferulic acid caffeic acid or phenoliccontaining mixtures such as coffee and tea which were effective in suppressing endogenous npro formation following the intake of nitrate and prolinethe high urinary npro levels after ingestion of preserved meat products appear to be due to the consumption of preformed npro an understanding of the relative contribution of preformed and endogenously formed nitrosamines appears to be essential when designing dietary intervention programmes
