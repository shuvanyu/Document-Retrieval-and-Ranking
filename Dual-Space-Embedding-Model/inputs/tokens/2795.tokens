microwaveassisted extraction mae and dispersive liquidliquid microextraction dllme coupled with gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms were evaluated for use in the extraction and preconcentration of volatile nitrosamines in meat productsparameters affecting mae such as the extraction solvent used and dllme including the nature and volume of the extracting and disperser solvents extraction time salt addition and centrifugation time were optimizedin the mae method 025g of sample mass was extracted in 10ml naoh 005m in a closedvessel systemfor dllme 15ml of methanol disperser solvent containing 20μl of carbon tetrachloride extraction solvent was rapidly injected by syringe into 5ml of the sample extract solution previously adjusted to ph 6 thereby forming a cloudy solutionphase separation was performed by centrifugation and a volume of 3μl of the sedimented phase was analyzed by gcmsthe enrichment factors provided by dllme varied from 220 to 342 for nnitrosodiethylamine and nnitrosopiperidine respectivelythe matrix effect was evaluated for different samples and it was concluded that sample quantification can be carried out by aqueous calibrationunder the optimized conditions detection limits ranged from 0003 to 0014ngml1 for npip and nmea respectively 012056ngg1 in the meat productscopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
