several studies have suggested an increased risk of lymphoma among workers exposed to meat without conclusive evidencewe conducted a multicenter casecontrol study during 19982004 in the czech republic france germany ireland italy and spain including 2007 cases of nonhodgkin lymphoma 339 cases of hodgkin lymphoma and 2462 controlswe collected detailed information on occupational history and assessed exposure to meat in general and several types of meat via expert assessment of the questionnairesthe odds ratio or of nonhodgkin lymphoma for ever occupational exposure to meat was 118 95 confidence interval ci 095146 that for exposure to beef meat was 122 95 ci 090167 and that for exposure to chicken meat was 119 95 ci 091155the ors were higher among workers with longer duration of exposurean increased risk among workers exposed to beef meat was mainly apparent for diffuse large bcell lymphoma or 149 95ci 096233 chronic lymphocytic leukemia or 135 95 ci 078234 and multiple myeloma or 140 95ci 067294the latter 2 types were also associated with exposure to chicken meat or 155 95 ci 101237 and or 205 95ci 114369follicular lymphoma and tcell lymphoma as well as hodgkin lymphoma did not show any increase in riskoccupational exposure to meat does not appear to represent an important risk factor of lymphoma although an increased risk of specific types of nonhodgkin lymphoma cannot be excludedc 2007 wileyliss inc
