it has been demonstrated that nitrates are reduced to nitrites in humans possibly through bacterial activitynitrites together with ubiquitous amines can lead to an invivo synthesis of carcinogenic nitrosaminesthe average daily intake of nitrates depends upon the amount of vegetables consumed and on the nitrate concentration in drinking wateragricultural practices play an important part in the concentration of nitrate in both water and vegetablesif nitrate is taken up by the plant and not metabolised to amino acids proteins or nucleic acids it is stored in cell vacuoles as a reservehowever with an oversupply of nitrate relative to possible photosynthesis this stored nitrate is still present at harvest and leads to high concentrations in plant tissuethe nitrate content in plants also depends upon other factors such as plant variety cultivar kind and amount of fertiliser time of harvest and environmental factors such as light intensity temperature etcit is suggested that we should try to meet the recommendations of toxicologists who believe a dramatic reduction nitrate intake for humans is necessaryit has been demonstrated that modern biologicalorganic farming methods clearly lead both to lower leaching of nitrates and to lower nitrate content in vegetablessince no synthetic fungicides are used in this farming method problems with the reaction of metabolites of such products and nitrites egto highly cancerogenic and multigenic nitrosoethylenethiourea do not exist
