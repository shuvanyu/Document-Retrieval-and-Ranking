there is marked racial disparity in the incidence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance mgus and multiple myeloma with a two to threefold increased risk in blacks compared with whitesthe increased risk has been seen both in africans and african americanssimilarly an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies in blacks compared with whites has been noted after adjusting for socioeconomic and other risk factors suggesting a genetic predispositionthe higher risk of multiple myeloma in blacks is likely a result of the higher prevalence of the premalignant mgus stage there are no data to suggest that blacks have a higher progression rate of mgus to myelomastudies are emerging that suggest the baseline cytogenetic characteristics and progression may differ by racein contrast to the increased risk noted in blacks studies suggest that the risk may be lower in certain racial and ethnic groups notably persons from japan and mexicowe review the literature on racial disparity in the prevalence pathogenesis and progression of mgus and multiple myeloma between blacks and whiteswe also discuss future directions for research that could inform management of these conditions and positively influence patient outcomes
