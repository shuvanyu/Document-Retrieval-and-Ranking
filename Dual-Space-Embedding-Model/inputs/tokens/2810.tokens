processed meat intake may be involved in the etiology of colorectal cancer a major cause of death in affluent countriesthe epidemiologic studies published to date conclude that the excess risk in the highest category of processed meateaters is comprised between 20 and 50 compared with noneatersin addition the excess risk per gram of intake is clearly higher than that of fresh red meatseveral hypotheses which are mainly based on studies carried out on red meat may explain why processed meat intake is linked to cancer riskthose that have been tested experimentally are i that highfat diets could promote carcinogenesis via insulin resistance or fecal bile acids ii that cooking meat at a high temperature forms carcinogenic heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons iii that carcinogenic nnitroso compounds are formed in meat and endogenously iv that heme iron in red meat can promote carcinogenesis because it increases cell proliferation in the mucosa through lipoperoxidation andor cytotoxicity of fecal waternitrosation might increase the toxicity of heme in cured productssolving this puzzle is a challenge that would permit to reduce cancer load by changing the processes rather than by banning processed meat
