dietary supplementation with beetroot juice br has been shown to reduce resting blood pressure and the o2 cost of submaximal exercise and to increase tolerance to highintensity cyclingwe tested the hypothesis that the physiological effects of br were consequent to its high no3 content per se and not the presence of other potentially bioactive compoundswe investigated changes in blood pressure mitochondrial oxidative capacity qmax and physiological responses to walking and moderate and severeintensity running following dietary supplementation with br and no3depleted br placebo plafter control nonsupplemented tests nine healthy physically active male subjects were assigned in a randomized doubleblind crossover design to receive br 05 lday containing 62 mmol of no3 and pl 05 lday containing 0003 mmol of no3 for 6 dayssubjects completed treadmill exercise tests on days 4 and 5 and kneeextension exercise tests for estimation of qmax using 31pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy on day 6 of the supplementation periodsrelative to pl br elevated plasma no2 concentration 183  119 vs 373  211 nm p  005 and reduced systolic blood pressure 129  9 vs 124  10 mmhg p  001qmax was not different between pl and br 093  005 and 105  022 mms respectivelythe o2 cost of walking 087  012 and 070  010 lmin in pl and br respectively p  001 moderateintensity running 226  027 and 210  028 lmin in pl and br respectively p  001 and severeintensity running endexercise o2 uptake  377  057 and 350  062 lmin in pl and bl respectively p  001 was reduced by br and time to exhaustion during severeintensity running was increased by 15 76  15 and 87  18 min in pl and br respectively p  001in contrast relative to control pl supplementation did not alter plasma no2 concentration blood pressure or the physiological responses to exercisethese results indicate that the positive effects of 6 days of br supplementation on the physiological responses to exercise can be ascribed to the high no3 content per se
