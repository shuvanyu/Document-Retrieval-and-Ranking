purpose dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to reduce the o2 cost of submaximal exercise and to improve highintensity exercise tolerancehowever it is presently unknown whether it may enhance performance during simulated competitionthe present study investigated the effects of acute dietary nitrate supplementation on power output po vo2 and performance during 4 and 161km cycling time trials ttmethods after familiarization nine clublevel competitive male cyclists were assigned in a randomized crossover design to consume 05 l of beetroot juice br containing  62 mmol of nitrate or 05 l of nitratedepleted br placebo pl containing  00047 mmol of nitrate  25 h before the completion of a 4 and a 161km ttresults br supplementation elevated plasma nitrite pl  241  125 vs br  575  199 nm p  005the vo2 values during the tt were not significantly different between the br and pl conditions at any elapsed distance p  005 but br significantly increased mean po during the 4km pl  279  51 vs br  292  44 w p  005 and 161km tt pl  233  43 vs br  247  44 w p  001consequently br improved 4km performance by 28 pl  645  042 vs br  627  035 min p  005 and 161km performance by 27 pl  277  21 vs br  269  18 min p  001conclusions these results suggest that acute dietary nitrate supplementation with 05 l of br improves cycling economy as demonstrated by a higher po for the same vo2 and enhances both 4 and 161km cycling tt performance
