recent studies surprisingly show that dietary inorganic nitrate abundant in vegetables can be metabolized in vivo to form nitrite and then bioactive nitric oxidea reduction in blood pressure was recently noted in healthy volunteers after dietary supplementation with nitrate an effect consistent with formation of vasodilatory nitric oxideoral bacteria have been suggested to play a role in bioactivation of nitrate by first reducing it to the more reactive anion nitritein a crossover designed study in seven healthy volunteers we examined the effects of a commercially available chlorhexidinecontaining antibacterial mouthwash on salivary and plasma levels of nitrite measured after an oral intake of sodium nitrate 10mgkg dissolved in waterin the control situation the salivary and plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite increased greatly after the nitrate loadrinsing the mouth with the antibacterial mouthwash prior to the nitrate load had no effect on nitrate accumulation in saliva or plasma but abolished its conversion to nitrite in saliva and markedly attenuated the rise in plasma nitritewe conclude that the acute increase in plasma nitrite seen after a nitrate load is critically dependent on nitrate reduction in the oral cavity by commensal bacteriathe removal of these bacteria with an antibacterial mouthwash will very likely attenuate the nodependent biological effects of dietary nitrate
