nitrate an inorganic anion abundant in vegetables is converted in vivo to bioactive nitrogen oxides including nowe recently demonstrated that dietary nitrate reduces oxygen cost during physical exercise but the mechanism remains unknownin a doubleblind crossover trial we studied the effects of a dietary intervention with inorganic nitrate on basal mitochondrial function and wholebody oxygen consumption in healthy volunteersskeletal muscle mitochondria harvested after nitrate supplementation displayed an improvement in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency po ratio and a decrease in state 4 respiration with and without atractyloside and respiration without adenylatesthe improved mitochondrial po ratio correlated to the reduction in oxygen cost during exercisemechanistically nitrate reduced the expression of atpadp translocase a protein involved in proton conductancewe conclude that dietary nitrate has profound effects on basal mitochondrial functionthese findings may have implications for exercise physiology and lifestylerelated disorders that involve dysfunctional mitochondriacopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
