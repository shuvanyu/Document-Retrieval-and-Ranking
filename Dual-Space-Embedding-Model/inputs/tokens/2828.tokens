background lowcarbohydrate highanimal protein diets which are advocated for weight loss may not promote the desired reduction in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc concentrationthe effect of exchanging the animal proteins and fats for those of vegetable origin has not been testedour objective was to determine the effect on weight loss and ldlc concentration of a lowcarbohydrate diet high in vegetable proteins from gluten soy nuts fruits vegetables cereals and vegetable oils compared with a highcarbohydrate diet based on lowfat dairy and whole grain productsmethods a total of 47 overweight hyperlipidemic men and women consumed either 1 a lowcarbohydrate 26 of total calories highvegetable protein 31 from gluten soy nuts fruit vegetables and cereals and vegetable oil 43 plantbased diet or 2 a highcarbohydrate lactoovo vegetarian diet 58 carbohydrate 16 protein and 25 fat for 4 weeks each in a parallel study designthe study food was provided at 60 of calorie requirementsresults of the 47 subjects 44 94 test n  22 92 control n  22 96 completed the studyweight loss was similar for both diets approximately 40 kghowever reductions in ldlc concentration and total cholesterolhdlc and apolipoprotein bapolipoprotein ai ratios were greater for the lowcarbohydrate compared with the highcarbohydrate diet 81 p  002 87 p  004 and 96 p  001 respectivelyreductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also seen 19 p  052 and 24 p  02 respectivelyconclusion a lowcarbohydrate plantbased diet has lipidlowering advantages over a highcarbohydrate lowfat weightloss diet in improving heart disease risk factors not seen with conventional lowfat diets with animal products
