scarcelyabsorbed antioxidants might reach the large bowel and exhibit antioxidant activity opposing the action of reactive o species by bacterial and cellular metabolism and thus contributing to protection from oxidative damageinduced gastrointestinal diseasesthis study was carried out to evaluate the antioxidant activity in the faeces of a group of healthy subjects on a freelyselected diet and to look for possible associations with the intake of some macro and micronutrients and food groupsfourteen subjects recorded their food intake three times for a period of 2 d each time collecting all the faeces passed during the next 24 h total antioxidant activity taa mmol 6hydroxy2578 tetramethylchroman2carboxylic acid troloxkg of faecal suspensions was measured using the 22azinobis3ethylbenzothiazoline6sulfonic acid radical cation abts decolorisation assaythe average taa value of faeces was 266 sd 102 mmol troloxkg wet faeces range 75505the total amount of antioxidant equivalents excreted over 24 h derived by multiplying the taa by the amount of faeces passed over 24 h was 324 sd 151 mmol trolox range 092582 and this was significantly correlated with the average 24 h intake of coffee red wine and particularly to the sum of coffee and red wine in conclusion the faeces of healthy subjects show detectable capacity to scavenge radical cations suggesting that antioxidant activity occurs in the colonic lumenmoreover such activity seems at least in part to be related to dietary habits
