background and aims oxidative stress has been advocated as a major cause for cardiovascular disease cvd and low plasma antioxidant concentrations are associated with endothelial dysfunction the first step towards atherosclerosishowever although the antioxidant content in fruits and vegetables may explain at least in part their protective effect against cvd supplementation with antioxidant vitamins fails to improve endothelial function and reduce cvd riskthe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a diet rich in antioxidants on endothelial function measured by flowmediated dilatation fmd in volunteers at low cardiovascular riskmethods and results in a crossover trial 24 subjects 13 women mean age 61  3 years received in a randomised order a 14day high ht and a 14day low lt antioxidant diets with a 2week washout wo in betweenboth diets were comparable in daily portions of fruits and vegetables and in alcohol fibre and macronutrient intake but differed in their total antioxidant capacitybefore and after each diet anthropometrics blood pressure fasting plasma glucose lipid profile hepatic enzymes circulating antioxidant concentrations high sensitivity creactive protein hscrp and fmd were assessedfmd increased significantly during the ht diet compared to the lt p  0000fmd values were 23 higher after ht compared with lt p  0001 after adjustment for age gender and diet orderαtocopherol increased significantly p  005 and hscrp and of γglutamyltranspeptidase decreased significantly p  005 and p  001 respectively during the ht diet compared with the lt dietconclusions a shortterm ht diet improves endothelial function in volunteers at low cardiovascular risk which may further reduce their risk of cvdcopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
