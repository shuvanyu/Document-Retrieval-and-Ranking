both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity oracfl assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe and 22azobis2amidinopropane dihydrochloride as a peroxyl radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods including fruits vegetables nuts dried fruits spices cereals infant and other foodsmost of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different seasons in us marketstotal phenolics of each sample were also measured using the folinciocalteu reagenthydrophilic oracfl values horacfl ranged from 087 to 2641 micromol of trolox equivalents teg among all of the foods whereas lipophilic oracfl values loracfl ranged from 007 to 1611 micromol of teggenerally loracfl values were 10 of the horacfl values except for a very few samplestotal antioxidant capacity was calculated by combining loracfl and horacfldifferences of oracfl values in fruits and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling schemetwo different processing methods cooking and peeling were used on selected foods to evaluate the impact of processing on oracflthe data demonstrated that processing can have significant effects on oracflconsidering all of the foods analyzed the relationship between tp and horacfl showed a very weak correlationtotal hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of teday respectively on the basis of data from the usda continuing survey of food intakes by individuals 19941996
