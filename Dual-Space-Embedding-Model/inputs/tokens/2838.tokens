sangre de grado is an ethnomedicinal red tree sap obtained from croton sppthat is used to treat gastrointestinal ulcers cancer and to promote wound healingto evaluate the potential role of sangre de grado sdg in cancer we examined its effects on human cancer cells ags stomach ht29 and t84 colonviability of cells treated with sdg 10200 microgml decreased p001 in a dose dependent manner measured over a 24h periodcell proliferation at 48 h decreased p001 in all cells treated with sdg 100 microgmlwhen cells in suspension were treated with sdg 100 microgml cell adherence was severely compromised 85cells treated with sdg 100 microgml underwent apoptosis as detected by nucleus condensation and dna fragmentation determined by elisa and flow cytometrymorphological changes as assessed by acridine orangethese effects were similar to that observed with taxol 30 microma significant alteration of microtubular architecture was equally observed in both stomach and colon cancer cells exposed to sdg 100 microgmlthe induction of apoptosis and microtubule damage in ags ht29 and t84 cells suggest that sangre de grado should be evaluated further as a potential source of anticancer agents
