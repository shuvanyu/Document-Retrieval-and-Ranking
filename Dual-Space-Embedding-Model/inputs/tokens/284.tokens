molecular mimicry is a hallmark of the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever where the streptococcal group a carbohydrate epitope nacetyl glucosamine and the ahelical coiledcoil streptococcal m protein structurally mimic cardiac myosin in the human disease rheumatic carditis and in animal models immunized with streptococcal m protein and cardiac myosinrecent studies have unraveled the potential pathogenic mechanisms by which the immune response against the group a streptococcus attacks the rheumatic valve leading to chronic rheumatic heart diseaseboth b and tcell responses are involved in the process and evidence for the hypotheses of molecular mimicry and epitope spreading are reviewed
