the cytotoxic effects of aqueous extract of triphala an ayurvedic formulation were investigated on human breast cancer cell line mcf7 and a transplantable mouse thymic lymphoma barcl95the viability of treated cells was found to decrease with the increasing concentrations of triphalaon the other hand treatment of normal breast epithelial cells mcf10 f human peripheral blood mononuclear cells mouse liver and spleen cells with similar concentrations of triphala did not affect their cytotoxicity significantlythe drug treatment was found to induce apoptosis in mcf7 and barcl95 cells in vitro as determined by annexinv fluorescence and proportion of apoptotic cells was found dependent on triphala concentrationmcf7 cells treated with triphala when subjected to single cell gel electrophoresis revealed a pattern of dna damage characteristic of apoptosisstudies on triphala treated mcf7 and barcl95 cells showed significant increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species ros in a concentration dependent mannerros increase was however found to be insignificant in mcf10 f as well as in murine spleen and liver normal cellsin vivo direct oral feeding of triphala to mice 40 mgkg body weight transplanted with barcl95 produced significant reduction in tumor growth as evaluated by tumor volume measurementit was also found that apoptosis was significantly higher in the excised tumor tissue of triphala fed mice as compared to the control suggesting the involvement of apoptosis in tumor growth reductionthese results suggest that triphala possessed ability to induce cytotoxicity in tumor cells but spared the normal cellsthe differential effect of triphala on normal and tumor cells seems to be related to its ability to evoke differential response in intracellular ros generationthe differential response of normal and tumor cells to triphala in vitro and the substantial regression of transplanted tumor in mice fed with triphala points to its potential use as an anticancer drug for clinical treatment
