this review is an updated and expanded version of two prior reviews that were published in this journal in 1997 and 2003in the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 2512 years from 011981 to 062006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 earliest so far identified to 062006 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwidewe have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a natural product mimic or nm to join the original primary divisionsfrom the data presented the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures but not necessarily the final drug entity is still alive and wellthus in the area of cancer over the time frame from around the 1940s to date of the 155 small molecules 73 are other than s synthetic with 47 actually being either natural products or directly derived therefromin other areas the influence of natural product structures is quite marked with as expected from prior information the antiinfective area being dependent on natural products and their structuresalthough combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have in fact been used in the optimization of many recently approved agents we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 25 plus year time framewe wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugsleads are actually produced by microbes andor microbial interactions with the host from whence it was isolated and therefore we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly
