the acute and subacute toxicity of five biogenic aminestyramine spermidine spermine putrescine and cadaverinewere examined in wistar ratstyramine and cadaverine had a low acute oral toxicity of more than 2000 mgkg body weightputrescine had an acute oral toxicity of 2000 mgkg body weight and spermidine and spermine each of 600 mgkg body weightall amines investigated caused a doserelated decrease in blood pressure after intravenous administration except for tyramine where an increase was foundin 6wk studies the biogenic amines were administered in the diet to groups of 10 male and 10 female ratstyramine and cadaverine were given at levels of 0 200 2000 or 10000 ppm spermine and putrescine at levels of 0 200 2000 or 5000 ppm and spermidine at levels of 0 20 200 or 5001000 ppm in the first study and at levels of 0 or 10000 ppm in a second studyspermine was the most toxicthe high dose level showed a great number of changes such as emaciation aggressiveness convulsions and paralysis of the hind legsgrowth food intake and water intake were considerably decreasedslight anaemia males and changes in plasma clinical chemistry occurredthe relative weights of the thyroid adrenals spleen and heart were increased and that of the liver decreasedimpaired kidney function together with renal histopathological changes and changes in plasma electrolytes and urea occurred with sperminehistopathological examinations also revealed decreased glycogen content in the liver reduction of spermatogenesis severe depletion of splenic white pulp acute involution of the thymus and moderate myocardial degeneration in the heartmyocardial degeneration was also seen in one middose maleadverse effects were also observed in the top dose groups of all other aminesdecreased body weights associated with diminished food intake were generally seenslight increases in packed cell volume haemoglobin concentration and thrombocytes occurred with cadaverinewith spermidine decreased plasma creatinine calcium and inorganic phosphate were observed and decreased potassium levels with cadaverinethe noobservedadverseeffect level was 2000 ppm 180 mgkg body weightday for tyramine cadaverine and putrescine 1000 ppm 83 mgkg body weightday for spermidine and 200 ppm 19 mgkg body weightday for spermine
