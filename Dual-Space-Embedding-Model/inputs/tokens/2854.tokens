biogenic amines produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids have been associated with toxicological symptoms in food productstwentythree samples of traditionally available korean fermented soybean paste samples doenjang were analyzed in order to determine the content of biogenic aminesamines were extracted with 04m perchloric acid and derivatized with dansyl chloridenine biogenic amines were separated from doenjang samples by high performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution acetonitrile and ammonium acetate and detected with spectrophotometric uvvis detection at 254 nmthe ph value of all the samples was ranged from 48 to 60 and the strong amino acid decarboxylase activity was found to be in an acidic environmentthe mean values of biogenic amines tryptamine 2phenylethylamine putrescine cadaverine agmatine histamine tyramine spermidine and spermine determined in 23 doenjang samples were found to be 1837 8203 7084 3424 4732 2679 12666 7441 and 24436 mg respectivelythe findings of this study enhance the safety of not only doenjang but other salted andor fermented food productscopyright c 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
