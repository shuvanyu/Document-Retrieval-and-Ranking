background the risk of indoor exposure to volatile organic compounds vocs on allergic airway diseases in children remains unknownobjective we examined the residential concentrations of vocs emitted from building materials paints furniture and other lifestyle practices and the risks of multiple allergic diseases as well as the igesensitization in preschool age children in swedenmethods in a casecontrol investigation 198 case children with asthma and allergy and 202 healthy controls air samples were collected in the room where the child sleptthe air samples were analyzed for the levels of eight classes of vocsresults a naturallog unit of summed propylene glycol and glycol ethers pges in bedroom air equal to interquartile range or 343  1565 Âµgm3 was associated with 15fold greater likelihood of being a case 95 ci 11  21 15fold greater likelihood of asthma 95 ci 10  23 28fold greater likelihood of rhinitis 95 ci 16  47 and 16fold greater likelihood of eczema 95 ci 11  23 accounting for gender secondhand smoke allergies in both parents wet cleaning with chemical agents construction period of the building limonene cat and dog allergens butyl benzyl phthalate bbzp and di2ethylhexylphthalate dehpwhen the analysis was restricted to the cases the same unit concentration was associated with 18fold greater likelihood of igesensitization 95 ci 11  28 compared to the nonige sensitized casesno similar associations were found for the other classes of vocsconclusion we propose a novel hypothesis that pges in indoor air exacerbate andor induce the multiple allergic symptoms asthma rhinitis and eczema as well as ige sensitization respectively
