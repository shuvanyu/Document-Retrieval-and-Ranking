objectiveshypothesis this study aimed to assess the clinical relevance of contamination of nasal irrigation bottles in patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis crssecondary investigations to identify the presence of bacterial biofilms on the inner surface of the bottles and to assess different sterilization methods were also undertakenstudy design prospective observationalmethods eleven patients with recalcitrant crs who were already using nasal irrigation as part of their treatment regimen were examined every 2 weeks for a period of 6 weeksat each visit a culture sample was taken from their irrigation bottle and middle meatus and they were given a new irrigation bottleirrigation bottles from six patients were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy sem to detect biofilm formationfinally new bottles were inoculated with different strains of staphylococcus aureus and then cleaned with different methodsthe bottles were cultured immediately after cleaning and 48 hours laterresults overall 42 of 43 97 bottles collected demonstrated bacterial growthconcurrent sinonasal and bottle infection with s aureus was seen in 51 of patients during the studybacterial biofilms were demonstrated on the inner surface of four of the six irrigation bottles testedtreatment with miltons solution 1 naocl plus 19 nacl and microwaving were found to be effective methods for sterilizing the bottles both initially after the cleaning and 48 hours laterconclusions patients who irrigate their nose and sinuses commonly contaminate their irrigation bottle most often with s aureus which can be in the biofilm formsimple cleaning methods could reduce contamination of the bottles
