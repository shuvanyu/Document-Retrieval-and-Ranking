the total phenolic content of 13 commercially available fruit juices and juice drinks selected to represent the most popular juice flavors in the united kingdom were analyzed using the folinciocalteu assayindividual phenolic compounds were identified and quantified using hplcpdams2the catechin content and degree of polymerization of proanthocyanidins were also analyzedpurple grape juice contained the largest number of individual phenolic compounds and also the highest concentration of total phenolicsthe main components were flavan3ols anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamates which accounted for 93 of the total phenolic contentin contrast white grape juice which contained principally hydroxycinnamates had the lowest total phenolic contentantioxidant activity was measured using the orac and frap assays and the data obtained were in broad agreement with total phenol contentin view of the recent findings of the kame project indicating that longterm fruit juice consumption can provide protection against alzheimers disease dai et alamj med2006 379 464475 it is suggested that the protective effects may be enhanced by consumption of a combination of juices rich in phenolics and containing a diverse variety of individual phenolic compounds namely juices derived from purple grapes grapefruit cranberries and apples
