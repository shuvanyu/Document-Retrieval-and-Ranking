the effect of an uncooked extreme vegan diet on fecal microflora was studied by direct stool sample gasliquid chromatography glc of bacterial cellular fatty acids and by quantitative bacterial culture by using classical microbiological techniques of isolation identification and enumeration of different bacterial specieseighteen volunteers were divided randomly into two groupsthe test group received an uncooked vegan diet for 1 month and a conventional diet of mixed western type for the other month of the studythe control group consumed a conventional diet throughout the study periodstool samples were collectedbacterial cellular fatty acids were extracted directly from the stool samples and measured by glccomputerized analysis of the resulting fatty acid profiles was performedsuch a profile represents all bacterial cellular fatty acids in a sample and thus reflects its microflora and can be used to detect changes differences or similarities of bacterial flora between individual samples or sample groupsglc profiles changed significantly in the test group after the induction and discontinuation of the vegan diet but not in the control group at any time whereas quantitative bacterial culture did not detect any significant change in fecal bacteriology in either of the groupsthe results suggest that an uncooked extreme vegan diet alters the fecal bacterial flora significantly when it is measured by direct stool sample glc of bacterial fatty acids
