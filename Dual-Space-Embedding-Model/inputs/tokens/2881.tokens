flavanols are the main flavonoids found in cocoa and chocolate and can be especially abundant in certain cocoasresearch over the past decade has identified flavanols as showing diverse beneficial physiologic and antioxidant effects particularly in context of vascular functionthe present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygenation leveldependent bold contrast to explore the effect of flavanols on the human brainmagnetic resonance imaging was used to measure bold responses to a cognitive task in 16 healthy young subjectsthe data presented show an increase in the bold signal intensity in response to a cognitive task following ingestion of flavanolrich cocoa 5 days of 150 mg of cocoa flavanolsthis may arise either as a result of altered neuronal activity or a change in vascular responsiveness or boththe net effect then being dependent on which of the two effects is dominantno significant effects were evident in behavioral reaction times switch cost and heart rate after consumption of this moderate dose of cocoa flavanolsa pilot study evaluated the relationship between cerebral blood flow and a single acute dose 450 mg flavanols of flavanolrich cocoa and showed that flavanolrich cocoa can increase the cerebral blood flow to gray matter suggesting the potential of cocoa flavanols for treatment of vascular impairment including dementia and strokes and thus for maintaining cardiovascular health
