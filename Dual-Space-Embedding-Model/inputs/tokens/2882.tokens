understanding mechanisms associated with flavonoid neuroprotection is complicated by the lack of information on their ability to enter the cnsthis study examined naringenin and quercetin permeability across the bloodbrain barrier bbb using in vitro ecv304c6 coculture and in situ rat modelswe report measurable permeabilities papp for both flavonoids across the in vitro bbb model consistent with their lipophilicityboth flavonoids showed measurable in situ bbb permeabilitythe rates of uptake kin into the right cerebral hemisphere were 0145 and 0019 ml min1 g1 for naringenin and quercetin respectivelyquercetin kin was comparable to that of colchicine 0006 ml min1 g1 a substrate for pglycoprotein pgppreadministration of the pgp inhibitor psc833 or gf120918 10 mgkg body wt significantly increased colchicine kin but only gf120918 able to inhibit breast cancer resistance protein bcrp affected kin for quercetinnaringenin kin was not affectedthe influence of efflux transporters on flavonoid permeability at the bbb was further studied using mdckmdr1 and immortalized rat brain endothelial cells rbe4colchicine quercetin and naringenin all showed measurable accumulation distribution volume vd microlmg protein in both cell typesthe vd for colchicine increased significantly in both cell lines following coincubation with either psc833 25 microm or gf120918 25 micromboth inhibitors also caused an increase in naringenin vd by contrast only gf120918 coincubation significantly increased quercetin vdin conclusion the results demonstrate that flavonoids are able to traverse the bbb in vivohowever the permeability of certain flavonoids in vivo is influenced by their lipophilicity and interactions with efflux transporters
