βamyloid aβ is involved in the formation of senile plaques the typical neuropathological marker for alzheimers disease ad and has been reported to cause apoptosis in neurons via oxidative andor nitrosative stressin this study we have investigated the neuroprotective effect and molecular mechanism of 6gingerol a pungent ingredient of ginger against αβ2535induced oxidative andor nitrosative cell death in shsy5y cells6gingerol pretreatment protected against aβ2535induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death such as dna fragmentation disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential elevated baxbcl2 ratio and activation of caspase3to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism of 6gingerol we have examined aβ2535induced oxidative andor nitrosative stress and cellular antioxidant defense system against them6gingerol effectively suppressed aβ2535induced intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen andor nitrogen species and restored aβ2535depleted endogenous antioxidant glutathione levelsfurthermore 6gingerol treatment upregulated the mrna and protein expression of antioxidant enzymes such as γglutamylcysteine ligase gcl and heme oxygenase1 ho1 the rate limiting enzymes in the glutathione biosynthesis and the degradation of heme respectivelythe expression of aforementioned antioxidant enzymes seemed to be mediated by activation of nfe2related factor 2 nrf2these results suggest that 6gingerol exhibits preventive andor therapeutic potential for the management of ad via augmentation of antioxidant capacitycopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
