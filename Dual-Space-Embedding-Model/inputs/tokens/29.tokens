bloating abdominal distention and flatulence represent very frequent complaints in functional disorders but their pathophysiology and treatment are largely unknownpatients frequently associate these symptoms with excessive intestinal gas and the reduction of gas production may represent an effective strategythe aim was to evaluate the effect of alphagalactosidase administration in a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled protocol on intestinal gas production and gasrelated symptoms after a challenge test meal in healthy volunteerseight healthy volunteers ingested 300 or 1200 galu of alphagalactosidase or placebo during a test meal containing 420 g of cooked beansbreath hydrogen excretion and occurrence of bloating abdominal pain discomfort flatulence and diarrhea were measured for 8 hrthe administration of 1200 galu of alphagalactosidase induced a significant reduction of both breath hydrogen excretion and severity of flatulencea reduction in severity was apparent for all considered symptoms but both 300 and 1200 galu induced a significant reduction in the total symptom scorealphagalactosidase reduced gas production following a meal rich in fermentable carbohydrates and may be helpful in patients with gasrelated symptoms
