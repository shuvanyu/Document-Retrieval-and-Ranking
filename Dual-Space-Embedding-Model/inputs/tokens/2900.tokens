amino acids modulate the secretion of both insulin and glucagon the composition of dietary protein therefore has the potential to influence the balance of glucagon and insulin activitysoy protein as well as many other vegan proteins are higher in nonessential amino acids than most animalderived food proteins and as a result should preferentially favor glucagon productionacting on hepatocytes glucagon promotes and insulin inhibits campdependent mechanisms that downregulate lipogenic enzymes and cholesterol synthesis while upregulating hepatic ldl receptors and production of the igfi antagonist igfbp1the insulinsensitizing properties of many vegan dietshigh in fiber low in saturated fatshould amplify these effects by downregulating insulin secretionadditionally the relatively low essential amino acid content of some vegan diets may decrease hepatic igfi synthesisthus diets featuring vegan proteins can be expected to lower elevated serum lipid levels promote weight loss and decrease circulating igfi activitythe latter effect should impede cancer induction as is seen in animal studies with soy protein lessen neutrophilmediated inflammatory damage and slow growth and maturation in childrenin fact vegans tend to have low serum lipids lean physiques shorter stature later puberty and decreased risk for certain prominent western cancers a vegan diet has documented clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritislowfat vegan diets may be especially protective in regard to cancers linked to insulin resistancenamely breast and colon canceras well as prostate cancer conversely the high igfi activity associated with heavy ingestion of animal products may be largely responsible for the epidemic of western cancers in wealthy societiesincreased phytochemical intake is also likely to contribute to the reduction of cancer risk in vegansregression of coronary stenoses has been documented during lowfat vegan diets coupled with exercise training such regimens also tend to markedly improve diabetic control and lower elevated blood pressurerisk of many other degenerative disorders may be decreased in vegans although reduced growth factor activity may be responsible for an increased risk of hemorrhagic strokeby altering the glucagoninsulin balance it is conceivable that supplemental intakes of key nonessential amino acids could enable omnivores to enjoy some of the health advantages of a vegan dietan unnecessarily high intake of essential amino acidseither in the absolute sense or relative to total dietary proteinmay prove to be as grave a risk factor for western degenerative diseases as is excessive fat intake
