chicken meat with reduced concentration of arachidonic acid aa and reduced ratio between omega6 and omega3 fatty acids has potential health benefits because a reduction in aa intake dampens prostanoid signaling and the proportion between omega6 and omega3 fatty acids is too high in our dietanalyses for fatty acid determination are expensive and finding the optimal number of analyses to give reliable results is a challengethe objective of the present study was i to analyse the intraclass correlation of different fatty acids in five meat samples of one gram each within the same chicken thigh and ii to study individual variations in the concentrations of a range of fatty acids and the ratio between omega6 and omega3 fatty acid concentrations among fifteen chickensfifteen newly hatched broilers were fed a wheatbased diet containing 4 rapeseed oil and 1 linseed oil for three weeksfive muscle samples from the mid location of the thigh of each chicken were analysed for fatty acid compositionthe intraclass correlation sample correlation within the same animal was 085098 for the ratios of total omega6 to total omega3 fatty acids and of aa to eicosapentaenoic acid epathis indicates that when studying these fatty acid ratios one sample of one gram per animal is sufficienthowever due to the high individual variation between chicken for these ratios a relatively high number of animals minimum 15 are required to obtain a sufficiently high power to reveal significant effects of experimental factors egfeeding regimesthe present experiment resulted in meat with a favorable concentration ratio between omega6 and omega3 fatty acidsthe aa concentration varied from 15 to 28 g100 g total fatty acids in thigh muscle in the fifteen broilers and the ratio between aa and epa concentrations ranged from 23 to 39these differences among the birds may be due to genetic variance that can be exploited by breeding for lower aa concentration andor a more favorable aaepa ratio to produce meat with health benefits
