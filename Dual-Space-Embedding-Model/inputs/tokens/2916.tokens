background patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra improve on a vegetarian diet or supplementation with fish oilwe investigated the effects of both dietary measures alone and in combination on inflammation fatty acid composition of erythrocyte lipids eicosanoids and cytokine biosynthesis in patients with ramethods sixtyeight patients with definitive ra were matched into two groups of 34 subjects eachone group was observed for 8 months on a normal western diet wd and the other on an antiinflammatory diet aid providing an arachidonic acid intake of less than 90 mgdaypatients in both groups were allocated to receive placebo or fish oil capsules 30 mgkg body weight for 3 months in a doubleblind crossover study with a 2month washout period between treatmentsclinical examination and routine laboratory findings were evaluated every month and erythrocyte fatty acids eicosanoids and cytokines were evaluated before and after each 3month experimental periodresults sixty patients completed the studyin aid patients but not in wd patients the numbers of tender and swollen joints decreased by 14 during placebo treatmentin aid patients as compared to wd patients fish oil led to a significant reduction in the numbers of tender 28 vs 11 and swollen 34 vs 22 joints p001compared to baseline levels higher enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid in erythrocyte lipids 244 vs 217 and lower formation of leukotriene b4 34 vs 8 p001 11dehydrothromboxane b2 15 vs 10 p005 and prostaglandin metabolites 21 vs 16 p0003 were found in aid patients especially when fish oil was given during months 68 of the experimentconclusion a diet low in arachidonic acid ameliorates clinical signs of inflammation in patients with ra and augments the beneficial effect of fish oil supplementation
