objective since conventional food questionnaires are not precise in assessing the dietary fatty acids the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the salivary fatty acid profile and the alimentary habits of two different groups in an attempt to develop a more reliable way to determine the lipidic intakedesign twenty adults of both sexes with mixed m or vegetarian v diets were studieddata about the fat intake were obtained by means of a food frequency questionnaire ffq and the presence of the main salivary fatty acids was determined by gas chromatographyresults a greater salivary concentration of alphalinolenic acid 183 n3 282 was found in v than in m subjects 165 p  0001 whilst arachidonic acid 204 n6 was lower in v 393 than in m 452 p  0045the same difference regarding arachidonic acid was observed in the dietary fatty acid intake also showing a significant correlation between its dietary and salivary levels in vegetarian subjectsconclusions these results show that salivary arachidonic acid relevant for their eicosanoid production related to the tumourigenesis process and cardiovascular diseases is influenced by dietary fats
