molecular mimicry between streptococci and heart components has been proposed as the triggering factor leading to autoimmunity in rheumatic heart disease rhdin this review we present data from cellular autoimmune responses focusing on the interactions between hla class ii molecules streptococcal peptides and heart tissue proteins and tcell receptor tcr usagehladr7dr53 associated with dq molecules seem to be related with the development of valvular lesions in severe rhd patientsdr7dr53 molecules were also involved in the recognition of an immunodominant m5 peptide in these patientst cells infiltrating rhd hearts displayed several oligoclonal expansionsintralesional tcell clones presenting identical tcrbvbj avaj and cdr3 sequences were able to recognize several antigens with little or low homology showing an intramolecular degenerate pattern of antigen recognitionperipheral blood mononuclear cells of rheumatic fever rf patients produced proinflammatory cytokines and intralesional mononuclear cells from severe rhd patients produced predominantly th1type cytokinesthese results illustrate the complex mechanisms leading to heart tissue damage in rfrhd patientscopyright 2004 s karger ag basel
