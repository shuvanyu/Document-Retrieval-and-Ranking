objective we examined the association between adolescent fiber intake and proliferative bbd a marker of increased breast cancer risk in the nurses health study iimethods among 29480 women who completed a high school diet questionnaire in 1998 682 proliferative bbd cases were identified and confirmed by centralized pathology review between 1991 and 2001multivariateadjusted cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals cisresults women in the highest quintile of adolescent fiber intake had a 25 lower risk of proliferative bbd multivariate hr 95 ci 075 059 096 ptrend  001 than women in the lowest quintilehigh school intake of nuts and apples was also related to significantly reduced bbd riskwomen consuming 2 servings of nutsweek had a 36 lower risk multivariate hr 95 ci 064 048 085 ptrend  001 than women consuming 1 servingmonthresults were essentially the same when the analysis was restricted to prospective cases n  142 diagnosed after return of the high school diet questionnaireconclusions these findings support the hypothesis that dietary intake of fiber and nuts during adolescence influence subsequent risk of breast disease and may suggest a viable means for breast cancer prevention
