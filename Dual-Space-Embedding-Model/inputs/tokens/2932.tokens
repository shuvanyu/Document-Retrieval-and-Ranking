aromatase cytochrome p450 is the only enzyme in vertebrates known to catalyse the biosynthesis of all oestrogens from androgens13aromatase inhibitors therefore constitute a frontline therapy for oestrogendependent breast cancer34in a threestep process each step requiring 1 mol of o2 1 mol of nadph and coupling with its redox partner cytochrome p450 reductase aromatase converts androstenedione testosterone and 16αhydroxytestosterone to oestrone 17βoestradiol and 17β16αoestriol respectively13the first two steps are c19methyl hydroxylation steps and the third involves the aromatization of the steroid aring unique to aromatasewhereas most p450s are not highly substrate selective it is the hallmark androgenic specificity that sets aromatase apartthe structure of this enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane has remained unknown for decades hindering elucidation of the biochemical mechanismhere we present the crystal structure of human placental aromatase the only natural mammalian fulllength p450 and p450 in hormone biosynthetic pathways to be crystallized so farunlike the active sites of many microsomal p450s that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics aromatase has an androgenspecific cleft that binds the androstenedione molecule snuglyhydrophobic and polar residues exquisitely complement the steroid backbonethe locations of catalytically important residues shed light on the reaction mechanismthe relative juxtaposition of the hydrophobic aminoterminal region and the opening to the catalytic cleft shows why membrane anchoring is necessary for the lipophilic substrates to gain access to the active sitethe molecular basis for the enzymes androgenic specificity and unique catalytic mechanism can be used for developing nextgeneration aromatase inhibitors
