aromatase is a cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp19 and is the rate limiting enzyme in the conversion of androgens to estrogenssuppression of in situ estrogen production through aromatase inhibition is the current treatment strategy for hormoneresponsive breast cancersdrugs that inhibit aromatase have been developed and are currently utilized as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in postmenopausal women with hormone dependent breast cancernatural compounds have been studied extensively for important biologic effects such as antioxidant antitumor and antiviral effectsa significant number of studies have also investigated the aromatase inhibitory properties of a variety of plant extracts and phytochemicalsthe identification of natural compounds that inhibit aromatase could be useful both from a chemopreventive standpoint and in the development of new aromatase inhibitory drugsthis review will discuss whole food extracts and the common classes of phytochemicals which have been investigated for potential aromatase inhibitory activitywe will review reported aromatase inhibition kinetic data and possible structural variations that may inhibit or enhance the interaction of phytochemicals with the aromatase enzyme
