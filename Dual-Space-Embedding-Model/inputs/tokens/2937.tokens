correlations between mating system and various aspects of genital anatomy suggest a strong influence of sexual selection on genital morphologywe test the generality of the influence by examining whether primate taxa in which there might be enhanced sexual selection those with multimale mating systems possess as expected relatively more spinous penises than do taxa with other mating systemsas most prosimians but few anthropoids monkeys and apes possess penile spines and because the predominant mating systems of the two taxa differ taxonomic constraints are taken into accountsexual selection apparently does not act on penile spines in the same manner as on other aspects of genital anatomy spinosity is not greatest in multimale taxa of either prosimians or anthropoidsin some taxa spines might stimulate reproductive readiness and synchrony in situations in which the sexes live apart and do not have other means of communicating reproductive state dispersed social systems and stolen extrapair copulations but problems exist with the hypothesis as they do with the idea that spines are involved with scent markingit seems that either penile spines have several functions or penile spinosity in primates and other orders remains to be explained
