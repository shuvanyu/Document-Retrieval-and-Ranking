prenatal phthalate exposure impairs testicular function and shortens anogenital distance agd in male rodentswe present data from the first study to examine agd and other genital measurements in relation to prenatal phthalate exposure in humansa standardized measure of agd was obtained in 134 boys 236 months of ageagd was significantly correlated with penile volume r  027 p  0001 and the proportion of boys with incomplete testicular descent r  020 p  002we defined the anogenital index agi as agd divided by weight at examination agi  agdweight mmkg and calculated the ageadjusted agi by regression analysiswe examined nine phthalate monoester metabolites measured in prenatal urine samples as predictors of ageadjusted agi in regression and categorical analyses that included all participants with prenatal urine samples n  85urinary concentrations of four phthalate metabolites monoethyl phthalate mep mononbutyl phthalate mbp monobenzyl phthalate mbzp and monoisobutyl phthalate mibp were inversely related to agiafter adjusting for age at examination pvalues for regression coefficients ranged from 0007 to 0097comparing boys with prenatal mbp concentration in the highest quartile with those in the lowest quartile the odds ratio for a shorter than expected agi was 102 95 confidence interval 25 to 422the corresponding odds ratios for mep mbzp and mibp were 47 38 and 91 respectively all pvalues  005we defined a summary phthalate score to quantify joint exposure to these four phthalate metabolitesthe ageadjusted agi decreased significantly with increasing phthalate score pvalue for slope  0009the associations between male genital development and phthalate exposure seen here are consistent with the phthalaterelated syndrome of incomplete virilization that has been reported in prenatally exposed rodentsthe median concentrations of phthalate metabolites that are associated with short agi and incomplete testicular descent are below those found in onequarter of the female population of the united states based on a nationwide samplethese data support the hypothesis that prenatal phthalate exposure at environmental levels can adversely affect male reproductive development in humans
