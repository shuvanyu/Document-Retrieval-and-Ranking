the beneficial effect of a 1yr vegetarian diet in ra has recently been demonstrated in a clinical trialwe have analysed stool samples of the 53 ra patients by using direct stool sample gasliquid chromatography of bacterial cellular fatty acidsbased on repeated clinical assessments disease improvement indices were constructed for the patientsat each time point during the intervention period the patients in the diet group were then assigned either to a group with a high improvement index hi or a group with a low improvement index lisignificant alteration in the intestinal flora was observed when the patients changed from omnivorous to vegan dietthere was also a significant difference between the periods with vegan and lactovegetarian dietsthe faecal flora from patients with hi and li differed significantly from each other at 1 and 13 months during the dietthis finding of an association between intestinal flora and disease activity may have implications for our understanding of how diet can affect ra
