context adequate dietary iodine is required for normal thyroid functionthe iodine status and thyroid function of us vegetarians and vegans have not been previously studiedenvironmental perchlorate and thiocyanate inhibitors of thyroid iodine uptake exposures may adversely affect thyroid functionobjective the objective of the study was to assess the iodine status and thyroid function of us vegetarians consume plant based products eggs milk abstain from meat poultry fish shellfish and vegans avoid all animal products and whether these may be affected by environmental perchlorate and thiocyanate exposuresdesign and setting this was a crosssectional assessment of urinary iodine perchlorate and thiocyanate concentrations and serum thyroid function in bostonarea vegetarians and veganssubjects one hundred fortyone subjects 78 vegetarians 63 vegans were recruited one vegan was excludedresults median urinary iodine concentration of vegans 785 μgliter range 689647 μgliter was lower than vegetarians 1470 μgliter range 937786 μgliter p  001adjusted for cigarette smoking confirmed by urinary cotinine levels and thiocyanaterich food consumption median urinary thiocyanate concentration of vegans 630 μgliter range 1083085 μgliter was higher than vegetarians 341 μgliter range 311963 μgliter p  001there were no betweengroup differences in urinary perchlorate concentrations p  075 tsh p  046 and free t4 p  077urinary iodine perchlorate and thiocyanate levels were not associated with tsh p  059 or free t4 p  014 even when adjusted for multiple variablesconclusions us vegetarians are iodine sufficientus vegans may be at risk for low iodine intake and vegan women of childbearing age should supplement with 150 μg iodine dailyenvironmental perchlorate and thiocyanate exposures are not associated with thyroid dysfunction in these groups
