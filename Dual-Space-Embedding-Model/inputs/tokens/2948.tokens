cows with isolation of staphylococcus aureus approximately 1 week after calving and milk yield somatic cell count scc clinical mastitis cm and culling risk through the remaining lactation were assessed in 178 norwegian dairy herdsmixed models with repeated measures were used to compare milk yield and scc and survival analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratio for cm and cullingon average cows with an isolate of staphaureus had a significantly higher scc than culturenegative cowsif no postmilking teat disinfection pmtd was used the mean values of scc were 42000 61000 68000 and 77000 cellsml for cows with no staphaureus isolate with staphaureus isolated in 1 quarter in 2 quarters and more than 2 quarters respectivelyif iodine pmtd was used scc means were 36000 63000 70000 and 122000 respectivelyprimiparous cows testing positive for staphaureus had the same milk yield curve as culturenegative cows except for those with staphaureus isolated in more than 2 quartersthey produced 229 kg less during a 305d lactationmultiparous cows with isolation of staphaureus in at least 1 quarter produced 94161 kg less milk in 2nd and 3rd parity respectively and those with isolation in more than 2 quarters produced 303390 kg less than multiparous culturenegative animals during a 305d lactationcompared with culturenegative cows the hazard ratio for cm and culling in cows with isolation of staphaureus in at least 1 quarter was 20 1624 and 17 1519 respectivelythere was a decrease in the scc and in the cm risk in culturenegative cows where iodine pmtd had been used indicating that iodine pmtd has a preventive effect on already healthy cowsfor cows testing positive for staphaureus in more than 2 quarters at calving iodine pmtd had a negative effect on the cm risk and on the scc through the remaining lactation
