the aim of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the role of hormonal factors in breast cancer risk and to determine whether the effect of reproductive events differs according to age at diagnosisit analysed the effect of age at menarche age at first fullterm pregnancy number of fullterm pregnancies and number of spontaneous abortions both on the overall risk of breast cancer and on its pre or postmenopausal onset using the data on 1718 breast cancer cases obtained from a large sample of around 100â€Š000 french women participating in the e3n cohort studythe results provide further evidence that the overall risk of breast cancer increases with decreasing age at menarche increasing age at first pregnancy and low parityno overall effect of spontaneous abortions was observedthe effect of these reproductive factors differed according to menopausal statusage at menarche had an effect on premenopausal breast cancer risk with a decrease in risk with increasing age of 7 per year p005compared to those who had their first menstrual periods at 11 or before women experiencing menarche at 15 or after had an rr of 066 95 ci 045097 in the premenopausal groupage at first fullterm pregnancy had an effect on both pre and postmenopausal breast cancer risk with significant tests showing increasing risk per year of increasing age p0001 and p005 respectivelya first fullterm pregnancy above age 30 conveyed a risk of 163 95 ci 112238 and 135 95 ci 102178 in the pre and postmenopausal groups respectivelya protective effect of high parity was observed only for postmenopausal breast cancer risk p for trend test 0001 with point estimates of 079 95 ci 060104 069 95 ci 054088 066 95 ci 051085 and 064 95 ci 048086 associated to a one two three and four or more fullterm pregnanciesa history of spontaneous abortion had no significant effect on the risk of breast cancer diagnosed before or after menopauseour results suggest that reproductive events have complex effects on the risk of breast cancerbritish journal of cancer 2002 86 723727doi 101038sjbjc6600124 wwwbjcancercom  2002 cancer research uk
