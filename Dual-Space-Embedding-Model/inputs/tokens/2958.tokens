objectives the objective of this study was to describe the assessment methods and maturation status for a multisite cohort of girls at baseline recruitment and at ages 7 and 8 yearsmethods the method for pubertal maturation staging was developed collaboratively across 3 sitesgirls at ages 6 to 8 years were recruited at 3 sites east harlem new york greater cincinnati metropolitan area and san francisco bay area californiabaseline characteristics were obtained through interviews with caregivers and anthropometric measurements by trained examiners breast stage 2 was defined as onset of pubertal maturationthe Îº statistic was used to evaluate agreement between master trainers and examinerslogistic regression models were used to identify factors that are associated with pubertal maturation and linear regression models to examine factors that are associated with height velocityresults the baseline cohort included 1239 girlsthe proportion of girls who had attained breast stage 2 varied by age raceethnicity bmi percentile and siteat 7 years 104 of white 234 of black nonhispanic and 149 of hispanic girls had attained breast stage 2 at 8 years 183 429 and 309 respectively had attained breast stage 2the prime determinant of height velocity was pubertal statusconclusions in this multisite study there was substantial agreement regarding pubertal staging between examiners across sitesthe proportion of girls who had breast development at ages 7 and 8 years particularly among white girls is greater than that reported from studies of girls who were born 10 to 30 years earlier
