background it has been suggested that phytoestrogens and dietary fiber can affect puberty timingobjective we examined whether intake of isoflavone and fiber in healthy white children before their pubertal growth spurt age at takeoff ato was associated with puberty timingdesign multivariate regression analyses were performed in 227 donald dortmund nutritional and anthropometric longitudinally designed study participants with 3d weighed dietary records and information on potential confounders at baseline 1 and 2 y before atoin a subsample n  111 urinary isoflavones were determined in 24h urine samples by gas chromatographymass spectrometry analysispuberty timing was examined by using ato and chronologic ages at pubertal stage 2 for breast development b2 or gonadal development peak height velocity phv and menarche or voice breakresults girls whose diet was in the highest dietary isoflavone tertile experienced tanner stage 2 for breast development ap 07 y later and reached phv ap 06 y later than did girls whose diet was in the lowest isoflavone tertile age 95 ci at b2 107 y 104 109 y compared with 100 y  97 103 y respectively p for trend  004 age at phv 119 y 116 122 y compared with 113 y 110 116 y respectively p for trend  004 adjusted for body mass index z score and fiber intakein boys dietary isoflavones were not associated with pubertal markersurinary isoflavone and dietary fiber intakes were not associated with pubertal markersconclusions girls but not boys with higher prepubertal isoflavone intakes appear to enter puberty at a later agefiber intake in this sample of healthy white girls and boys was not relevant for puberty timing
