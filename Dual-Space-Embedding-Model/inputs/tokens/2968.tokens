background age and certain lifestyle factors including a higher body mass index and exposure to light at night are related to lower circulating concentrations of melatonina hormone with probable cancerprotective propertiesalthough melatonin is a direct derivative of the essential amino acid tryptophan little is known about the relation of diet with melatonin concentrationsobjective the objective was to examine crosssectional associations of various nutrients and dietary factors as well as food groups with creatinineadjusted first morning urinary melatonin 6sulfatoxymelatonin amt6s concentrationsdesign participants were 998 healthy women from 2 independent cohorts the nurses health study nhs n  585 and nhs ii n  413we computed leastsquares mean hormone concentrations across categories of dietary variables with adjustment for total energy intake age and other nondietary factors known to be associated with amt6s concentrationsresults in multivariate analyses we found no significant associations between the intake of various nutrients including tryptophan and urinary melatonin concentrationsa higher intake of meat particularly red meat was associated with lower concentrations of amt6s adjusted mean concentrations of amt6s across increasing quartiles of red meat intake were 179 170 181 and 153 ngmg creatinine p for trend  002in contrast neither poultry intake including turkey nor fish intake was associated with amt6s concentrationsconclusion although no specific nutrients were associated with altered concentrations of melatonin our findings raise the possibility that several specific foods including red meat could affect cancer risk through the lowering of melatonin concentrations
