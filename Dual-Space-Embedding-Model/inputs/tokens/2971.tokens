objective observational data though sparse and based on small studies with limited ability to control for known breast cancer risk factors support a lower risk of breast cancer in blind women compared to sighted womenmechanisms influenced by ocular light perception such as melatonin or circadian synchronization are thought to account for this lower riskmethods to evaluate whether blind women with no perception of light npl have a lower prevalence of breast cancer compared to blind women with light perception lp we surveyed a cohort of 1392 blind women living in north america 66 breast cancer casesresults in multivariatelogistic regression models controlling for breast cancer risk factors women with npl had a significantly lower prevalence of breast cancer than women with lp odds ratio 043 95 confidence interval 021085we observed little difference in these associations when restricting to postmenopausal women nonshift workers or when excluding women diagnosed with breast cancer within 2 or 4 years of onset of blindnessblind women with npl appear to have a lower risk of breast cancer compared to blind women with lpmore research is needed to elucidate the impact of lp on circadian coordination and melatonin production in the blind and how these factors may relate to breast cancer risk
