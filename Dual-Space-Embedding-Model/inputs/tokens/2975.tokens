females live longer than maleswork from our laboratory has shown that this may be due to the upregulation of longevityassociated genes by estrogensestrogens bind to the estrogen receptors and subsequently activate the mitogen activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa b signalling pathways resulting in an upregulation of antioxidant enzymesestrogen administration however has serious undesirable effects and of course cannot be administered to males because of its powerful feminizing effectsthus we tested the effect of genistein a phytoestrogen of high nutritional importance whose structure is similar to estradiol on the regulation of the expression of antioxidant longevityrelated genes and consequently on oxidant levels in mammary gland tumour cells in culturephytoestrogens mimic the protective effect of oestradiol using the same signalling pathwaythe critical importance of upregulating antioxidant genes by hormonal and dietary manipulations to increase longevity is discussed
