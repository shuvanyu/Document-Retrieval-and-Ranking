epidemiological studies propose that extension of the human lifespan or the reduction of age associated diseases may be achieved by physical exercise caloric restriction and by consumption of certain substances such as resveratrol selenium flavonoids zinc omega 3 unsaturated fatty acids vitamins e and c ginkgobiloba extracts aspirin green tea catechins antioxidants in general and even by light caffeine or alcohol consumptionthough intriguing these studies only show correlative not causative effects between the application of the particular substance and longevityon the other hand obesity is yet a strong menace to the western society and it will emerge even more so throughout the next decades according to the prediction of the whoalthough obesity is considered a severe problem very little is known about the molecular mechanisms causing the associated degeneration of organs and finally deathnutrient related adverse consequences for health and thus ageing may be due to a high sugar or high fat diet excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoke amongst othersin this article we examine the interdependencies of eating and ageing and suggest yeast one of the most successful ageing models as an easy tool to elucidate the molecular pathways from eating to ageingthe conservation of most ageing pathways in yeast and their easy genetic tractability may provide a chance to discriminate between the correlative and causative effects of nutrition on ageing2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
