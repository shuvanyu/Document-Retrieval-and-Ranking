a growing body of evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species ros play an important role in human cancersmanganese superoxide dismutase mnsod is the major antioxidant in the mitochondria catalysing the dismutation of superoxide radicals to form hydrogen peroxidesince the identification of a wellcharacterised functional polymorphism val9ala of mnsod a number of molecular epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between val9ala and cancer riskhowever the results remain conflicting rather than conclusivethis metaanalysis on 15320 cancer cases and 19534 controls from 34 published casecontrol studies shows no significant overall main effect of mnsod val9ala on cancer riskhowever we found that the mnsod 9ala allele was associated with an increased prostate cancer risk valala versus valval odds ratio or11 95 confidence intervals ci 1013 alaala versus valval or13 95 ci 1016 valalaalaala versus valval or12 95 ci 1013in addition we found that the mnsod ala9ala genotype contributed to an increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women who had low consumption of antioxidants alaala versus valalavalval or26 95 ci 1064 with low vitamin c consumption or21 95ci 1334 with low vitamin e consumption and or29 95ci 1557 with low carotenoid consumptionthese results suggest that the mnsod val9ala polymorphism may contribute to cancer development through a disturbed antioxidant balance
