objectives the aim of the study was to evaluate the possible influence of acetic acid administered as vinegar on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses and the potential involvement of a modified gastric emptying rate was studied by use of paracetamol as a markerdesign the white bread reference meal as well as the corresponding meal supplemented with vinegar had the same content of starch protein and fatthe meals were served in the morning after an overnight fast and in random ordercapillary blood samples for analysis of glucose insulin and paracetamol were collected postprandiallysetting the study was performed at the department of applied nutrition and food chemistry lund university swedensubjects ten healthy volunteers seven women and three men aged 2251 y with normal body mass indices were recruitedresults the presence of acetic acid given as vinegar significantly reduced the postprandial glucose gi64 and insulin responses ii65 to a starchy mealas judged from lowered paracetamol levels after the test meal with vinegar the mechanism is probably a delayed gastric emptying rateconclusions fermented foods or food products with added organic acids should preferably be included in the diet in order to reduce glycaemia and insulin demand
