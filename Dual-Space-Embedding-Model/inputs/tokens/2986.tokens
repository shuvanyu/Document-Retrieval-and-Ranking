background inflammation is crucial in all stages of atherosclerosis and few studies have investigated the effect of dietary fat on markers of inflammation related to this disease during the postprandial periodobjective to evaluate the chronic effects of dietary fat on the postprandial expression of proinflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs in healthy subjectsdesign 20 healthy men followed three different diets for 4 weeks each according to a randomized crossover design western diet 15 protein 47 carbohydrates cho 38 fat 22 saturated fatty acid sfa mediterranean diet 15 protein 47 cho 38 fat 24 monounsaturated fatty acid mufa chorich and n3 diet 15 protein 55 cho 30 fat 8 polyunsaturated fatty acid pufaafter 12h fast volunteers were given a breakfast with a fat composition similar to that consumed in each of the dietsbutter breakfast 35 sfa olive oil breakfast 36 mufa walnut breakfast 16 pufa 4 alphalinolenic acid lnaresults the butter breakfast induced a higher increase in tumor necrosis factor tnfalpha messenger rna mrna expression than the olive oil or walnut breakfasts p0014 in pbmcsmoreover we found a higher postprandial response in the mrna of interleukin il6 with the intake of butter and olive oil breakfasts than with the walnut breakfast p0025 in these cellshowever the effects of the three fatty breakfasts on the plasma concentrations of these proinflammatory parameters showed no significant differences pnsconclusion consumption of a butterenriched meal elicits greater postprandial expression of proinflammatory cytokine mrna in pbmcs compared to the olive oil and walnut breakfasts
