licorice is a common chinese medicinal herb with antitumor activitysome components in licorice root have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in cancer cellsthis paper demonstrates for the first time that licorice glycyrrhiza glabra and its component licochalconea la can induce autophagy in addition to apoptosis in human lncap prostate cancer cellsexposure of cells to licorice or la resulted in several confirmed characteristics of autophagy including the appearance of autophagic vacuoles revealed by monodansylcadaverine mdc staining formation of acidic vesicular organelles avos and autophagosome membrane association of microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 lc3 characterized by cleavage of lc3 and its punctuate redistribution as well as ultrastructural observation of autophagic vacuoles by transmission electron microscopyautophagy induction was accompanied by downregulation of bcl2 and inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor pathwayin summary licorice can induce caspasedependent and autophagyrelated cell death in lncap cells
