1studies were carried out on six normal male subjects to determine the shortterm effect of increasing the dietary consumption of animal protein on the urinary risk factors for stoneformation namely volume ph calcium oxalate uric acid and glycosaminoglycans2an increase of 34 gday of animal protein in the diet significantly increased urinary calcium 23 and oxalate 24total urinary nitrogen increased by an average of 368 mmoldaythe accompanying increase in dietary purine 11 mmol of purine nitrogenday caused a 48 increase in the excretion of uric acid3the overall relative probability of forming stones calculated from a combination of the risk factors was markedly increased 250 throughout the period of high animal protein ingestion
