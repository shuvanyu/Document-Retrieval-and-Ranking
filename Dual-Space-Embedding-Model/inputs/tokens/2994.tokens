among the many known health benefits of tea catechins count antiinflammatory and neuroprotective activities as well as effects on the regulation of food intakehere we address cannabimimetic bioactivity of catechin derivatives occurring in tea leaves as a possible cellular effector of these functionalitiescompetitive radioligand binding assays using recombinant human cannabinoid receptors expressed in chem1 and cho cells identified epigallocatechin3ogallate egcg ki336 microm epigallocatechin egc ki357 microm and epicatechin3ogallate ecg ki473 microm as ligands with moderate affinity for type 1 cannabinoid receptors cb1binding to cb2 was weaker with inhibition constants exceeding 50 microm for egc and ecgthe epimers catechin and epicatechin exhibited negligible affinities for both cb1 and cb2it can be concluded that central nervous cannabinoid receptors may be targeted by selected tea catechins but signaling via peripheral type receptors is less likely to play a major role in vivo
