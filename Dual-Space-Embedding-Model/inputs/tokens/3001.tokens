over the last two decades the incidence of obesity and associated metabolic syndrome diseases has risen dramatically becoming a global health crisisincreased caloric intake and decreased physical activity are believed to represent the root causes of this dramatic risehowever recent findings highlight the possible involvement of environmental obesogens xenobiotic chemicals that can disrupt the normal developmental and homeostatic controls over adipogenesis and energy balanceenvironmental estrogens iechemicals with estrogenic potential have been reported to perturb adipogenic mechanisms using in vitro model systems but other classes of endocrinedisrupting chemicals are now coming under scrutiny as wellorganotins represent one class of widespread persistent organic pollutants with potent endocrinedisrupting properties in both invertebrates and vertebratesnew data identify tributyltin chloride and triphenyltin chloride as nanomolar agonist ligands for retinoid x receptor rxr alpha rxr beta and rxr gamma and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma nuclear receptors that play pivotal roles in lipid homeostasis and adipogenesisthe environmental obesogen hypothesis predicts that inappropriate receptor activation by organotins will lead directly to adipocyte differentiation and a predisposition to obesity andor will sensitize exposed individuals to obesity and related metabolic disorders under the influence of the typical highcalorie highfat western dietthe linking of organotin exposure to adipocyte differentiation and obesity opens an important new area of research into potential environmental influences on human health and disease
