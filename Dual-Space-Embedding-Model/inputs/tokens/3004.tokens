background a high intake of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas mainly present in fish may be associated with decreased inflammationprevious intervention studies on fish pufa and inflammatory markers in healthy individuals did not analyze a broad spectrum of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and cell adhesion molecules or their interrelationshipstherefore we determined the effects of fish oil supplementation on 19 serum inflammatory markers and their interrelationships in healthy middleaged individualsmethods individuals n77 aged 5070 years completed a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled intervention studyparticipants received 35 gday fish oil 15 gday total n3 pufa n39 or placebo high oleic sunflower oil n38 for 12 weeksserum concentrations of 19 inflammatory markers were determined using a multiplex immunoassay before and after interventionchanges in concentrations were analyzed using analysis of covariance and differences in patterns in inflammatory markers between the fish oil and placebo group were analyzed by principal component analysisresults fish oil supplementation did not significantly affect serum concentrations of cytokines chemokines or cell adhesion molecules as compared with placebohowever there was a trend for all inflammatory markers to increase after fish oil supplementationpca did not result in markedly distinctive patterns of inflammatory markers for the fish oil and placebo groupconclusion in conclusion this 12week randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled intervention trial did not show that 15 gday n3 pufa significantly affected the serum inflammatory response in healthy individuals nor did patterns of inflammatory markersthus a healthy middleaged population may not benefit from fish oil as an antiinflammatory agent
