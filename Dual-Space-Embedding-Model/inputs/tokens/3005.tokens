background obesity an inflammatory condition linked to cardiovascular disease is associated with expansion of adipose tissuehighly prevalent coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs such as 3344tetrachlorobiphenyl pcb77 accumulate in adipose tissue because of their lipophilicity and increase with obesityhowever the effects of pcbs on adipocytes obesity and obesityassociated cardiovascular disease are unknownobjectives in this study we examined in vitro and in vivo effects of pcb77 on adipocyte differentiation proinflammatory adipokines adipocyte morphology body weight serum lipids and atherosclerosismethods pcb77 or 224455hexachlorobiphenyl pcb153 was incubated with 3t3l1 adipocytes either during differentiation or in mature adipocytesconcentrationdependent effects of pcb77 were contrasted with those of 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin tcddfor in vivo studies we treated c57bl6 wildtype wt or aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr mice with vehicle or pcb77 49 mgkg by intraperitoneal injection and examined body weight gainin separate studies we injected apoe mice with vehicle or pcb77 over a 6week period and examined body weight adipocyte size serum lipids and atherosclerosisresults low concentrations of pcb77 or tcdd increased adipocyte differentiation glycerol3phosphate dehydrogenase activity and expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ whereas higher concentrations inhibited adipocyte differentiationeffects of pcb77 were abolished by the ahr antagonist αnaphthoflavonepcb77 promoted the expression and release of various proinflammatory cytokines from 3t3l1 adipocytesadministration of pcb77 increased body weight gain in wt but not ahr miceapoe mice injected with pcb77 exhibited greater body weight adipocyte hypertrophy serum dyslipidemia and augmented atherosclerosisconclusions our findings suggest that pcb77 may contribute to the development of obesity and obesityassociated atherosclerosis
