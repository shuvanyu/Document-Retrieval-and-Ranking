objectives mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and should be handled with careit can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin and mucous membranesthe most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds such as dimethylmercury and methylmercuryfish have a natural tendency to accumulate mercurymethylmercury is produced by microbial methylation of inorganic mercury in water sediment then it infiltrates the food chain and it consequently accumulates in fishfish are the main source of methylmercury in human foodmercury is transferred into a hair and this can be than used to monitor the longterm exposure to mercurythe content of mercury in hair depends on the frequency of fish consumptionthe aim of our study was to compare mercury content in the hair of children that had various amounts of fish consumption increased or reduceddesign total mercury content in hair was determined by direct method of cold vapors using an ama 245 analyzera total of 174 hair samples from the children 917 years old were analyzedin this study the following localities were compared neratovice n42 jesen√≠ky n44 prague n59 in czech republic and olsztyn in poland n29every sample was accompanied with questionnaire about age gender regions amalgam fillings and fish consumptionresults we did not find a correlation between the content of mercury in hair with age gender or amalgam fillingswe did find a correlation between fish consumption and the amount of mercury found in the hair samplesconclusion the amount of mercury in hair increases with more frequent consumption of freshwater and marine fish
