backgroundobjectives to assess biomarkers and frequency questions as measures of fish consumptionsubjectsmethods participants in the fishermen substudy numbered 125 men and 139 women aged 2274 and in the health 2000 substudy 577 men and 712 women aged 4574 participatedthe aim of the fishermen study was to examine the overall health effect of fish consumption in a highconsumption population whereas the aim of the health 2000 substudy was to obtain indepth information on cardiovascular diseases and diabetesfish consumption was measured by the same validated food frequency questionnaire ffq in both the studies with a further two separate frequency questions used in the fishermen substudydioxins polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and methyl mercury mehg in the fishermen substudy alone and omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids omega3 pufas in both studies were analyzed from fasting serumblood samplesresults the spearmans correlation coefficients between ffq fish consumption and dioxins pcbs mehg and omega3 pufas were respectively 046 048 043 and 038 among the fishermen substudy men and 028 036 045 and 031 among womensimilar correlation coefficients were observed between ffq fish consumption and serum omega3 pufas in the health 2000 substudy and also between ffq fish consumption and the frequency questions on fish consumption in the fishermen substudyaccording to multiple regression modeling and lmg metrics the most important fish consumption biomarkers were dioxins and pcbs among the men and mehg among the womenconclusions environmental contaminants seemed to be slightly better fish consumption biomarkers than omega3 pufas in the baltic sea areathe separate frequency questions measured fish consumption equally well when compared with the ffq
