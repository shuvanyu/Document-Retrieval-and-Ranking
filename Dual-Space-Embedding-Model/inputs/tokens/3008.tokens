objective few biomarkers for dietary intake of various food groups have been establishedthe aim of the present study was to explore whether selenium se iodine mercury hg or arsenic may serve as a biomarker for total fish and seafood intake in addition to the traditionally used n3 fatty acids epa and dhadesign intake of fish and seafood estimated by an ffq was compared with intake assessed by a 4 d weighed food diary and with biomarkers in blood and urinesetting validation study in the norwegian mother and child cohort study mobasubjects one hundred and nineteen womenresults total fishseafood intake median 39 gd calculated with the moba ffq was comparable to intake calculated by the food diary median 30 gd rs  037 p  0001erythrocyte dha and blood hg se and arsenic concentrations were positively correlated with intake of fish and seafood but the association for dha was weakened by the widespread use of supplementsthe main finding was the consistent positive association between the intake of fishseafood and blood arsenic concentrationin multivariate analyses blood arsenic was associated with blood hg and fish and seafood intakein these models arsenic turned out to be the best indicator of intake of fish and seafood both totally and in subgroups of fishseafood intakeconclusions while dha reflected the intake of fatty fish and n3 pufa supplements blood arsenic concentration also reflected the intake of lean fish and seafoodblood arsenic appears to be a useful biomarker for total fish and seafood intake
