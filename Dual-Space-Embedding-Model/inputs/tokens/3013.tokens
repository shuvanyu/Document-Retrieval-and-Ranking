anisakis simplex has been recognized as an important cause of disease in humans and as a foodborne allergen sourceactually this foodborne parasite was recently identified as an emerging food safety riskan a simplex specific primerprobe system based on a realtime polymerase chain reaction pcr detection assay has been successfully optimized and validated with seafood samplesin addition a dna extraction procedure has been optimized to detect the presence of the nematode in food samplesthe assay is a very reliable specific and sensitive methodology to detect the presence of traces of this parasite in seafood products including highly processed samplesas a result 13 sequences of cytochrome c oxidase ii gene were obtained and scrutinized to calculate intra and interspecific variabilities of 0 and 3567 respectivelyfinally an efficiency of 207  014 of the assay was calculated and a limit of detection of 40 ppm parasite in 25 g of sample was also optimizedactually the presence of this parasite in several seafood products has been demonstrated enforcing the necessity of a design for a good manufacturing practice protocol for the processing industry to minimize the presence of this parasite as a foodborne allergen source in seafood products
