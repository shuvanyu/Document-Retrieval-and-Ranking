americans consume about 5 billion hamburgers a yearit is presumed that most hamburgers are composed primarily of meatthe purpose of this study is to assess the content of 8 fast food hamburger brands using histologic methodseight different brands of hamburgers were evaluated for water content by weight and microscopically for recognizable tissue typesglial fibrillary acidic protein gfap staining was used to evaluate for brain tissuewater content by weight ranged from 377 to 624 mean 49meat content in the hamburgers ranged from 21 to 148 median 121the cost per gram of hamburger ranged from 002 to 016 median 003 and did not correlate with meat contentelectron microscopy showed relatively preserved skeletal musclea variety of tissue types besides skeletal muscle were observed including connective tissue n  8 blood vessels n  8 peripheral nerve n  8 adipose tissue n  7 plant material n  4 cartilage n  3 and bone n  2in 2 hamburgers intracellular parasites sarcocystis were identifiedthe gfap immunostaining was not observed in any of the hamburgerslipid content on oilredo staining was graded as 1 moderate in 6 burgers and 2 marked in 2 burgersfast food hamburgers are comprised of little meat median 121approximately half of their weight is made up of waterunexpected tissue types found in some hamburgers included bone cartilage and plant material no brain tissue was presentsarcocystis parasites were discovered in 2 hamburgers
