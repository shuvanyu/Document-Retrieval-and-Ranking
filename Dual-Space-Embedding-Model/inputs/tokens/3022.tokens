the continued increase in incidence of some hormonerelated cancers worldwide is of great concernalthough estrogenlike substances in the environment were blamed for this increase the possible role of endogenous estrogens from food has not been widely discussedwe are particularly concerned about cows milk which contains a considerable quantity of estrogenswhen we name cows milk as one of the important routes of human exposure to estrogens the general response of western people is that man has been drinking cows milk for around 2000 years without apparent harmhowever the milk that we are now consuming is quite different from that consumed 100 years agounlike their pasturefed counterparts of 100 years ago modern dairy cows are usually pregnant and continue to lactate during the latter half of pregnancy when the concentration of estrogens in blood and hence in milk increasesthe correlation of incidence and mortality rates with environmental variables in worldwide countries provides useful clues to the etiology of cancerin this study we correlated incidence rates for breast ovarian and corpus uteri cancers 199397 from cancer incidence in five continents with food intake 196197 from faostat in 40 countriesmeat was most closely correlated with the breast cancer incidence r0827 followed by milk 0817 and cheese 0751stepwise multipleregression analysis smra identified meat as the factor contributing most greatly to the incidence of breast cancer r0862milk was most closely correlated with the incidence of ovarian cancer r0779 followed by animal fats 0717 and cheese 0697smra revealed that milk plus cheese make the greatest contribution to the incidence of ovarian cancer r0767milk was most closely correlated with corpus uteri cancer r0814 followed by cheese 0787smra revealed that milk plus cheese make the most significant contribution to the incidence of corpus uteri cancer r0861in conclusion increased consumption of animalderived food may have adverse effects on the development of hormonedependent cancersamong dietary risk factors we are most concerned with milk and dairy products because the milk we drink today is produced from pregnant cows in which estrogen and progesterone levels are markedly elevated
