background modern genetically improved dairy cows continue to lactate throughout almost the entire pregnancytherefore recent commercial cows milk contains large amounts of estrogens and progesteronewith regard to the exposure of prepubertal children to exogenous estrogens the authors are particularly concerned about commercial milk produced from pregnant cowsthe purpose of the present study was therefore to examine concentrations of serum and urine sex hormones after the intake of cow milkmethods subjects were seven men six prepubertal children and five womenthe men and children drank 600 mlm2 of cow milkurine samples were collected 1 h before the milk intake and four times every hour after intakein men the serum samples were obtained before and 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min after milk intakewomen drank 500 ml of cows milk every night for 21 days beginning on the first day of the second menstruationin three successive menstrual cycles the day of ovulation was examined using an ovulation checkerresults after the intake of cow milk serum estrone e1 and progesterone concentrations significantly increased and serum luteinizing hormone folliclestimulating hormone and testosterone significantly decreased in menurine concentrations of e1 estradiol estriol and pregnanediol significantly increased in all adults and childrenin four out of five women ovulation occurred during the milk intake and the timing of ovulation was similar among the three menstrual cyclesconclusions the present data on men and children indicate that estrogens in milk were absorbed and gonadotropin secretion was suppressed followed by a decrease in testosterone secretionsexual maturation of prepubertal children could be affected by the ordinary intake of cow milk
