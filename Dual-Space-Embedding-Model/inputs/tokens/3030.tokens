the human gut is a lush microbial ecosystem containing about 100 trillion microorganisms whose collective genome the microbiome contains 100fold more genes than the entire human genomethe symbiosis of our extended genome plays a role in host homeostasis and energy extraction from dietin this article we summarize some of the studies that have advanced the understanding of the microbiome and its effects on metabolism obesity and healthmetagenomic studies demonstrated that certain mixes of gut microbiota may protect or predispose the host to obesityfurthermore microbiota transplantation studies in germfree murine models showed that the efficient energy extraction traits of obesetype gut flora are transmissiblethe proposed methods by which the microbiome may contribute to obesity include increasing dietary energy harvest promoting fat deposition and triggering systemic inflammationfuture treatments for obesity may involve modulation of gut microbiota using probiotics or prebiotics
