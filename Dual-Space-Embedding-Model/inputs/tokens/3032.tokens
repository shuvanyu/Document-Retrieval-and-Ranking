the worldwide obesity epidemic is stimulating efforts to identify host and environmental factors that affect energy balancecomparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions the bacteroidetes and the firmicuteshere we demonstrate through metagenomic and biochemical analyses that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiotaour results indicate that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the dietfurthermore this trait is transmissible colonization of germfree mice with an obese microbiota results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a lean microbiotathese results identify the gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity
