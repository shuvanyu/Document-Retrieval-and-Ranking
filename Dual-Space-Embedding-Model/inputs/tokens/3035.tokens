the aetiology of obesity is multifactorialan understanding of the contributions of various causal factors is essential for the proper management of obesityalthough it is primarily thought of as a condition brought on by lifestyle choices recent evidence shows there is a link between obesity and viral infectionsnumerous animal models have documented an increased body weight and a number of physiologic changes including increased insulin sensitivity increased glucose uptake and decreased leptin secretion that contribute to an increase in body fat in adenovirus36 infectionother viral agents associated with increasing obesity in animals included canine distemper virus rousassociated virus 7 scrapie borna disease virus smam1 and other adenovirusesthis review attempted to determine if viral infection is a possible cause of obesityalso this paper discussed mechanisms by which viruses might produce obesitybased on the evidence presented in this paper it can be concluded that a link between obesity and viral infections cannot be ruled outfurther epidemiologic studies are needed to establish a causal link between the two and determine if these results can be used in future management and prevention of obesity
