excessive fat accumulation has been observed in the field in chickens infected with adenovirusin the present study this has been verified under experimental conditionschickens inoculated with adenovirus showed lesser weight gain but excessive adiposity compared to normal control chickensthese changes could not be explained by variation in food consumptionchickens acquiring adenovirus naturally from the inoculated group showed similar adiposityserum cholesterol and triglyceride levels of inoculated and naturally infected chickens were significantly lower compared to those of the control groupsuch an association between adenovirus infection and adiposity has been shown probably for the first time which might help in further understanding of the complex problem of obesity
