1 irondeficiency anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of low birth weight and preterm birth 2 in a randomised doubleblind placebocontrolled trial iron supplementation in pregnant women with haemoglobin levels of at least 132 g100 ml at the beginning of the 2nd trimester was associated with low birth weight and maternal hypertension 3 in a trial in women with haemoglobin levels of at least 115 g100 ml who took supplemental iron haemoglobin levels above 145 g100 ml at 28 weeks of gestation were associated with an 8fold increase in the risk of preterm birth and a 6fold increase in the risk of low birth weight 4 an epidemiological study showed a link between high maternal haemoglobin levels and low birth weight 5 in practice iron supplements should not be taken by pregnant women whose haemoglobin levels exceed 11 g100 ml during the 1st and 3rd trimesters and 105 g100 ml during the 2nd trimester
