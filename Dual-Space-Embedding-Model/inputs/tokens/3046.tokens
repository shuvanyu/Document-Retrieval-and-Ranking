the methanolic extract of fresh tea leaves of camellia sinensis l theaceae cs was assayed for its potential to inhibit enzymes with hydrolytic activity in naja naja kaouthia lesson elapidae and calloselasma rhodostoma kuhl viperidae venomsthese snake venom enzymes are responsible for the early effects of envenomation such as local tissue damage and inflammationthe cs extract inhibited phospholipase a2 proteases hyaluronidase and lamino acid oxidase in both venoms by in vitro neutralization and inhibited the hemorrhagic and the dermonecrotic activities of the venoms in vivoit is suggested that the inhibitory potential of the cs extract against local tissue damage induced by snake venoms may be attributed to complexation and chelation between the venom proteins and the phenolic contents of the extract
