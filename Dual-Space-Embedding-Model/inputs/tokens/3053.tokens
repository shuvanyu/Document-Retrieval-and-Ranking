background despite strong evidence of an inverse association of physical activity with postmenopausal breast cancer risk whether a certain intensity or time of life of physical activity is most effective for lowering breast cancer risk is not knownmethods in 118899 postmenopausal women in the prospective nihaarp diet and health study we examined the relations of light and moderatetovigorous intensity physical activity during four periods of life historical ages 1518 1929 3539 years recent past 10 years to postmenopausal breast cancer riskphysical activity was assessed by selfreport at baseline and 4287 incident breast cancers were identified over 66 years of followupresults in ageadjusted and multivariate cox regression models 7 hoursweek of moderatetovigorous activity during the past 10 years was associated with 16 reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer rr084 95ci076093 compared with inactivitythe association remained statistically significant after adjustment for bmi rr087 95ci078096neither moderatetovigorous activity during other periods of life nor light intensity activity during any period of life was related to breast cancer risk and associations did not vary by tumor characteristicsconclusion a high level of recent but not historical physical activity of moderatetovigorous intensity is associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer riskmore precise recall of recent physical activity than activity in the distant past is one possible explanation for our findings
