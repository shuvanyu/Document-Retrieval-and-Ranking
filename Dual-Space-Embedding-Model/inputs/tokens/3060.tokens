clostridium difficile is a critically important cause of disease in humans particularly in hospitalized individualsthree major factors have raised concern about the potential for this pathogen to be a cause of foodborne disease the increasing recognition of communityassociated c difficile infection recent studies identifying c difficile in food animals and food and similarities in c difficile isolates from animals food and humansit is clear that c difficile can be commonly found in food animals and food in many regions and that strains important in human infections such as ribotype 027nap1toxinotype iii and ribotype 078toxinotype v are often presenthowever it is currently unclear whether ingestion of contaminated food can result in colonization or infectionmany questions remain unanswered regarding the role of c difficile in communityassociated diarrhoea its source when it is a food contaminant the infective dose and the association between ingestion of contaminated food and diseasethe significant role of this pathogen in human disease and its potential emergence as an important communityassociated pathogen indicate that careful evaluation of different sources of exposure including food is required but determination of the potential role of food in c difficile infection may be difficult
