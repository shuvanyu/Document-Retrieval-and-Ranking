the current paper provides an analysis of the potential number of cancer cases that might be prevented if half the us population increased its fruit and vegetable consumption by one serving each per daythis number is contrasted with an upperbound estimate of concomitant cancer cases that might be theoretically attributed to the intake of pesticide residues arising from the same additional fruit and vegetable consumptionthe cancer prevention estimates were derived using a published metaanalysis of nutritional epidemiology studiesthe cancer risks were estimated using us environmental protection agency epa methods cancer potency estimates from rodent bioassays and pesticide residue sampling data from the us department of agriculture usdathe resulting estimates are that approximately 20000 cancer cases per year could be prevented by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption while up to 10 cancer cases per year could be caused by the added pesticide consumptionthese estimates have significant uncertainties eg potential residual confounding in the fruit and vegetable epidemiologic studies and reliance on rodent bioassays for cancer riskhowever the overwhelming difference between benefit and risk estimates provides confidence that consumers should not be concerned about cancer risks from consuming conventionallygrown fruits and vegetablescopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
