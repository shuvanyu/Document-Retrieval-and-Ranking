to determine the presence of shiga toxinproducing escherichia coli stec and other potentially diarrheagenic e coli strains in retail meats 7258 e coli isolates collected by the us national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system narms retail meat program from 2002 to 2007 were screened for shiga toxin genesin addition 1275 of the e coli isolates recovered in 2006 were examined for virulence genes specific for other diarrheagenic e coli strainsseventeen isolates 16 from ground beef and 1 from a pork chop were positive for stx genes including 5 positive for both stx1 and stx2 2 positive for stx1 and 10 positive for stx2the 17 stec strains belonged to 10 serotypes o83h8 o8h16 o15h16 o15h17 o88h38 onth51 onth2 onth10 onth7 and onth46none of the stec isolates contained eae whereas seven carried enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec hlyaall except one stec isolate exhibited toxic effects on vero cellsdna sequence analysis showed that the stx2 genes from five stec isolates encoded mucusactivatable stx2dsubtyping of the 17 stec isolates by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis pfge yielded 14 distinct restriction patternsamong the 1275 isolates from 2006 11 atypical enteropathogenic e coli epec isolates were identified in addition to 3 stec isolatesthis study demonstrated that retail meats mainly ground beef were contaminated with diverse stec strainsthe presence of atypical epec strains in retail meat is also of concern due to their potential to cause human infections
