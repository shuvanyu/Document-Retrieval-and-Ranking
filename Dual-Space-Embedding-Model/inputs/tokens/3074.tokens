bowel function was assessed in 51 subjects 10 women and seven men who habitually consumed an omnivorous vegetarian or vegan dietthe subjects on these diets had a mean intake of fibre of 23 g 37 g and 47 g respectivelymean transit times were variable and not significantly different between the groupsvegans however had a greater frequency of defecation and passed softer stoolsall measurements of bowel function were significantly correlated with total dietary fibreas dietary fibre increased mean transit time decreased stool frequency increased and the stools became softermen produced a greater quantity of softer less formed faeces than womenduring the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle women excreted harder stools and had a significantly longer mean transit timethe finding that mean transit time was more highly correlated with faecal form than any of the other bowel function measurements could be of practical importance
