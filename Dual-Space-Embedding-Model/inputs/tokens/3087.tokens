background previous research relating dietary fat a modifiable risk factor to pancreatic cancer has been inconclusivemethods we prospectively analyzed the association between intakes of fat fat subtypes and fat food sources and exocrine pancreatic cancer in the national institutes of healthaarp diet and health study a us cohort of 308 736 men and 216 737 women who completed a 124item food frequency questionnaire in 19951996hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated using cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for energy intake smoking history body mass index and diabetesstatistical tests were twosidedresults over an average followup of 63 years 865 men and 472 women were diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer 450 and 345 cases per 100 000 personyears respectivelyafter multivariable adjustment and combination of data for men and women pancreatic cancer risk was directly related to the intakes of total fat highest vs lowest quintile 468 vs 332 cases per 100 000 personyears hr  123 95 ci  103 to 146 ptrend   03 saturated fat 515 vs 331 cases per 100 000 personyears hr  136 95 ci  114 to 162 ptrend  001 and monounsaturated fat 462 vs 329 cases per 100 000 personyears hr  122 95 ci  102 to 146 ptrend  05 but not polyunsaturated fatthe associations were strongest for saturated fat from animal food sources 520 vs 322 cases per 100 000 personyears hr  143 95 ci  120 to 170 ptrend  001 specifically intakes from red meat and dairy products were both statistically significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk hr  127 and 119 respectivelyconclusion in this large prospective cohort with a wide range of intakes dietary fat of animal origin was associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk
