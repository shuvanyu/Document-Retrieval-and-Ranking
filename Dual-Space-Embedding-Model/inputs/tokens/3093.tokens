background statin therapy can cause myopathy however it is unclear whether this exacerbates agerelated muscle function declinesaim to describe differences between statin users and nonusers in muscle mass muscle function and falls risk in a group of communitydwelling older adultsdesign a prospective populationbased cohort study with a mean followup of 26 yearsmethods total 774 older adults 48 female mean standard deviation age  62 7 years were examined at baseline and followupdifferences in percentage appendicular lean mass alm leg strength leg muscle quality lmq specific force and falls risk were compared for statin users and nonusersresults there were 147 19 statin users at baseline and 179 23 at followuplongitudinal analyses revealed statin use at baseline predicted increased falls risk scores over 26 years 014 95 ci 001 to 027 and a trend towards increased alm 045 95 ci 001 to 092statin users at both time points demonstrated decreased leg strength 502 kg 95 ci 965 to 040 and lmq 030 kgkg 95 ci 059 to 001 and trended towards increased falls risk 013 95 ci 001 to 026 compared to controlsfinally statin users at both baseline and followup demonstrated decreased leg strength 1617 kg 95 ci 3019 to 215 and lmq 113 kgkg 95 ci 202 to 024 compared to those who had ceased statin use at followupconclusion statin use may exacerbate muscle performance declines and falls risk associated with aging without a concomitant decrease in muscle mass and this effect may be reversible with cessation
