we encountered a 62yearold woman with a progressively worsening sore throat and a sharp lump located in her left upper neck which appeared several hours before admissionafter questioning she underwent rigid esophagoscopy at a local hospital for suspected fish bone impaction but this gave a negative resultunusual signs caused us to arrange a computed tomography scan which showed that a foreign body had penetrated the left sternocleidomastoid muscle to the subcutaneous layer with extensive emphysema in the neckwe extracted the foreign body with a 1cm horizontal incision of the neck under general anesthesiathe patient returned to a normal diet and was discharged on day 5 of hospitalization without further morbiditythis is another rare case of a migrating foreign body presenting as a neck lumpon reviewing the literature most cases involving subcutaneously migrating fish bones show development of a neck lump several weeks to months after ingestion with relatively stable conditionshowever our case showed a neck lump 1 day after ingestion with acute toxic symptoms
