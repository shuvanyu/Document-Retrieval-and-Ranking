rheumatoid arthritis ra is characterized by inflammation of the synovial tissues in the jointsa number of papers related to dietary components that are associated with this inflammation are reviewedin addition the ecological approach is used to study the links between diet and ramulticountry data for prevalence of ra for females from eight and fifteen countries were compared statistically with components of national dietary supplyfat from meat and offal for the period 2 years before the prevalence data was found to have the highest statistical association with the prevalence of ra r2 0877 p0001 for eight countriesthe statistical correlations for meat and offal were almost as high as those for their fatsimilar correlations were found for temporal changes in indices of effects of ra in several european countries between 1968 and 1978 as more meat was added to the national diets although the correlations were higher for meat than for fatit is hypothesized that meat and offal may be a major factor contributing to the inflammation in rain the present short review the author examines some of the data that associate meat consumption with ra and the possible factors egfat fe and nitrite which may contribute to the inflammation
