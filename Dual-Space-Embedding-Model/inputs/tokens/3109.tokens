the effects of a strict uncooked vegan diet on serum lipid and sterol concentrations were studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritisthe subjects were randomized into a vegan diet group n 16 who consumed a vegan diet for 23 months or into a control group n 13 who continued their usual omnivorous dietsserum total and ldlcholesterol and phospholipid concentrations were significantly decreased by the vegan dietthe levels of serum cholestanol and lathosterol also decreased but serum cholestanoltotal cholesterol and lathosteroltotal cholesterol did not changethe effect of a vegan diet on serum plant sterols was divergent as the concentration of campesterol decreased while that of sitosterol increasedthis effect resulted in a significantly greater sitosterolcampesterol value in the vegan diet group than in the control group 148 sd 039 v 072 sd 014 p  0001a higher concentration of campesterol compared with sitosterol is normal in omnivorous subjects and can be explained by lower absorption and esterification rates of sitosterolour results suggest that a strict uncooked vegan diet changes the relative absorption rates of these sterols andor their biliary clearance
