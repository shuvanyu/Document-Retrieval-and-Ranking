in a controlled clinical trial we have recently shown that patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra improved after fasting for 710 d and that the improvement could be sustained through 35 months with a vegan diet and 9 months with a lactovegetarian dietother studies have indicated that the inflammatory process in ra can be reduced through manipulation of dietary fatty acidsa switch to a vegetarian diet significantly alters the intake of fatty acidstherefore we have analysed the changes in fatty acid profiles of the plasma phospholipid fraction and related these changes to disease activitythe concentrations of the fatty acids 203n6 and 204n6 were significantly reduced after 35 months with a vegan diet p  00001 and p  001 respectively but the concentration increased to baseline values with a lactovegetarian dietthe concentration of 205n3 was significantly reduced after the vegan diet p  00001 and the lactovegetarian diet periods p  001there was no significant difference in fatty acid concentrations between diet responders and diet nonresponders after the vegan or lactovegetarian diet periodsour results indicate that the changes in the fatty acid profiles cannot explain the clinical improvement
