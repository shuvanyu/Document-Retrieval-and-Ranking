benzene was previously detected as a heatinduced contaminant in infant carrot juicesthis study shows that carrot juice contains substances such as betacarotene phenylalanine or terpenes that may act as precursors for benzene formation during food processingas benzene exposure has been associated with childhood leukaemia and other cancers this study aimed to provide a quantitative risk assessmentto accomplish this we used measured food consumption data from the dortmund nutritional and anthropometric longitudinally designed donald study along with survey data on benzene in different juice categoriesthe calculated exposures for infants between 3 and 12 months were low with averages between 1 and 10 ngkg bwday resulting in a margin of exposure above 100000the exposures were judged as unlikely to pose a health risk for infantsnevertheless carcinogenic contaminants should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably achievablethe focus should be set on improving the sterilization conditionscopyright 2009 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
