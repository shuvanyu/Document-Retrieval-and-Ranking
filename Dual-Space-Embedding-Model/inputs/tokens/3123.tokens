the prevalence of dementia is increasing with expansion of the older adult populationin the absence of effective therapy preventive approaches are essential to address this public health problemblueberries contain polyphenolic compounds most prominently anthocyanins which have antioxidant and antiinflammatory effectsin addition anthocyanins have been associated with increased neuronal signaling in brain centers mediating memory function as well as improved glucose disposal benefits that would be expected to mitigate neurodegenerationwe investigated the effects of daily consumption of wild blueberry juice in a sample of nine older adults with early memory changesat 12 weeks we observed improved paired associate learning p  0009 and word list recall p  004in addition there were trends suggesting reduced depressive symptoms p  008 and lower glucose levels p  010we also compared the memory performances of the blueberry subjects with a demographicallymatched sample who consumed a berry placebo beverage in a companion trial of identical design and observed comparable results for paired associate learningthe findings of this preliminary study suggest that moderateterm blueberry supplementation can confer neurocognitive benefit and establish a basis for more comprehensive human trials to study preventive potential and neuronal mechanisms
