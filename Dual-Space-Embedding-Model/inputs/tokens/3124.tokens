background it is widely believed that cancer can be prevented by high intake of fruits and vegetableshowever inconsistent results from many studies have not been able to conclusively establish an inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and overall cancer riskmethods we conducted a prospective analysis of the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic cohort to assess relationships between intake of total fruits total vegetables and total fruits and vegetables combined and cancer risk during 19922000detailed information on the dietary habit and lifestyle variables of the cohort was obtainedcancer incidence and mortality data were ascertained and hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals cis were estimated using multivariable cox regression modelsanalyses were also conducted for cancers associated with tobacco and alcohol after stratification for tobacco smoking and alcohol drinkingresults of the initial 142 605 men and 335 873 women included in the study 9604 men and 21 000 women were identified with cancer after a median followup of 87 yearsthe crude cancer incidence rates were 79 per 1000 personyears in men and 71 per 1000 personyears in womenassociations between reduced cancer risk and increased intake of total fruits and vegetables combined and total vegetables for the entire cohort were similar 200 gd increased intake of fruits and vegetables combined hr  097 95 ci  096 to 099 100 gd increased intake of total vegetables hr  098 95 ci  097 to 099 intake of fruits showed a weaker inverse association 100 gd increased intake of total fruits hr  099 95 ci  098 to 100the reduced risk of cancer associated with high vegetable intake was restricted to women hr  098 95 ci  097 to 099stratification by alcohol intake suggested a stronger reduction in risk in heavy drinkers and was confined to cancers caused by smoking and alcoholconclusions a very small inverse association between intake of total fruits and vegetables and cancer risk was observed in this studygiven the small magnitude of the observed associations caution should be applied in their interpretation
