lipid oxidation especially the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is a significant issue in the food industry impacting both food quality and health of consumersapple skin was investigated as a source of natural antioxidantsthe phenolic compound composition and antioxidant properties of 21 selected apple genotypes were evaluatedthe lipid stabilizing ability of the apple skin extracts was examined using an aqueous emulsion system of methyl linolenatethe total phenolic concentrations determined by highperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of methanolic extracts of skins of the apple genotypes varied from 150 to 700 mg100 g dwthe antioxidant capacity measured by folinciocalteu 162 to 341 mg gae100 g dw ferric reducing antioxidant power 13 to 33 g te100 g dw oxygen radical absorbance capacity 52 to 142 g te100 g dw and percent inhibition of oxidation of methyl linolenate 738 to 972 varied among the apple genotypesthe apple skin extracts specifically the crab apple varieties such as dolgo were revealed to be effective inhibitors of oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid in a model system and thus can be considered as a potential source of natural food antioxidants
