stevioside a constituent of stevia rebaudiana is commonly used as a noncaloric sugar substitute in japanthe genetic toxicities of stevioside and its aglycone steviol were examined with seven mutagenicity tests using bacteria reverse mutation assay forward mutation assay umu test and rec assay cultured mammalian cells chromosomal aberration test and gene mutation assay and mice micronucleus teststevioside was not mutagenic in any of the assays examinedthe aglycone steviol however produced doserelated positive responses in some mutagenicity tests iethe forward mutation assay using salmonella typhimurium tm677 the chromosomal aberration test using chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line chl and the gene mutation assay using chlmetabolic activation systems containing 9000 g supernatant fraction s9 of liver homogenates prepared from polychlorinated biphenyl or phenobarbital plus 56benzoflavonepretreated rats were required for mutagenesis and clastogenesissteviol was weakly positive in the umu test using styphimurium ta1535psk1002 either with or without the metabolic activation systemsteviol even in the presence of the s9 activation system was negative in other assays iethe reverse mutation assays using styphimurium ta97 ta98 ta100 ta102 ta104 ta1535 ta1537 and escherichia coli wp2 uvrapkm101 and the recassay using bacillus subtilissteviol was negative in the mouse micronucleus testthe genotoxic risk of steviol to humans is discussed
