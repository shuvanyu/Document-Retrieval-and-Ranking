anatoxina is a potent neurotoxin produced by several species of cyanobacteriathis alkaloid may cause fatal intoxication to exposed organisms and this has raised concerns over the increasing popularity of food supplements containing cyanobacteriathese are being marketed with alleged health properties for animal and human consumptionthese supplements most commonly contain the genera spirulina arthrospira and aphanizomenon and their consumption represent a potential route for anatoxina exposure in cases where adequate quality control is not undertakenin this work several dietary supplements containing cyanobacteria from different commercial suppliers were evaluated for the presence of anatoxina by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detectionadditionally the presence of the previously derivatized anatoxina was confirmed by using gas chromatographymass spectrometrya total of 39 samples were analysed in the studyresults showed that three of the samples 77 contained anatoxina at concentrations ranging from 250 to 33 microg g1quality control of cyanobacterial food supplements is required to avoid potential health effects in humans and animals
