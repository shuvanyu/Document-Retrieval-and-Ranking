the repertoire of gastrointestinal gi symptoms is finite however the etiologies and mechanisms underlying symptom generation and perception are diverse and in many cases unknownthis review examines the clinical and experimental evidence exploring the putative relationship between gluten sensitivity gs and the generation of gi symptomsit explores the hypothesis that in a proportion of patients gs causes functional bowel disorder fbdlike symptomswe propose a model for investigating and understanding the induction of gi symptoms and dysfunction by gluten in fbd and organic diseasewe hypothesize that even in the absence of fully developed celiac disease gluten can induce symptoms similar to fbdwe discuss the hypothesis that gs and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome ibs provide two triggers that can explain at least part of the spectrum that constitutes ibs further advancing an understanding of the role of mucosal responses to luminal factors in fbdswe propose that the animal model of gs in human leukocyte antigen hladq8 mice allows investigation of mucosal pathophysiological changes that occur before the onset of fullblown inflammation in a gs hosta better understanding of how gluten can cause symptoms in sensitive individuals will illuminate the interaction between host genotype diet and intestinal microbiota in generating one of the most common gi conditions
