objective the aim of this study was to screen for and quantify the neurotoxic amino acid betanmethylaminolalanine bmaa in a cohort of autopsy specimens taken from alzheimers disease ad amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als huntingtons disease hd and nonneurological controlsbmaa is produced by cyanobacteria found in a variety of freshwater marine and terrestrial habitatsthe possibility of geographically broad human exposure to bmaa had been suggested by the discovery of bmaa in brain tissues of chamorro patients with alsparkinsonism dementia complex from guam and more recently in ad patients from north americathese observations warranted an independent study of possible bmaa exposures outside of the guam ecosystemmethods postmortem brain specimens were taken from neuropathologically confirmed cases of 13 als 12 ad 8 hd patients and 12 agematched nonneurological controlsbmaa was quantified using a validated fluorescent hplc method previously used to detect bmaa in patients from guamtandem mass spectrometric ms analysis was carried out to confirm the identification of bmaa in neurological specimensresults we detected and quantified bmaa in neuroproteins from postmortem brain tissue of patients from the united states who died with sporadic ad and als but not hdincidental detections observed in two out of the 24 regions were analyzed from the controlsthe concentrations of bmaa were below what had been reported previously in chamarro als parkinsonism dementia complex patients but demonstrated a twofold range across disease and regional brain area comparisonsthe presence of bmaa in these patients was confirmed by triple quadrupole liquid chromatographymass spectrometrymass spectrometryconclusions the occurrence of bmaa in north american als and ad patients suggests the possibility of a geneenvironment interaction with bmaa triggering neurodegeneration in vulnerable individualsc 2009 the authors journal compilation c 2009 blackwell munksgaard
