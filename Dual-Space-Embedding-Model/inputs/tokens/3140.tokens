background telomeres are protective dnaprotein complexes at the end of linear chromosomes that promote chromosomal stabilitytelomere shortness in human beings is emerging as a prognostic marker of disease risk progression and premature mortality in many types of cancer including breast prostate colorectal bladder head and neck lung and renal celltelomere shortening is counteracted by the cellular enzyme telomeraselifestyle factors known to promote cancer and cardiovascular disease might also adversely affect telomerase functionhowever previous studies have not addressed whether improvements in nutrition and lifestyle are associated with increases in telomerase activitywe aimed to assess whether 3 months of intensive lifestyle changes increased telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcmethods 30 men with biopsydiagnosed lowrisk prostate cancer were asked to make comprehensive lifestyle changesthe primary endpoint was telomerase enzymatic activity per viable cell measured at baseline and after 3 months24 patients had sufficient pbmcs needed for longitudinal analysisthis study is registered on the clinicaltrialsgov website number nct00739791findings pbmc telomerase activity expressed as natural logarithms increased from 200 sd 044 to 222 sd 049 p0031raw values of telomerase increased from 805 sd 350 standard arbitrary units to 1038 sd 601 standard arbitrary unitsthe increases in telomerase activity were significantly associated with decreases in lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol r036 p0041 and decreases in psychological distress r035 p0047interpretation comprehensive lifestyle changes significantly increase telomerase activity and consequently telomere maintenance capacity in human immunesystem cellsgiven this finding and the pilot nature of this study we report these increases in telomerase activity as a significant association rather than inferring causationlarger randomised controlled trials are warranted to confirm the findings of this study
