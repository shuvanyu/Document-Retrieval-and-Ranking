in this study magnetic resonance imaging mri was applied to study the structural aspects of the tomato fruitthe main study was performed on tomatoes cvtradiro using a 02t electromagnet scannerspinecho images were acquired to visualize the tomato macrostructurethe air bubble content in tissues was evaluated by exploiting susceptibility effects using multiple gradient echo imagesthe microstructure was further studied by measuring spinspin t2 and spinlattice t1 relaxation time distributionsnuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry macro vision imaging and chemical analysis were used as complementary and independent experimental methods in order to emphasize the mri resultsmri images showed that the air bubble content varied between tissuesthe presence of gas was attested by macro vision imagesquantitative imaging showed that t2 and t1 maps obtained by mri reflected the structural differences between tomato tissues and made it possible to distinguish between themthe results indicated that cell size and chemical composition contribute to the relaxation mechanism
