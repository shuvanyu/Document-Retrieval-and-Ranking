objectives previous research has demonstrated that patients with prostate cancer participating in the prostate cancer lifestyle trial had a reduction in prostatespecific antigen psa levels inhibition of lncap cell growth and fewer prostate cancerrelated clinical events at the end of 1 year compared with controlsthe aim of this study was to examine the clinical events in this trial during a 2year periodmethods the prostate cancer lifestyle trial was a 1year randomized controlled clinical trial of 93 patients with earlystage prostate cancer gleason score 7 psa 410 ngml undergoing active surveillancethe patients in the experimental arm were encouraged to adopt a lowfat plantbased diet to exercise and practice stress management and to attend group support sessionsthe control patients received the usual careresults by 2 years of followup 13 of 49 27 control patients and 2 of 43 5 experimental patients had undergone conventional prostate cancer treatment radical prostatectomy radiotherapy or androgen deprivation p  05no differences were found between the groups in other clinical events eg cardiac and no deaths occurredthree of the treated control patients but none of the treated experimental patients had a psa level of or10 ngml and 1 treated control patient but no treated experimental patients had a psa velocity of 2 ngmly before treatmentno significant differences were found between the untreated experimental and untreated control patients in psa change or velocity at the end of 2 yearsconclusions patients with earlystage prostate cancer choosing active surveillance might be able to avoid or delay conventional treatment for at least 2 years by making changes in their diet and lifestyle
