the current annual incidence of sudden cardiac death in the us is likely to be in the range of 180250000 per yearcoinciding with the decreased mortality from coronary artery disease there is evidence pointing toward a significant decrease in rates of sudden cardiac death in the us during the second half of the twentieth centuryhowever the alarming rise in prevalence of obesity and diabetes in the first decade of the new millennium both in the us and worldwide would indicate that this favorable trend is unlikely to persistwe are likely to witness a resurgence of coronary artery disease and heart failure as a result of which sudden cardiac death will have to be confronted as a shared and indiscriminate worldwide public health problemthere is also increasing recognition of the fact that discovery of meaningful and relevant risk stratification and prevention methodologies will require careful prospective communitywide analyses with access to large archives of dna serum and tissue that link with wellphenotyped databasesthe purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge of sudden cardiac death epidemiologywe will discuss the significance and strengths of communitywide evaluations of sudden cardiac death summarize recent observations from such studies and finally highlight specific potential predictors that warrant further evaluation as determinants of sudden cardiac death in the general population
