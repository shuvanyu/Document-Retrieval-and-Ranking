consumption of cows milk and cows milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin growth hormone and insulinlike growth factor1igf1 in humansmilk consumption raises igf1 serum levels in the perinatal period adolescence and adulthoodduring puberty with the physiological onset of increased secretion of growth hormone igf1 serum levels increase and are further enhanced by milk consumptionigf1 is a potent mitogen after binding to its receptor in various tissues it induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosiskeratinocytes and sebocytes as well as the androgensynthesizing adrenals and gonads are stimulated by igf1the epidemic incidence of adolescent acne in western milkconsuming societies can be explained by the increased insulin and igf1stimulation of sebaceous glands mediated by milk consumptionacne can be regarded as a model for chronic western diseases with pathologically increased igf1stimulationmany other organs such as the thymus bones all glands and vascular smooth muscle cells as well as neurons are subject to this abnormally increased hormonal stimulationthe milkinduced change of the igf1axis most likely contributes to the development of fetal macrosomia induction of atopy accelerated linear growth atherosclerosis carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseasesobservations of molecular biology are supported by epidemiologic data and unmask milk consumption as a promoter of chronic diseases of western societies
