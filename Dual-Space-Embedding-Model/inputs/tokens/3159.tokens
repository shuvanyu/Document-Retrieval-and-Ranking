increased levels of estrogen metabolites em are associated with cancers of the reproductive systemone potential dietary source of em is milkin this study the absolute quantities of unconjugated free and unconjugated plus conjugated total em were measured in a variety of commercial milks whole 2 skim and buttermilkthe results show that the milk products tested contain considerable levels of em however the levels of unconjugated em in skim milk were substantially lower than that observed in whole milk 2 milk and buttermilkwhole milk contained the lowest overall levels of em while buttermilk contained the highestas anticipated soy milk did not contain the mammalian em measured using this methodthe relatively high levels of catechol estrogens detected in milk products support the theory that milk consumption is a source of em and their ingestion may have a dietary influence on cancer risk
