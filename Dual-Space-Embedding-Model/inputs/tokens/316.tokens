in 1997 this laboratory initiated a research program with the objective of examining the effect that rinsing of produce with tap water would have on pesticide residuessamples were obtained from local markets andor grown at our experimental farmbecause approximately 35 of produce from retail sources contains pesticide residues growing and treating produce at an experimental farm had the advantage that all such samples contain pesticide residuespesticides were applied under normal field conditions to a variety of food crops and the vegetation was allowed to undergo natural weathering prior to harvestthe resulting samples contained fieldincurred or fieldfortified residuesthis experimental design was employed to mimic as closely as possible real world samplescrops were treated harvested and divided into equal subsamplesone subsample was processed unwashed whereas the other was rinsed under tap waterthe extraction and analysis method used was a multiresidue method developed in our laboratorytwelve pesticides were included in this study the fungicides captan chlorothalonil iprodione and vinclozolin and the insecticides endosulfan permethrin methoxychlor malathion diazinon chlorpyrifos bifenthrin and dde a soil metabolite of ddtstatistical analysis of the data using the wilcoxon signedrank test showed that rinsing removed residues for nine of the twelve pesticides studiedresidues of vinclozolin bifenthrin and chlorpyrifos were not reducedthe rinsability of a pesticide is not correlated with its water solubility
