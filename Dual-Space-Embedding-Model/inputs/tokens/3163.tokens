the antioxidant properties of dietary phenolics are believed to be reduced in vivo because of their affinity for proteinsin this study we assessed the bioavailability of phenolics and the in vivo plasma antioxidant capacity after the consumption of blueberries vaccinium corymbosum l with and without milkin a crossover design 11 healthy human volunteers consumed either a 200 g of blueberries plus 200 ml of water or b 200 g of blueberries plus 200 ml of whole milkvenous samples were collected at baseline and at 1 2 and 5 h postconsumptioningestion of blueberries increased plasma levels of reducing and chainbreaking potential 61 p0001 111 p005 and enhanced plasma concentrations of caffeic and ferulic acidwhen blueberries and milk were ingested there was no increase in plasma antioxidant capacitythere was a reduction in the peak plasma concentrations of caffeic and ferulic acid 497 p0001 and 198 p005 respectively as well as the overall absorption auc of caffeic acid p0001the ingestion of blueberries in association with milk thus impairs the in vivo antioxidant properties of blueberries and reduces the absorption of caffeic acid
