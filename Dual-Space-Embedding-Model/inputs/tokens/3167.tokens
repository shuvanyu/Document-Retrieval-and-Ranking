the fact that aluminium al and lead pb are both toxic metals to living organisms including human beings was discovered a long time agoeven when al and pb can reach and accumulate in almost every organ in the human body the central nervous system is a particular target of the deleterious effects of both metalsselect human population can be at risk of al neurotoxicity and al is proposed to be involved in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseasespb is a widespread environmental hazard and the neurotoxic effects of pb are a major public health concernin spite of the numerous efforts and the accumulating evidence in this area of research the mechanisms of al and pb neurotoxicity are still not completely elucidatedthis review will particularly address the involvement of oxidative stress membrane biophysics alterations deregulation of cell signaling and the impairment of neurotransmission as key aspects involved al and pb neurotoxicity
