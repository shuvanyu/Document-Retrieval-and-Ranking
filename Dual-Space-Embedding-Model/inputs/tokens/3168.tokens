oral aluminum al bioavailability from drinking water has been previously estimated but there is little information on al bioavailability from foodsit was suggested that oral al bioavailability from drinking water is much greater than from foodsthe objective was to further test this hypothesisoral al bioavailability was determined in the rat from basic 26alsodium aluminum phosphate basic salp in a process cheeseconsumption of  1 gm cheese containing 15 or 3 basic salp resulted in oral al bioavailability f of  01 and 03 respectively and time to maximum serum 26al concentration tmax of 8 to 9 h these al bioavailability results were intermediate to previously reported results from drinking water f  03 and acidicsalp incorporated into a biscuit f  01 using the same methodsconsidering the similar oral bioavailability of al from food vs water and their contribution to the typical humans daily al intake  95 and 15 respectively these results suggest food contributes much more al to systemic circulation and potential al body burden than does drinking waterthese results do not support the hypothesis that drinking water provides a disproportionate contribution to total al absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
