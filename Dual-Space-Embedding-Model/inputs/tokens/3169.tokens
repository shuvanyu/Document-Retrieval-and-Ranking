arsenic exposures contribute significantly to the burden of preventable disease worldwide specifically related to increased risks of cancer diabetes and cardiovascular diseasemost exposures are associated with natural contamination of groundwater which is difficult to mitigate when these sources are used for drinking wateran anthropogenic source of arsenic exposure stems from the widespread use of arsenical drugs in foodanimal production in the united states and china among many countriesthis use results in residual contamination of food products from animals raised with the drugs as well as environmental contamination associated with disposal of wastes from these animalsland disposal of these wastes can contaminate surface and ground water and the conversion of animal wastes into fertilizer pellets for home use as well as the introduction of animal waste incinerators may increase opportunities for exposureas an intentional additive to animal feed use of arsenical drugs is a preventable source of human exposurethe domestic practice of using these drugs in poultry production has been the subject of media attention and limited research though the use of these drugs in domestic swine production and in the rapidly growing foreign animal production industry remains largely uncharacterizedthis continued expansion of arsenical drug use may likely increase the burden of global human arsenic exposure and risk
