the efficiencies of acidic solutions radish citric acid ascorbic acid acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide neutral solutions sodium chloride and alkaline solution sodium carbonate as well as tap water in the elimination of organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides from naturally contaminated potatoes were examinedthe results indicated that acidic solutions were more effective than neutral and alkaline solutions in the elimination of the organochlorine compounds under investigation radish solutions eliminated pesticides completely except opdde 731 loss followed by citric and ascorbic acid solutionson the other hand organophosphorus pesticides pirimphos methyl malathion and profenofos were eliminated more by acidic neutral and alkaline solutions than by organochlorinesthe percentage of removal ranged from 985 to 100 for pirimphos methyl 879 to 100 for malathion and 100 for profenofos
