rice is more elevated in arsenic than all other grain crops tested to date with whole grain brown rice having higher arsenic levels than polished whiteit is reported here that rice bran both commercially purchased and specifically milled for this study have levels of inorganic arsenic a nonthreshold class 1 carcinogen reaching concentrations of approximately 1 mgkg dry weight around 1020 fold higher than concentrations found in bulk grainalthough pure rice bran is used as a health food supplement perhaps of more concern is rice bran solubles which are marketed as a superfood and as a supplement to malnourished children in international aid programsfive rice bran solubles products were tested sourced from the united states and japan and were found to have 06119 mgkg inorganic arsenicmanufactures recommend approximately 20 g servings of the rice bran solubles per day which equates to a 00120038 mg intake of inorganic arsenicthere are no maximum concentration levels mcls set for arsenic or its species in food stuffseu and us water regulations set at 001 mgl total or inorganic arsenic respectively are based on the assumption that 1 l of water per day is consumed ie 001 mg of arsenic dayat the manufacturers recommended rice bran solubles consumption rate inorganic arsenic intake exceeds 001 mg day remembering that rice bran solubles are targeted at malnourished children and that actual risk is based on mg kg1 day1 intake
