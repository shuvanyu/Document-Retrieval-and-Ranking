agaritine ngammalglutamyl4hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine was identified and quantified by highpressure liquid chromatography and used as a marker for the occurrence of phenylhydrazine derivatives in the cultivated agaricus bitorquis and a garicus hortensis mushroomsalthough relatively high levels of agaritine around 700 mg kg1 could be found in freshly harvested a bitorquis from early flushes samples from supermarkets contained less agaritinethe content of 28 samples varied between 165 and 457 mg kg1 on average being 272  69 mg kg1the highest amounts of agaritine were found in the skin of the cap and in the gills the lowest being in the stemthere was no significant difference in agaritine content of the two mushroom species in our studypronounced reduction in agaritine content was observed during storage of mushrooms in the refrigerator or freezer as well as during drying of the mushroomsthe degree of reduction was dependent on the length and condition of storage and was usually in the region 2075no reduction in agaritine content was observed during freezedryingdepending on the cooking procedure household processing of cultivated agaricus mushrooms reduced the agaritine content to various degreesboiling extracted around 50 of the agaritine content into the cooking broth within 5min and degraded 2025 of the original agaritine content of the mushroomsprolonged boiling as when preparing a sauce reduced the content in the solid mushroom further around 10 left after 2hdry baking of the cultivated mushroom a process similar to pizza baking reduced the agaritine content by approximately 25 whereas frying in oil or butter or deep frying resulted in a more marked reduction 3570microwave processing of the cultivated mushrooms reduced the agaritine content to onethird of the original levelthus the exposure to agaritine was substantially less when consuming processed agaricus mushrooms as compared with consuming the raw mushroomshowever it is not yet known to what extent agaritine and other phenylhydrazine derivatives occurring in the cultivated mushroom are degraded into other biologically active compounds during the cooking procedure
