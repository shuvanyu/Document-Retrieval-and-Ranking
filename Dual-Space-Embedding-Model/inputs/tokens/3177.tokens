objective mass screening for celiac disease is controversialthe objective of this study was to determine whether detection of childhood celiac disease by mass screening improves longterm health status and healthrelated quality of lifemethods we conducted a prospective 10year followup study of 32 children who were aged 2 to 4 years had celiac disease identified by mass screening and had a glutenfree diet 19 or a normal glutencontaining diet 13the followup included assessments of general health status celiac diseaseassociated symptoms celiac diseaseassociated serum antibodies and healthrelated quality of liferesults ten years after mass screening 81 of the children were adhering to a glutenfree dietthe health status improved in 66 of the treated children in 41 by early treatment and in 25 by prevention of the glutendependent symptoms that they developed after diagnosisfor 19 of the children treatment after screening would not have improved their health status because they had no symptoms at screening and have remained symptomfree while consuming glutenthe healthrelated quality of life of the children with symptoms improved significantly after 1 year of glutenfree dietten years after screening the healthrelated quality of life of the children with celiac disease was similar to that of the reference populationconclusion identification by mass screening led 10 years later to health improvement in 66 of children without deterioration of generic healthrelated quality of lifethere is a good compliance after mass screeningin a research setting delaying treatment for children without symptoms seems to be an option after a positive screening testlongterm followup studies are needed to assess possible longterm complications in untreated nonsymptomatic celiac disease
