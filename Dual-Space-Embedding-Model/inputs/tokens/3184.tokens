background observational studies suggested that a diet high in fruits and vegetables both of which are rich with antioxidants may prevent cancer developmenthowever findings from randomized trials of the association between antioxidant use and cancer risk have been mostly negativemethods from 8171 women who were randomly assigned in the womens antioxidant cardiovascular study a doubleblind placebocontrolled 2  2  2 factorial trial of vitamin c 500 mg of ascorbic acid daily naturalsource vitamin e 600 iu of Î±tocopherol every other day and beta carotene 50 mg every other day 7627 women who were free of cancer before random assignment were selected for this studydiagnoses and deaths from cancer at a specific site were confirmed by use of hospital reports and the national death indexcox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess hazard ratios represented as relative risks rrs of common cancers associated with use of antioxidants either individually or in combinationsubgroup analyses were conducted to determine if duration of use modified the association of supplement use with cancer riskall statistical tests were twosidedresults during an average 94 years of treatment 624 women developed incident invasive cancer and 176 women died from cancerthere were no statistically significant effects of use of any antioxidant on total cancer incidencecompared with the placebo group the rrs were 111 95 confidence interval ci  095 to 130 in the vitamin c group 093 95 ci  079 to 109 in the vitamin e group and 100 95 ci  085 to 117 in the beta carotene groupsimilarly no effects of these antioxidants were observed on cancer mortalitycompared with the placebo group the rrs were 128 95 ci  095 to 173 in the vitamin c group 087 95 ci  065 to 117 in the vitamin e group and 084 95 ci  062 to 113 in the beta carotene groupduration and combined use of the three antioxidants also had no effect on cancer incidence and cancer deathconclusions supplementation with vitamin c vitamin e or beta carotene offers no overall benefits in the primary prevention of total cancer incidence or cancer mortality
