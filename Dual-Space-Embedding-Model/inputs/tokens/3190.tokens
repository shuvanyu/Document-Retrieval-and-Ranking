polychlorinated naphthalenes pcns are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic contaminantsprior to this study the occurrence of pcns in human adipose tissues from the usa has not been analyzedhere we have measured concentrations of pcns in human adipose tissue samples collected in new york city during 20032005concentrations of pcns were in the range of 612500pgg lipid wtin males and 21910pgg lipid wtin femalespcn congeners 5260 1235712467 and 6667 123467123567 were predominant collectively accounting for 66 of the total pcn concentrationsconcentrations of pcns in human adipose tissues were 23 orders of magnitude lower than the previously reported concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdesconcentrations of pcns were not correlated with pcb concentrationsthe contribution of pcns to dioxinlike toxic equivalents teqs in human adipose tissues was estimated to be 1 of the polychlorinated dibenzopdioxindibenzofuran pcddfteqs
