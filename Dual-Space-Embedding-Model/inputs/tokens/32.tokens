objective a variety of charcoalcontaining devices are purported to minimize problems with odoriferous rectal gas however the evidence supporting the efficacy of these products is virtually all anecdotalwe objectively evaluated the ability of these devices to adsorb two malodorous sulfide gases hydrogen sulfide and methylmercaptan instilled at the anusmethods via a tube 100 ml of nitrogen containing 40 ppm of sulfide gases and 05 h2 was instilled at the anus of six healthy volunteers who wore gas impermeable mylar pantaloons over their garmentssince h2 is not adsorbed by charcoal the fraction of the sulfide gases removed could be determined from the concentration ratio of sulfide gas h2 in the pantaloon space relative to the ratio in instilled gasresults measurements with no device in place showed that subjects garments removed 220  53 of the sulfide gases and results obtained with each device were corrected for this removalthe only product that adsorbed virtually all of the sulfide gases was briefs constructed from an activated carbon fiber fabricpads worn inside the underwear removed 5577 of the sulfide gasesmost cushions were relatively ineffective adsorbing about 20 of the gasesconclusions the ability of charcoalcontaining devices to adsorb odoriferous rectal gases is limited by incomplete exposure of the activated carbon to the gasesbriefs made from carbon fiber are highly effective pads are less effective removing 5577 of the odor cushions are relatively ineffective
