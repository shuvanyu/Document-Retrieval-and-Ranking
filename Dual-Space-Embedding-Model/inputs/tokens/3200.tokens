in order to assess early neurotoxic effects associated with relatively low levels of mercury absorbed through fish eating two groups of 22 adult male subjects habitual consumers of tuna fish and 22 controls were examined using a crosssectional field studythe assessment included neurobehavioral tests of vigilance and psychomotor function hand tremor measurements and serum prolactin assessmentmercury in urine uhg and serum prolactin sprl were measured in all exposed subjects and controls whereas measurements of the organic component of mercury in blood ohg were available for only 10 exposed and six controlsuhg was significant higher among exposed subjects median 65 microgg of creatinine range 18215 than controls median 15 microgg of creatinine range 0553the median values of ohg were 415 microgl among the tuna fish eaters and 26 microgl in the control groupboth uhg and ohg were significantly correlated with the quantity of fish consumed per weeksignificant differences in sprl were found between exposed 126 ngml and controls 91 ngmlindividual sprl were significantly correlated with both uhg and ohg levelsthe neurobehavioral performance of subjects who consumed tuna fish regularly was significantly worse on color word reaction time digit symbol reaction time and finger tapping speed ftafter considering the education level and other covariates the multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that ohg concentration was most significantly associated with individual performance on these tests accounting for about 65 of the variance in test scores
