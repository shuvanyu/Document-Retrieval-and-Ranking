biogenic amines are nonvolatile amines formed by decarboxylation of amino acidsalthough many biogenic amines have been found in fish only histamine cadaverine and putrescine have been found to be significant in fish safety and quality determinationdespite a widely reported association between histamine and scombroid food poisoning histamine alone appears to be insufficient to cause food toxicityputrescine and cadaverine have been suggested to potentiate histamine toxicitywith respect to spoilage on the other hand only cadaverine has been found to be a useful index of the initial stage of fish decompositionthe relationship between biogenic amines sensory evaluation and trimethylamine during spoilage are influenced by bacterial composition and free amino acid contenta mesophilic bacterial count of log 67 cfug has been found to be associated with 5 mg histamine100 g fish the food and drug administration fda maximum allowable histamine levelin vitro studies have shown the involvement of cadaverine and putrescine in the formation of nitrosamines nitrosopiperidine npip and nitrosopyrrolidine npyr respectivelyin addition impure salt high temperature and low ph enhance nitrosamine formation whereas pure sodium chloride inhibits their formationunderstanding the relationships between biogenic amines and their involvement in the formation of nitrosamines could explain the mechanism of scombroid poisoning and assure the safety of many fish products
