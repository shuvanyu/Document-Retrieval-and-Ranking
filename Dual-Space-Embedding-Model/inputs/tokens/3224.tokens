urinary monohydroxy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ohpahs are a class of pah metabolites used as biomarkers for assessing human exposure to pahsthe centers for disease control and preventions national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes uses ohpahs to establish reference range concentrations for the us population and to set benchmarks for future epidemiologic and biomonitoring studiesfor the years 2001 and 2002 22 ohpah metabolites were measured in urine specimens from 2748 nhanes participantspercentages of samples with detectable levels ranged from nearly 100 for metabolites of naphthalene fluorene phenanthrene and pyrene to less than 5 for metabolites from parent compounds with higher molecular weight such as chrysene benzocphenanthrene and benzaanthracenethe geometric mean for 1hydroxypyrene 1pyrthe most commonly used biomarker for pah exposurewas 496 ngl urine or 464 ngg creatininechildren ages 611 generally had higher levels than did adolescents ages 1219 or adults ages 20 and oldermodeladjusted leastsquare geometric means for 1pyr were 87 53 and 43 ngl for children adolescents ages 1219 and adults ages 20 years and older respectivelylogtransformed concentrations for major detectable ohpahs were significantly correlated with each otherthe correlation coefficients between 1pyr and other metabolites ranging from 017 to 063 support the use of 1pyr as a useful surrogate representing pah exposure
