background children from lowincome families may be subject to high exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah which can lead to respiratory disordersthis study aims to establish methods for assessing total pah exposure of asthmatic and nonasthmatic children from lowincome families to estimate serum pah concentrations of these children and to estimate the relative importance of the environmental pathways for pah exposurematerials and methods a total of 75 61 asthmatic 14 nonasthmatic saudi children 15 years old and below were included to participate in this crosssectional studyeach participant answered a generalized questionnaire with dietary questionsserum pah were measured using hplc with uv detectionresults serum naphthalene and pyrene were significantly elevated among asthmatic children pvalues  0007 and 001 respectivelyserum acenaphthylene fluorine and 12benzanthracene on the other hand were significantly higher among nonasthmatics pvalues  0001 004 and 003 respectivelythere was a significant correlation between the presence of a smoker in the family and serum concentrations of carbazole pyrene 12benzanthracene and benzacephenanthrylene r  037 045 043 033 pvalues  001 00002 0003 and 0025 respectivelysignificant correlations were elicited between daily meat intake and serum levels of acenaphthylene benzopyrene and 12benzanthracene r  027 027 033 pvalues  002 and  0001 respectivelyconclusion among the children serum pah were significantly correlated to meat intake as well as presence of smokers at homepublic health awareness should be enhanced by educating parents to take certain precautions at home such as preventing indoor smoking and reducing the intake of grilled and smoked meat by children so as to decrease their exposure to carcinogenic pah
