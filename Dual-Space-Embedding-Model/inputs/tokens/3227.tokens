airborne cooking byproducts from frying beef hamburgers pork bacon strips and soybeanbased food tempeh burgers were collected extracted tested for mutagenicity and chemically analysedthe fumes generated by frying pork and beef were mutagenic with 4900 and 1300 revertantsg of food cooked respectivelyno mutagenicity was detected in fumes from frying tempeh burgersbacon fried to a welldone but noncharred state was eight times more mutagenic in a microsuspension amessalmonella test ta98 with s9 than hamburgers and about 350 times more mutagenic than tempeh burgersamong food samples cooked to a welldone noncharred state bacon strips had almost 15fold more mass 1095 ngg than that of the beef whereas no heterocyclic amine hca was detected in the fried tempeh burgers2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip was the most abundant hca followed by 2amino38dimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline meiqx and 2amino348trimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline dimeiqxno 2amino9hpyrido23bindole a alpha c was detected in the food samples fried at about 200 degrees c although it was present in the collected airborne productsthe total amounts of hcas in the smoke condensates were 3 ngg from fried bacon 037 ngg from fried beef and 0177 ngg from fried soybased foodthis study indicates that cooks are potentially exposed to relatively high levels of airborne mutagens and carcinogens and that longterm sampling inside restaurants and kitchens may be warranted in order to assess the potential risk of prolonged exposure
