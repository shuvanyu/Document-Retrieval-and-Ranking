human risk assessment of exposure to 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip through the diet may be improved by conducting biomonitoring studies comparing metabolism in humans and rodentseleven volunteers ingested a meal of cooked chicken containing 4 ohphip and phip in amounts of 06 and 08microgkg respectively and urine was collected for the next 16hthe large number of phip metabolites was by treatment of the urine samples with hydrazine hydrate and hydrolytic enzymes reduced to three substances 4ohphip phip and 5ohphip of which the first is a biomarker for detoxification and the last a biomarker for activationthe eleven volunteers eliminated large amounts of 4ohphip in the urinethe majority of which could be accounted for by the presence of 4ohphip in the fried chicken showing that phip only to a small extent 11 was metabolised to 4ohphipa larger fraction of the phip exposure 38 was recovered as phip and the largest fraction 51 was recovered as 5ohphip suggesting that phip in humans to a large extent is metabolised to reactive substancesin rats less than 1 of the dose of phip was eliminated as 5ohphip suggesting that human cancer risk from exposure to phip is considerable higher than risk estimations based on extrapolation from rodent bioassays
