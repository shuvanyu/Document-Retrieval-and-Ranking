feasibility of fluorescence imaging technique for the detection of diluted fecal matters from various parts of the digestive tract including colon ceca small intestine and duodenum on poultry carcasses was investigatedone of the challenges for using fluorescence imaging for inspection of agricultural material is the low fluorescence yield in that fluorescence can be masked by ambient lighta laserinduced fluorescence imaging system lifis developed by our group allowed acquisition of fluorescence from fecescontaminated poultry carcasses in ambient lightfluorescence emission images at 630 nm were captured with 415nm laser excitationimage processing algorithms including threshold and image erosion were used to identify fecal spots diluted up to 1 10 by weight with double distilled waterfeces spots on the carcasses without dilution and up to 1 5 dilutions could be detected with 100 accuracy regardless of feces typedetection accuracy for fecal matters diluted up to 1 10 was 966the results demonstrated good potential of the lifis for detection of diluted poultry fecal matter which can harbor pathogens on poultry carcasses
