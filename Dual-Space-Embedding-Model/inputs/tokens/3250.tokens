genistein a major soy isoflavone has been reported to exhibit antiadipogenic and proapoptotic potential in vivo and in vitroit is also a phytoestrogen which has high affinity to estrogen receptor betain this study we determined the effect of genistein on adipogenesis and estrogen receptor er alpha and beta expression during differentiation in primary human preadipocytesgenistein inhibited lipid accumulation in a dosedependent manner at concentrations of 625 microm and higher with 50 microm genistein inhibiting lipid accumulation almost completelylow concentrations of genistein 325 microm increased cell viability and higher concentrations 25 and 50 microm decreased it by 1648135 p0001 and 5068134 p0001oil red o staining was used to confirm the effects on lipid accumulationthe inhibition of lipid accumulation was associated with inhibition of glycerol3phosphate dehydrogenase activity and downregulation of expression of adipocytespecific genes including peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma ccaatenhancer binding protein alpha glycerol3phosphate dehydrogenase adipocyte fatty acid binding protein fatty acid synthase sterol regulatory elementbinding protein 1 perilipin leptin lipoprotein lipase and hormonesensitive lipasethese effects of genistein during the differentiation period were associated with downregulation of eralpha and erbeta expressionthis study adds to the elucidation of the molecular pathways involved in the inhibition of adipogenesis by phytoestrogens
