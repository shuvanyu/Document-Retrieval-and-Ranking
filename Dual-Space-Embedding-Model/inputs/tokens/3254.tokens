circulating adiponectin is emerging as an important link between obesity type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvdhowever the spectrum of lifestyle factors that modulate the adiponectin concentration remains to be elucidated particularly among womenwe conducted a crosssectional study of 877 female twin pairs from the twinsuk adult twin registryusing a cotwin design we examined dietary and body composition influences on adiponectin by conducting matched withinpair analyses to eliminate confoundingfollowing multivariable adjustment withintwin pairs significant influences on adiponectin logtransformed percent change per sd of the dietarybody composition variable were observed for nonstarch polysaccharides 325 95 ci 006 654 p  005 and magnesium intake 380 95ci 017 757 p  005 with a trend toward an association for fruit and vegetable fv intakes 255 95 ci 026 545 p  008these modest positive associations cannot be explained by confounding through other lifestyle factors shared by the twinsa significant relationship between adiponectin and 3 derived dietary patterns fv dieting traditional english carbohydrate protein trans fat and alcohol intake was also observedstrong inverse associations with adiponectin were observed for bmi 1072 95 ci 1378 755 total 689 95 ci 1034 330 p  005 and central fat mass 1250 95 ci 1582 905 p  005 these relationships were significant both when twins were analyzed as individuals and when characteristics were contrasted withintwin pairs suggesting a direct effectwe observed modest associations between dietary factors and adiponectin in female twins independent of adiposity and report strong inverse associations with body compositionthese data reinforce the importance of weight maintenance and increasing consumption of diets rich in plantbased foods to prevent cvd and type 2 diabetes
