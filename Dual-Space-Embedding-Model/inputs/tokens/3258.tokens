av119 is a patented blend of two sugars from avocado that can induce human betadefensin2 production by normal human keratinocytesin this study we analysed the effect of av119 on growth and invasiveness of malassezia furfur a dimorphic lipiddependent yeast that is part of the normal human cutaneous commensal florathe ability to modulate the expression of the proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines in normal human keratinocytes was also investigatedmicrobiological assay demonstrated that this sugar induced the aggregation of yeast cells and inhibited the invasiveness of m furfur without affecting its growthrealtime pcr analysis demonstrated that av119 was able to modulate the hbd2 response in treated keratinocytes reaching a maximum after 48h treatment and to induce the recovery of a satisfactory proinflammatory response in human keratinocytesas av119 can induce aggregation of yeast cells thus inhibiting their penetration into the keratinocytes the sugar could be used in the preparation of cosmetics or pharmacological drugs to inhibit colonization of the skin by pathogenic strains of m furfur
