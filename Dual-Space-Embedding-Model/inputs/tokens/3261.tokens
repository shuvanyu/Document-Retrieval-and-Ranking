several nutrition and nonnutritional pathways are recognised in the development and occurrence of cardiovascular diseasein many populations high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease chd mortalityhowever several studies report that hyperlipidaemia and heart diseases are not common among populations who consume coconut a source of saturated fata casecontrol study was conducted among the minangkabau known to be high coconut consumers to examine the difference in food patterns and risk of coronary heart disease chd between the coronary cases and their gender and agematched apparently healthy counterparts serving as controlseligible subjects with chd were identified through the cooperation of five participating hospitals located in padang and bukittinggi in west sumatra indonesiaa total of 93 eligible cases 62 men and 31 women in the case group and 189 subjects 113 men and 76 women in the control group were recruitedinformation on the intakes of individual foods and dishes over the preceding 12 months was obtained using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnairethe case groups had significantly higher intakes of meats eggs sugar tea coffee and fruits but lower intakes of soy products rice and cereals compared to the controlscoconut consumption as flesh or milk was not different between cases and controlsthe cases had significantly higher intakes of protein and cholesterol but lower intake of carbohydratesimilar intakes of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids between the cases and controls indicated that the consumption of total fat or saturated fat including that from coconut was not a predictor for chd in this food culturehowever the intakes of animal foods total protein dietary cholesterol and less plant derived carbohydrates were predictors of chd
