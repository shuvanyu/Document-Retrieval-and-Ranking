bioactivityguided fractionation of red delicious apple peels was used to determine the chemical identity of bioactive constituents which showed potent antiproliferative and antioxidant activitiestwentynine compounds including triterpenoids flavonoids organic acids and plant sterols were isolated using gradient solvent fractionation diaion hp20 silica gel and ods columns and preparative hplctheir chemical structures were identified using hrms and 1d and 2d nmrantiproliferative activities of isolated pure compounds against hepg2 human liver cancer cells and mcf7 human breast cancer cells were evaluatedon the basis of the yields of isolated flavonoids compounds 18 23 the major flavonoids in apple peels are quercetin3obetadglucopyranoside compound 20 826 then quercetin3obetadgalactopyranoside compound 19 171 followed by trace amounts of quercetin compound 18 02 catechin compound 22 epicatechin compound 23 and quercetin3oalphalarabinofuranoside compound 21among the compounds isolated quercetin 18 and quercetin3obetadglucopyranoside 20 showed potent antiproliferative activities against hepg2 and mcf7 cells with ec 50 values of 409  11 and 492  49 microm to hepg2 cells and 1375  26 and 239  39 microm to mcf7 cells respectivelysix flavonoids 1823 and three phenolic compounds 10 11 and 14 showed potent antioxidant activitiescaffeic acid 10 quercetin 18 and quercetin3obetadarabinofuranoside 21 showed higher antioxidant activity with ec 50 values of 10 micrommost tested flavonoids and phenolic compounds had high antioxidant activity when compared to ascorbic acid and might be responsible for the antioxidant activities of applesthese results showed apple peel phytochemicals have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activities
