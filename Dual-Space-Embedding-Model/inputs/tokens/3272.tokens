gel filtration chromatography ultrafiltration and solidphase extraction silica gel cleanup were evaluated for their ability to remove microcystins selectively from extracts of cyanobacteria spirulina samples after using the reversedphase octadecylsilyl ods cartridge for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lcmsmsthe reversedphase ods cartridgesilica gel combination were effective and the optimal wash and elution conditions were h2o wash 20 methanol in water wash and 90 methanol in water elution for the reversedphase ods cartridge followed by 80 methanol in water elution in the silica gel cartridgethe presence of microcystins in 36 kinds of cyanobacteria spirulina health food samples obtained from various retail outlets in china were detected by lcmsms and 34 samples 94 contained microcystins ranging from 2 to 163 ng g1 mean  14  27 ng g1 which were significantly lower than microcystins present in blue green alga products previously reportedmcrr  which contains two molecules of arginine r  in 944 samples was the predominant microcystin followed by mclr  where l is leucine  306 and mcyr  where y is tyrose  278the possible potential health risks from chronic exposure to microcystins from contaminated cyanobacteria spirulina health food should not be ignored even if the toxin concentrations were lowthe method presented herein is proposed to detect microcystins present in commercial cyanobacteria spirulina samples
