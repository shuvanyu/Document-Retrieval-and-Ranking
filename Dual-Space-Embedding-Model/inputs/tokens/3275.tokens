background the role of diet in renal cell carcinoma risk has been inconclusivethis study uses an integrative approach to assess the role of food groups and food items in renal cell carcinoma riskdesign a casecontrol study was conducted from 20032006subjectssetting incident cases n335 were identified from hospital records and the florida cancer registry and population controls n337 frequency matched by age 5 years sex and race were identified through randomdigit dialingeating habits were assessed through the use of the 70item block food frequency questionnairestatistical analyses odds ratios ors 95 confidence intervals cis and tests for trends were calculated using logistic regression controlled for age sex race income body mass index and packyears of smokingresults decreased renal cell carcinoma risk was observed among the total sample and for men for vegetable consumption all subjects or 056 95 ci 035 088 men or 049 95 ci 025 096 but not for fruit consumptiontomato consumption decreased renal cell carcinoma risk for the total population and for men all subjects or 050 95 ci 031 081 men or 047 95 ci 024 095increased risk of renal cell carcinoma was observed among all subjects and among women with increased consumption of red meat all subjects or 443 95 ci 202 975 women or 304 95 ci 160 579white bread consumption increased renal cell carcinoma risk among women only or 305 95 ci 150 620 as did total dairy consumption or 236 95 ci 121 460conclusions the protective role of vegetables and the increased risk of renal cell carcinoma with meat consumption are supportedthe protective role of fruits is notnovel findings include the increased risk of renal cell carcinoma with white bread and white potato consumption and the decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma with tomato consumption
