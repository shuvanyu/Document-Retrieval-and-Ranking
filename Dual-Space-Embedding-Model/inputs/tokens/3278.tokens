background sleep quality is thought to be an important predictor of immunity and in turn susceptibility to the common coldthis article examines whether sleep duration and efficiency in the weeks preceding viral exposure are associated with cold susceptibilitymethods participants were 153 healthy men and women volunteers ages 2155for 14 consecutive days they reported their sleep duration and sleep efficiency percent of time in bed actually asleep for the previous night and whether they felt restedaverage scores for each sleep variable were calculated over the 14day baselinesubsequently participants were administered nasal drops containing a rhinovirus quarantined and monitored on the day before and for five days following exposure for development of a clinical cold infection in the presence of objective signs of illnessresults there was a graded association with average sleep duration with those with 7 hours sleep 294 times ci95118730 more likely to develop a cold than those with  8 hoursthe association with sleep efficiency was also graded with those with  92 efficiency 550 times ci952081448 more likely to develop a cold than those with efficiencies 98these relations could not be explained by differences in prechallenge virusspecific antibody demographics season of the year body mass socioeconomic status psychological variables or health practicespercent of days feeling rested was not associated with coldsconclusions poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration in the weeks preceding an exposure to a rhinovirus were associated with lower resistance to illness
