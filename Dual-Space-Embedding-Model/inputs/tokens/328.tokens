background the widespread use of organophosphorus op pesticides has led to frequent exposure in adults and childrenbecause such exposure may cause adverse health effects particularly in children the sources and patterns of exposure need to be studied furtherobjectives we assessed young urbansuburban childrens longitudinal exposure to op pesticides in the childrens pesticide exposure study cpes conducted in the greater seattle washington area and used a novel study design that allowed us to determine the contribution of dietary intake to the overall op pesticide exposuremethods twentythree children 311 years of age who consumed only conventional diets were recruited for this 1year study conducted in 20032004children switched to organic diets for 5 consecutive days in the summer and fall sampling seasonswe measured specific urinary metabolites for malathion chlorpyrifos and other op pesticides in urine samples collected twice daily for a period of 7 12 or 15 consecutive days during each of the four seasonsresults by substituting organic fresh fruits and vegetables for corresponding conventional food items the median urinary metabolite concentrations were reduced to nondetected or close to nondetected levels for malathion and chlorpyrifos at the end of the 5day organic diet intervention period in both summer and fall seasonswe also observed a seasonal effect on the op urinary metabolite concentrations and this seasonality corresponds to the consumption of fresh produce throughout the yearconclusions the findings from this study demonstrate that dietary intake of op pesticides represents the major source of exposure in young children
