we evaluated longterm use of mobile phones and the risk for brain tumours in casecontrol studies published so far on this issuewe identified ten studies on glioma and metaanalysis yielded or  09 95 ci  0811latency period of  or 10years gave or  12 95 ci  0819 based on six studies for ipsilateral use same side as tumour or  20 95 ci  1234 four studies but contralateral use did not increase the risk significantly or  11 95 ci  0620metaanalysis of nine studies on acoustic neuroma gave or  09 95 ci  0711 increasing to or  13 95 ci  0628 using  or 10years latency period four studiesipsilateral use gave or  24 95 ci  1153 and contralateral or  12 95 ci  0722 in the  or 10years latency period group three studiesseven studies gave results for meningioma yielding overall or  08 95 ci  07099using  or 10years latency period or  13 95 ci  0918 was calculated four studies increasing to or  17 95 ci  09931 for ipsilateral use and or  10 95 ci  0331 for contralateral use two studieswe conclude that this metaanalysis gave a consistent pattern of an association between mobile phone use and ipsilateral glioma and acoustic neuroma using  or 10years latency period
