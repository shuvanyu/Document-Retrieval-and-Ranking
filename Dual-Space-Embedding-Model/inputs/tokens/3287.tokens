background studies suggest cardioprotective benefits of dark chocolate containing cocoaobjective this study examines the acute effects of solid dark chocolate and liquid cocoa intake on endothelial function and blood pressure in overweight adultsdesign randomized placebocontrolled singleblind crossover trial of 45 healthy adults mean age 53 y mean body mass index in kgm2 30in phase 1 subjects were randomly assigned to consume a solid dark chocolate bar containing 22 g cocoa powder or a cocoafree placebo bar containing 0 g cocoa powderin phase 2 subjects were randomly assigned to consume sugarfree cocoa containing 22 g cocoa powder sugared cocoa containing 22 g cocoa powder or a placebo containing 0 g cocoa powderresults solid dark chocolate and liquid cocoa ingestion improved endothelial function measured as flowmediated dilatation compared with placebo dark chocolate 43  34 compared with 18  33 p  0001 sugarfree and sugared cocoa 57  26 and 20  18 compared with 15  28 p  0001blood pressure decreased after the ingestion of dark chocolate and sugarfree cocoa compared with placebo dark chocolate systolic 32  58 mm hg compared with 27  66 mm hg p  0001 and diastolic 14  39 mm hg compared with 27  64 mm hg p  001 sugarfree cocoa systolic 21  70 mm hg compared with 32  56 mm hg p  0001 and diastolic 12  87 mm hg compared with 28  56 mm hg p  0014endothelial function improved significantly more with sugarfree than with regular cocoa 57  26 compared with 20  18 p  0001conclusions the acute ingestion of both solid dark chocolate and liquid cocoa improved endothelial function and lowered blood pressure in overweight adultssugar content may attenuate these effects and sugarfree preparations may augment them
