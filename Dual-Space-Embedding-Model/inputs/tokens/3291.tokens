the antigenotoxic effect of ocimum sanctum l extract was studied against the genotoxic effect induced by a synthetic progestin cyproterone acetate on human lymphocytes using chromosomal aberrations mitotic index sister chromatid exchanges and replication index as a parametersabout 30 microm of cyproterone acetate was treated with o sanctum l infusion at dosages of 1075 x 104 2125 x 104 and 315 x 104 gml of culture mediuma clear dosedependent decrease in the genotoxic damage of cyproterone acetate was observed suggesting a possible modulating role of the plant infusionthe results of the present study suggest that the plant infusion per se does not have genotoxic potential but can modulate the genotoxicity of cyproterone acetate on human lymphocytes in vitro
