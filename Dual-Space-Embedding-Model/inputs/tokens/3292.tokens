helicobacter pylori h pylori is one of the most widespread human pathogens and plays major roles in chronic gastritis and gastric cancercd74 of gastric epithelial cells has recently been identified as an adhesion molecule to urease in h pyloriin this study we found that cd74 is highly expressed in a constitutive manner in ncin87 human gastric carcinoma cells at both the protein and mrna levels as compared with hs738stint fetal gastric cellssubsequently a novel cellbased elisa able to rapidly screen the suppressive agents of cd74 expression was establishedncin87 cells were treated separately with 25 different food phytochemicals 4100 µm for 48 h and subjected to our novel assayfrom those results a citrus coumarin bergamottin was indicated to be the most promising compound with an lc50ic50 value greater than 71 followed by luteolin 54 nobiletin 53 and quercetin 51our findings suggest that these cd74 suppressants are unique candidates for preventing h pylori adhesion and subsequent infection with reasonable action mechanisms
