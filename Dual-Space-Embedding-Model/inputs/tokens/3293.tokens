epidemiological evidence suggests a role for tea catechins in reduction of chronic disease riskhowever stability of catechins under digestive conditions is poorly understoodthe objective of this study was to characterize the effect of common food additives on digestive recovery of tea catechinsgreen tea water extracts were formulated in beverages providing 45 18 23 and 35 mg per 100 ml epicatechin ec epigallocatechin egc epigallocatechingallate egcg and epicatechingallate ecg respectivelycommon commercial beverage additives citric acid ca bht edta ascorbic acid aa milk bovine soy and rice and citrus juice orange grapefruit lemon and lime were formulated into finished tea beverages at incremental dosagessamples were then subjected to in vitro digestion simulating gastric and small intestinal conditions with pre and postdigestion catechin profiles assessed by hplccatechin stability in green tea was poor with 20 total catechins remaining postdigestionegc and egcg were most sensitive with less not double equals 10 recoveryteas formulated with 50 bovine soy and rice milk increased total catechin recovery significantly to 52 55 and 69 respectivelyincluding 30 mg aa in 250 ml of tea beverage significantly p005 increased catechin recovery of egc egcg ec and ecg to 74 54 82 and 45 respectivelyjuice preparation resulted in the highest recovery of any formulation for egc 8198 egcg 5676 ec 8695 and ecg 3055these data provide evidence that tea consumption practices and formulation factors likely impact catechin digestive recovery and may result in diverse physiological profiles
