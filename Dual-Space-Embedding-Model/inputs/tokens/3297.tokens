tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world after watertea is known to be a rich source of flavonoid antioxidantshowever tea also contains a unique amino acid ltheanine that may modulate aspects of brain function in humansevidence from human electroencephalograph eeg studies show that it has a direct effect on the brain juneja et altrends in food science  tech 199910199204ltheanine significantly increases activity in the alpha frequency band which indicates that it relaxes the mind without inducing drowsinesshowever this effect has only been established at higher doses than that typically found in a cup of black tea approximately 20mgthe aim of the current research was to establish this effect at more realistic dietary levelseeg was measured in healthy young participants at baseline and 45 60 75 90 and 105 minutes after ingestion of 50mg ltheanine n16 or placebo n19participants were resting with their eyes closed during eeg recordingthere was a greater increase in alpha activity across time in the ltheanine condition relative to placebo p005a second study replicated this effect in participants engaged in passive activitythese data indicate that ltheanine at realistic dietary levels has a significant effect on the general state of mental alertness or arousalfurthermore alpha activity is known to play an important role in critical aspects of attention and further research is therefore focussed on understanding the effect of ltheanine on attentional processes
