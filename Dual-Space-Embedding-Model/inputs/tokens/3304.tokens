various mechanisms by which sucrose could influence behavior are reviewedfirstly there is food intolerancethere are dozens of foods to which an adverse reaction has been demonstrated although a reaction to sucrose is less frequent than many other foodsa second possible mechanism is hypoglycemiathere is evidence that a tendency to develop low blood glucose levels but higher than those that can be described clinically as hypoglycemic is associated with irritability and violencehowever sucrose is not the predominant cause of swings in blood glucose levelsthirdly the role of sucrose intake on micronutrient status has been considered as studies have found that micronutrient supplementation decreased antisocial behaviormicronutrient intake is more closely associated with the total energy rather than sucrose intake typically the amount of sucrose in the diet does not lead to micronutrient deficiencyin fact metaanalysis of well designed studies that have examined the impact of sucrose on the behavior of children produced no evidence that it has an adverse influence
