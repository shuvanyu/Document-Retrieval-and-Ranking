to find out if the cancer protective effects of brussels sprouts seen in epidemiological studies are due to protection against dnadamage an intervention trial was conducted in which the impact of vegetable consumption on dnastability was monitored in lymphocytes with the comet assayafter consumption of the sprouts 300 gpd n  8 a reduction of dnamigration 97 induced by the heterocyclic aromatic amine 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip was observed whereas no effect was seen with 3amino1methyl5hpyrido43bindole trpp2this effect protection may be due to inhibition of sulfotransferase 1a1 which plays a key role in the activation of phipin addition a decrease of the endogenous formation of oxidized bases was observed and dnadamage caused by hydrogen peroxide was significantly 39 lower after the interventionthese effects could not be explained by induction of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase but in vitro experiments indicate that sprouts contain compounds which act as direct scavengers of reactive oxygen speciesserum vitamin c levels were increased by 37 after sprout consumption but no correlations were seen between prevention of dnadamage and individual alterations of the vitamin levelsour study shows for the first time that sprout consumption leads to inhibition of sulfotransferases in humans and to protection against phip and oxidative dnadamage
