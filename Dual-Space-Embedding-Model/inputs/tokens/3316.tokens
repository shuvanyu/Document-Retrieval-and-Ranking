almond prunus dulcismilldawebb skins have been proposed as a source of bioactive polyphenolsin this article the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of almond skins obtained from different processes blanching freezedrying blanching  drying and roasting were studieda total of 31 phenolic compounds corresponding to flavan3ols 33 to 56 of the total of phenolic compounds identified flavonol glycosides 9 to 36 hydroxybenzoic acids and aldehydes 6 to 26 flavonol aglycones 17 to 18 flavanone glycosides 3 to 77 flavanone aglycones 069 to 54 hydroxycinnamic acids 065 to 26 and dihydroflavonol aglycones 0 to 28 were determined in the skins from 3 different varieties of almondsthe total contents of phenolic compounds identified were significantly p  005 higher around 2fold in the roasted samples than in the blanched almonds freezedriedindustrial drying oven drying of the blanched almond skins produced an increase  2fold in the contents of phenolic compounds although the results were only statistically significant p  005 for some samplesthe antioxidant activity orac values was higher for the roasted samples 0803 to 108 mmol troloxg followed by the samples subjected to blanching  drying 0398 to 0575 mmol troloxg and then the blanched freezedried samples 0331 to 0451 mmol troloxgroasting is the most suitable type of industrial processing of almonds to obtain almond skin extracts with the greatest antioxidant capacity
