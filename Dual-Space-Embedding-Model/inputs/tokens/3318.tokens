the isothiocyanate sulforaphane has been implicated in the cancerprotective effects of brassica vegetableswhen broccoli is consumed sulforaphane is released from hydrolysis of glucoraphanin by plant myrosinase andor colonic microbiotathe influence of meal composition and broccolicooking duration on isothiocyanate uptake was investigated in a designed experimentvolunteers n 12 were each offered a meal with or without beef together with 150 g lightly cooked broccoli microwaved 20 min or fully cooked broccoli microwaved 55 min or a broccoli seed extractthey received 3 g mustard containing preformed allyl isothiocyanate aitc with each mealurinary output of allyl ama and sulforaphane sfma mercapturic acids the biomarkers of production of aitc and sulforaphane respectively were measured for 24 h after meal consumptionthe estimated yield of sulforaphane in vivo was about 3fold higher after consumption of lightly cooked broccoli than fully cooked broccoliabsorption of aitc from mustard was about 13fold higher following consumption of the meatcontaining meal compared with the non meatcontaining alternativethe meal matrix did not significantly influence the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin and its excretion as sfma from broccoliisothiocyanates may interact with the meal matrix to a greater extent if they are ingested preformed rather than after their production from hydrolysis of glucosinolates in vivothe main influence on the production of isothiocyanates in vivo is the way in which brassica vegetables are cooked rather than the effect of the meal matrix
