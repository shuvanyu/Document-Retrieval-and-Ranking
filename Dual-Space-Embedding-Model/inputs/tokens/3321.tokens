in this study solid fermentation of steamed black soybean with various gras generally recognized as safe filamentiousfungi including aspergillus awamori aspergillus oryzae bcrc 30222 aspergillus sojae bcrc 30103 rhizopus azygosporus bcrc 31158 and rhizopus spno2 was performedmutagenicity and antimutagenicity of the methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans against 4nitroquinolinenoxide 4nqo a direct mutagen and benzoapyrene bap an indirect mutagen on salmonella typhimurium ta100 and ta 98 were examinedthe methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans show no mutagenic activity for either test strains at the doses testedthe extracts inhibited mutagenesis by either 4nqo or bap in s typhimurium ta100 and ta98fermentation with fungi also enhanced the antimutagenic effect of black soybean while the antimutagenic effect of the fermented black soybeans extract varied with the starter organism mutagen and test strain of s typhimurium examinedgenerally the extracts of a awamorifermented black soybean exhibited the highest antimutagenic effectwith strain ta100 the inhibitory effects of 50 mg of a awamorifermented black soybean extract per plate on the mutagenic effects of 4nqo and bap were 92 and 89 respectively while the corresponding rates for extract of unfermented were 41 and 63 respectivelywith strain 98 the inhibition rates were 94 and 81 for the fermented bean extract and 58 and 44 for the unfermented bean extractstesting of extracts prepared from black soybean by a awamori at temperatures 25 30 and 35 degrees c and for times of 15 days revealed that generally the extract prepared from beans fermented at 30 degrees c for 3 days exhibited the greatest inhibition against the mutagenic effects of 4nqo and bap
