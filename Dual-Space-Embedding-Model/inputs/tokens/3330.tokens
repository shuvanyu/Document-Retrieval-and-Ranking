acrylamide a probable human carcinogen is formed in several foods during hightemperature processingso far epidemiological studies have not shown any association between human cancer risk and dietary exposure to acrylamidethe purpose of this study was to conduct a nested case control study within a prospective cohort study on the association between breast cancer and exposure to acrylamide using biomarkersnterminal hemoglobin adduct levels of acrylamide and its genotoxic metabolite glycidamide in red blood cells were analyzed by lcmsms as biomarkers of exposure on 374 breast cancer cases and 374 controls from a cohort of postmenopausal womenthe adduct levels of acrylamide and glycidamide were similar in cases and controls with smokers having much higher levels approximately 3 times than nonsmokersno association was seen between acrylamidehemoglobin levels and breast cancer risk neither unadjusted nor adjusted for the potential confounders hrt duration parity bmi alcohol intake and educationafter adjustment for smoking behavior however a positive association was seen between acrylamidehemoglobin levels and estrogen receptor positive breast cancer with an estimated incidence rate ratio 95 ci of 27 1166 per 10fold increase in acrylamidehemoglobin levela weak association between glycidamide hemoglobin levels and incidence of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer was also found this association however entirely disappeared when acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin levels were mutually adjustedc 2008 wileyliss inc
