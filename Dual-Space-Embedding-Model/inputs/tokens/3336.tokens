background there are few studies reporting on docosahexaenoic acid dha 226n3 supplementation during pregnancy and infant cognitive functiondha supplementation in pregnancy and infant problem solving in the first year have not been investigatedobjective we tested the hypothesis that infants born to women who consumed a dhacontaining functional food during pregnancy would demonstrate better problemsolving abilities and recognition memory than would infants born to women who consumed the placebo during pregnancydesign in a doubleblind placebocontrolled randomized trial pregnant women consumed a dhacontaining functional food or a placebo from gestation week 24 until deliverystudy groups received dhacontaining cerealbased bars 300 mg dha92kcal bar average consumption 5 barswk n  14 or cerealbased placebo bars n  15the infant planning test and fagan test of infant intelligence were administered to infants at age 9 mothe problemsolving trial included a support step and a search stepthe procedure was scored on the basis of the infants performance on each step and on the entire problem intention score and total intentional solutionsscores were generated on the basis of the cumulative performance of the infant on 5 trialsresults treatment had significant effects on the performance of problemsolving tasks total intention score p  0017 total intentional solutions p  0011 and number of intentional solutions on both cloth p  0008 and cover p  0004 stepsthere were no significant differences between groups in any measure of fagan test of infant intelligenceconclusion these data point to a benefit for problem solving but not for recognition memory at age 9 mo in infants of mothers who consumed a dhacontaining functional food during pregnancy
