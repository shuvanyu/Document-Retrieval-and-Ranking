backgroundaims the objective of the study was to collect data on dietary fat intake of omnivores vegetarians vegans and semiomnivores as well as its impact on n3 and n6 fatty acids in longterm markers such as sphingolipids phosphatidylcholine pc phosphatidylserine ps phosphatidylethanolamine pe as well as the calculated sphingo and phospholipids spl of erythrocytesmethod the present observational study included 98 austrian adult volunteers of both genders of which 23 were omnivores 25 vegetarians 37 vegans and 13 semiomnivoresinformation on anthropometry using measured body weight and height was obtainedthe amount and composition of ingested fat were calculated from 24hour recalls and the fatty acid pattern in the phospholipids was assessed using gas chromatographyresults the unbalanced n6n3 ratio and the limited dietary sources of eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha in vegans and vegetarians led to reductions in c205n3 c225n3 c226n3 and total n3 fatty acids in spl pc ps and pe compared with omnivores and semiomnivoresthe total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids remained unchangedconclusion the vegetarian diet with an average n6n3 ratio of 101 promotes biochemical n3 tissue declineto ensure physical mental and neurological health vegetarians have to reduce the n6n3 ratio with an additional intake of direct sources of epa and dha regardless of age and genderc 2008 s karger ag basel
