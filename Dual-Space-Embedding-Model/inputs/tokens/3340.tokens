purpose of review to summarize recent evidence regarding associations of early life exposure to mercury from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy thimerosal in vaccines and dental amalgam with child neurodevelopmentrecent findings recent publications have built upon previous evidence demonstrating mild detrimental neurocognitive effects from prenatal methylmercury exposure from maternal fish consumption during pregnancynew studies examining the effects of prenatal fish consumption as well as methylmercury suggest there are benefits from prenatal fish consumption but also that consumption of fish high in mercury should be avoidedfuture studies incorporating information on both the methylmercury and the docosahexaenoic acid contained within fish will help to refine recommendations to optimize outcomes for mothers and childrenadditional recent studies have supported the safety of vaccines containing thimerosal and of dental amalgam for repair of dental caries in childrensummary exposure to mercury may harm child developmentinterventions intended to reduce exposure to low levels of mercury in early life must however be carefully evaluated in consideration of the potential attendant harm from resultant behavior changes such as reduced docosahexaenoic acid exposure from lower seafood intake reduced uptake of childhood vaccinations and suboptimal dental care
