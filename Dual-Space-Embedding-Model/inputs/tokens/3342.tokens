there is controversy about the risks and benefits of consuming fishfish consumption provides nutrients some of which are essential for brain growth and developmentall fish however contain methyl mercury mehg a known neurotoxicantthe toxic effect of mehg seems most damaging during brain development and thus prenatal exposure is of greatest concernat present the level of prenatal exposure associated with risk to a childs neurodevelopment is not knownbalancing the rewards and possible risks of fish consumption presents a dilemma to consumers and regulatory authoritieswe review the nutrients in fish that are important in brain development and the current evidence of risk from mehg at exposure levels achieved by consuming fishwe then review the findings from a large prospective cohort study of a population that consumes fish daily the seychelles child development studythe mehg content of the fish consumed in the seychelles is similar to that of ocean fish available in industrialized countries so they represent a sentinel population for any risk from fish consumptionin the seychelles evaluations of the children through 9 y of age show no consistent pattern of adverse associations with prenatal mehg exposurerecent studies in the seychelles have focused on nutrients in fish that might influence a childs development including longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids iodine iron and cholinepreliminary findings from this study suggest that the beneficial influence of nutrients from fish may counter any adverse effects of mehg on the developing nervous system
