the objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of 2 levels of raw milk somatic cell count scc on the composition of prato cheese and on the microbiological and sensory changes of prato cheese throughout ripeningtwo groups of dairy cows were selected to obtain lowscc 200000 cellsml and highscc 700000 cellsml milks which were used to manufacture 2 vats of cheesethe pasteurized milk was evaluated according to the ph total solids fat total protein lactose standard plate count coliforms at 45 degrees c and salmonella sppthe cheese composition was evaluated 2 d after manufacturelactic acid bacteria psychrotrophic bacteria and yeast and mold counts were carried out after 3 9 16 32 and 51 d of storagesalmonella spp listeria monocytogenes and coagulasepositive staphylococcus counts were carried out after 3 32 and 51 d of storagea 2 x 5 factorial design with 4 replications was performedsensory evaluation of the cheeses from low and highscc milks was carried out for overall acceptance by using a 9point hedonic scale after 8 22 35 50 and 63 d of storagethe somatic cell levels used did not affect the total protein and saltmoisture contents of the cheesesthe ph and moisture content were higher and the clotting time was longer for cheeses from highscc milkboth cheeses presented the absence of salmonella sppand l monocytogenes and the coagulasepositive staphylococcus count was below 1 x 102 cfug throughout the storage timethe lactic acid bacteria count decreased significantly during the storage time for the cheeses from both low and highscc milks but at a faster rate for the cheese from highscc milkcheeses from highscc milk presented lower psychrotrophic bacteria counts and higher yeast and mold counts than cheeses from lowscc milkcheeses from lowscc milk showed better overall acceptance by the consumersthe lower overall acceptance of the cheeses from highscc milk may be associated with texture and flavor defects probably caused by the higher proteolysis of these cheeses
