this casecontrol study examined different food groups in relation to breast cancerbetween 2002 and 2004 437 cases and 922 controls matched according to age and area of residence were intervieweddiet was measured by a validated food frequency questionnaireadjusted odds ratios ors were computed across levels of various dietary intakes identified by two methods the classical and the spline methodsneither of the 2 methods found an association between total fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancerresults of the 2 methods showed a nonsignificant decreased association with cooked vegetables intake as well as legumes and fish consumptionwhereas the spline method showed no association the classical method showed significant associations related to the lowest consumption of raw vegetables or dairy products and breast cancer risk adjusted or for raw vegetable consumption between 674 and 1013 gday vs  674 gday was 063 95 confidence interval ci  043093adjusted or for dairy consumption between 1343 and 2712 gday vs  1343 gday was 157 95 ci  106232however the overall results were not consistentcompared to the classical method the use of the spline method showed a significant association for cereal meat and olive oilcereal and olive oil were inversely associated with breast cancer riskbreast cancer risk increased by 56 for each additional 100 gday of meat consumptionstudies using novel methodological techniques are needed to confirm the dietary threshold responsible for changes in breast cancer risknew approaches that consist in analyzing dietary patterns rather than dietary food are necessary
