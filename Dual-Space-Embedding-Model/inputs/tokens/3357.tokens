the potential health benefits of soyderived phytoestrogens include their reported utility as anticarcinogens cardioprotectants and as hormone replacement alternatives in menopausealthough there is increasing popularity of dietary phytoestrogen supplementation and of vegetarian and vegan diets among adolescents and adults concerns about potential detrimental or other genotoxic effects persistwhile a variety of genotoxic effects of phytoestrogens have been reported in vitro the concentrations at which such effects occurred were often much higher than the physiologically relevant doses achievable by dietary or pharmacologic intake of soy foods or supplementsthis review focuses on in vitro studies of the most abundant soy phytoestrogen genistein critically examining dose as a crucial determinant of cellular effectsin consideration of levels of dietary genistein uptake and bioavailability we have defined in vitro concentrations of genistein 5 microm as nonphysiological and thus high doses in contrast to much of the previous literaturein doing so many of the oftencited genotoxic effects of genistein including apoptosis cell growth inhibition topoisomerase inhibition and others become less obviousrecent cellular epigenetic and microarray studies are beginning to decipher genistein effects that occur at dietarily relevant low concentrationsin toxicology the well accepted principle of the dose defines the poison applies to many toxicants and can be invoked as herein to distinguish genotoxic versus potentially beneficial in vitro effects of natural dietary products such as genistein
