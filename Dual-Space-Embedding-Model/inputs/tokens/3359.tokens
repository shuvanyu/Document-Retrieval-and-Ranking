purpose because they have large variations in consumption asian countries are suitable settings for studies of the effect of relatively highdose isoflavone intake on breast cancer risknevertheless no prospective study from asia has assessed blood or urine levels as biomarkers of isoflavone intakepatients and methods a total of 24226 women ages 40 to 69 years in the japan public health centerbased prospective study who responded to the baseline questionnaire and provided blood in 1990 to 1995 were observed to december 2002during a mean 106 years of followup 144 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer were identifiedtwo matched controls for each patient were selected from the cohortisoflavone levels were assessed by plasma level and food frequency questionnaire and the odds ratio of breast cancer according to isoflavone level was estimated using a conditional logistic regression modelresults we found a statistically significant inverse association between plasma genistein and risk of breast cancer but no association for plasma daidzeinadjusted odds ratios for the highest versus lowest quartile of plasma level were 034 for genistein 95 ci 016 to 074 p for trend 02 and 071 for daidzein 95 ci 035 to 144 p for trend 54median plasma genistein values in the control group were 319 ngml for the lowest and 3539 ngml for the highest quartile groupsregarding dietary intake of isoflavones nonsignificant inverse associations were observed for both genistein and daidzeinconclusion this nested casecontrol study found an inverse association between plasma genistein and the risk of breast cancer in japan
