the effects of extracts from five cultivars of strawberries on the proliferation of colon cancer cells ht29 and breast cancer cells mcf7 were investigated and possible correlations with the levels of several antioxidants were analyzedin addition the effects of organic cultivation compared to conventional cultivation on the content of antioxidants in the strawberries and strawberry extracts on the cancer cell proliferation were investigatedthe ratio of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate was significantly higher in the organically cultivated strawberriesthe strawberry extracts decreased the proliferation of both ht29 cells and mcf7 cells in a dosedependent waythe inhibitory effect for the highest concentration of the extracts was in the range of 4163 average 53 inhibition compared to controls for the ht29 cells and 2656 average 43 for mcf7 cellsthe extracts from organically grown strawberries had a higher antiproliferative activity for both cell types at the highest concentration than the conventionally grown and this might indicate a higher content of secondary metabolites with anticarcinogenic properties in the organically grown strawberriesfor ht29 cells there was a negative correlation at the highest extract concentration between the content of ascorbate or vitamin c and cancer cell proliferation whereas for mcf7 cells a high ratio of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate correlated with a higher inhibition of cell proliferation at the second highest concentrationthe significance of the effect of ascorbate on cancer cell proliferation might lie in a synergistic action with other compounds
