human gammadeltat lymphocytes are a subset of t cells and are a first line of defense against microbes and tumorsthese gammadeltat cells can be primed by nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates and certain shortchain alkylaminesthese primed gammadeltat cells have an enhanced capacity to proliferate and to secrete cytokines upon ex vivo exposure to a wide variety of microbes and tumor cellsthe largest dietary source of alkylamines is ltheanine an amino acid unique to tea beverages that is catabolized to ethylaminesupplementation of subjects with capsules containing ltheanine and catechins has recently been shown to decrease the incidence of cold and flu symptoms while enhancing gammadeltat cell function
