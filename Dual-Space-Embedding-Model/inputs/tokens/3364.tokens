the present paper explores the level of evidence required to justify giving dietary advice to the publicthere are important practical differences between the development of public health nutrition guidelines and guidelines for clinical practicewhile the gold standard for evidence for clinical practice guidelines is a metaanalysis of a number of randomised controlled trials this is often unrealistic and sometimes unethical for the evaluation of public health nutrition interventionshence epidemiological studies make up the bulk of evidence for nutrition guidelinestea and coffee are an interesting case study in relation to this issuethey are two of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide yet there is little dietary advice on their usethe evidence for a relationship between coffee or tea consumption and several diseases is discussedthe available studies predominantly epidemiological together with animal and in vitro studies indicate that coffee and tea are both safe beverageshowever tea is the healthier option because it has a possible role in the prevention of several cancers and cvdwhile the evidence for such relationships is not strong the public will continue to drink both tea and coffee and will continue to ask nutritionists to make recommendationsit is therefore argued that advice should be given on the best available data as waiting for complete data to become available could have severe consequences for public health
