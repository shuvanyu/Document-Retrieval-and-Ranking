uv radiation uvr is a complete carcinogen that elicits a constellation of pathological events including direct dna damage generation of reactive oxidants that peroxidize lipids and damage other cellular components initiation of inflammation and suppression of the immune responserecent dramatic increases in the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers are largely attributable to higher exposure of an aging population to uvrtherefore the development of cellular strategies for intrinsic protection of the skin against the deleterious effects of uvr is imperativehere we show that erythema resulting from uvr is a comprehensive and noninvasive biomarker for assessing uvr damage and can be precisely and easily quantified in human skintopical application of sulforaphanerich extracts of 3dayold broccoli sprouts upregulated phase 2 enzymes in the mouse and human skin protected against uvrinduced inflammation and edema in mice and reduced susceptibility to erythema arising from narrowband 311nm uvr in humansin six human subjects three males and three females 2853 years of age the mean reduction in erythema across six doses of uvr 300800 mjcm2 in 100 mjcm2 increments was 377 range 837781 p  0025this protection against a carcinogen in humans is catalytic and long lasting
