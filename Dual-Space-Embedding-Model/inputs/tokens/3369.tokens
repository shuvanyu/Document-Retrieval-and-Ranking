background elevated total homocysteine thcy concentrations have been associated with cognitive impairment but it is unclear whether low vitamin b12 or folate status is responsible for cognitive declineobjective we examined the associations of cognitive decline with vitamin b12 and folate status in a longitudinal cohort study performed from 1993 to 2003 in oxford united kingdomdesign cognitive function was assessed with the minimental state examination on 3 occasions during 10 y and related to serum concentrations of vitamin b12 holotranscobalamin holotc thcy methylmalonic acid mma and folate with the use of linear mixed models in 1648 participants who provided blood in 1995results cognitive function declined abruptly at younger ages in some participants but remained intact in others until very old agein multivariate regression analyses after adjustment for established risk factors concentrations of holotc a marker of reduced vitamin b12 status thcy and mma predicted cognitive decline but folate did nota doubling in holotc concentrations from 50 to 100 pmoll was associated with a 30 slower rate of cognitive decline 0137 to 0083 whereas a doubling in thcy from 10 to 20 micromoll or mma from 025 to 050 micromoll was associated with 50 more rapid cognitive decline 0090 to 0169 and 0104 to 0169 respectivelyafter adjustment for all vitamin markers simultaneously the associations of cognitive decline with holotc and mma remained significantconclusions low vitamin b12 status was associated with more rapid cognitive declinerandomized trials are required to determine the relevance of vitamin b12 supplementation for prevention of dementia
