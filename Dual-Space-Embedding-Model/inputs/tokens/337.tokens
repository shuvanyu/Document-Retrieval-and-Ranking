demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers perceptions that they are more nutritioushowever scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional differences between organic and nonorganic foods and two recent reviews have concluded that there are no differencesin the present study we carried out metaanalyses based on 343 peerreviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and nonorganic cropscropbased foodsmost importantly the concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially higher in organic cropscropbased foods with those of phenolic acids flavanones stilbenes flavones flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 95  ci 5 33  69 95  ci 13 125  28 95  ci 12 44  26 95  ci 3 48  50 95  ci 28 72  and 51 95  ci 17 86  higher respectivelymany of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases including cvd and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers in dietary intervention and epidemiological studiesadditionally the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops which also contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal cdsignificant differences were also detected for some other egminerals and vitamins compoundsthere is evidence that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower cd concentrations are linked to specific agronomic practices egnonuse of mineral n and p fertilisers respectively prescribed in organic farming systemsin conclusion organic crops on average have higher concentrations of antioxidants lower concentrations of cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than the nonorganic comparators across regions and production seasons
