a singledose ingestion of flavanolrich cocoa acutely reverses endothelial dysfunctionto investigate the time course of endothelial function during daily consumption of highflavanol cocoa we determined flowmediated dilation fmd acutely for up to 6 hours after singledose ingestion and chronically administration for 7 daysthe study population represented individuals with smokingrelated endothelial dysfunction in addition to fmd plasma nitrite and nitrate were measuredthe daily consumption of a flavanolrich cocoa drink 3 x 306 mg flavanolsd over 7 days n6 resulted in continual fmd increases at baseline after overnight fast and before flavanol ingestion and in sustained fmd augmentation at 2 hours after ingestionfasted fmd responses increased from 37  04 on day 1 to 52  06 61  06 and 66  05 each p  005 on days 3 5 and 8 respectivelyfmd returned to 33  03 after a washout week of cocoafree diet day 15increases observed in circulating nitrite but not in circulating nitrate paralleled the observed fmd augmentationsthe acute singledose consumption of cocoa drinks with 28 to 918 mg of flavanols led to dosedependent increases in fmd and nitrite with a maximal fmd at 2 hours after consumptionthe dose to achieve a halfmaximal fmd response was 616 mg n6generally applied biomarkers for oxidative stress plasma mda teac and antioxidant status plasma ascorbate urate remained unaffected by cocoa flavanol ingestionthe daily consumption of flavanolrich cocoa has the potential to reverse endothelial dysfunction in a sustained and dosedependent manner
