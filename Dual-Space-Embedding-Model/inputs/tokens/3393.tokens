objectives strong evidence has secured aging as a powerful predictor of both cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction yet specific treatment is not availablewe tested the hypothesis that vascular responsiveness to flavanolrich cocoa increases with advancing agewe have previously shown that flavanolrich cocoa induced peripheral vasodilation improving endothelial function via a nitric oxide nodependent mechanismmethods we studied blood pressure and peripheral arterial responses to several days of cocoa in 15 young  50 years and 19 older  50 healthy subjectsresults the nitric oxide synthase nos inhibitor nomeganitrolargininemethylester lname induced significant pressor responses following cocoa administration only among the older subjects systolic blood pressure sbp rose 13  4 mmhg diastolic blood pressure dbp 6  2 mmhg p  0008 and 0047 respectively sbp was significantly higher in the older subjects p  005flowmediated vasodilation measured by tonometry in the finger was enhanced with flavanolrich cocoa in both groups but significantly more so among the old p  001finally basal pulse wave amplitude pwa followed a similar patternfour to six days of flavanolrich cocoa caused a rise in pwa in both groupsat peak vasodilation following acute cocoa intake on the final day both groups showed a further significant rise in pwathe response in the older subjects was more robust p  005lname significantly reversed dilation in both groupsconclusions flavanolrich cocoa enhanced several measures of endothelial function to a greater degree among older than younger healthy subjectsour data suggest that the nodependent vascular effects of flavanolrich cocoa may be greater among older people in whom endothelial function is more disturbed
