objective the relationship between lipid profiles and alzheimer disease ad pathology at the population level is unclearwe searched for evidence of adrelated pathologic risk of abnormal lipid metabolismmethods this study included brain specimens from a series of 147 autopsies performed between 1998 and 2003 of residents in hisayama town japan 76 men and 71 women who underwent clinical examinations in 1988lipid profiles such as total cholesterol tc triglycerides and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc were measured in 1988lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc was calculated using the friedewald formulaneuritic plaques nps were assessed according to the consortium to establish a registry for alzheimers disease guidelines cerad and neurofibrillary tangles nfts were assessed according to braak stageassociations between each lipid profile and ad pathology were examined by analysis of covariance and logistic regression analysesresults adjusted means of tc ldlc tchdlc ldlchdlc and nonhdlc defined as tchdlc were significantly higher in subjects with nps even in sparse to moderate stages cerad  1 or 2 compared to subjects without nps in multivariate models including apoe Îµ4 carrier and other confounding factorsthe subjects in the highest quartiles of these lipid profiles had significantly higher risks of nps compared to subjects in the lower respective quartiles which may suggest a threshold effectconversely there was no relationship between any lipid profile and nftsconclusion the results of this study suggest that dyslipidemia increases the risk of plaquetype pathology
