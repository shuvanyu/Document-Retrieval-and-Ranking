endogenous sulfite is generated as a consequence of the bodys normal processing of sulfurcontaining amino acidssulfites occur as a consequence of fermentation and also occur naturally in a number of foods and beveragesas food additives sulfiting agents were first used in 1664 and approved in the united states as long ago as the 1800swith such long experience with their use it is easy to understand why these substances have been regarded as safethey are currently used for a variety of preservative properties including controlling microbial growth preventing browning and spoilage and bleaching some foodsit is estimated that up to 500000  05 of the population sulfitesensitive individuals live in the united statessulfite sensitivity occurs most often in asthmatic adultspredominantly women it is uncommonly reported in preschool childrenadverse reactions to sulfites in nonasthmatics are extremely rareasthmatics who are steroiddependent or who have a higher degree of airway hyperreactivity may be at greater risk of experiencing a reaction to sulfitecontaining foodseven within this limited population sulfite sensitivity reactions vary widely ranging from no reaction to severethe majority of reactions are mildthese manifestations may include dermatologic respiratory or gastrointestinal signs and symptomssevere nonspecific signs and symptoms occur less commonlybronchoconstriction is the most common sensitivity response in asthmaticsthe precise mechanisms of the sensitivity responses have not been completely elucidatedinhalation of sulfur dioxide so2 generated in the stomach following ingestion of sulfitecontaining foods or beverages a deficiency in a mitochondrial enzyme and an igemediated immune response have all been implicatedabstract truncated at 250 words
