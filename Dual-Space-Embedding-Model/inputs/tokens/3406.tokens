objective watermelon is a rich source of citrulline an amino acid that can be metabolized to arginine a conditionally essential amino acid for humansarginine is the nitrogenous substrate used in the synthesis of nitric oxide and plays an essential role in cardiovascular and immune functionsno detailed studies have been conducted to evaluate plasma arginine response in humans after longterm feeding of citrulline from natural plant sourcesthis study investigated if watermelon juice consumption increases fasting concentrations of plasma arginine ornithine and citrulline in healthy adult humansmethods subjects n  1223treatment consumed a controlled diet and 0 control 780 or 1560 g of watermelon juice per day for 3 wk in a crossover designthe treatments provided 1 and 2 g of citrulline per daytreatment periods were preceded by washout periods of 2 to 4 wkresults compared with the baseline fasting plasma arginine concentrations increased 12 after 3 wk of the lowerdose watermelon treatment arginine and ornithine concentrations increased 22 and 18 respectively after 3 wk of the higherdose watermelon treatmentfasting citrulline concentrations did not increase relative to the control but remained stable throughout the studyconclusion the increased fasting plasma concentrations of arginine and ornithine and stable concentrations of plasma citrulline in response to watermelon juice consumption indicated that the citrulline from this plant origin was effectively converted into argininethese results demonstrate that plasma concentration of arginine can be increased through intake of citrulline from watermelon
