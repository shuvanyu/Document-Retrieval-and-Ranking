objective to investigate the possible role of the maternal diet particularly vegetarianism and consumption of phytoestrogens in the origin of hypospadias which is reported to be increasing in prevalencesubjects and methods detailed information was obtained prospectively from mothers including previous obstetric history lifestyle and dietary practices using structured selfcompleted questionnaires during pregnancypreviously recognized associations with environmental and parental factors were examined focusing particularly on the hypothesized hormonal linkmultivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent associationsresults of 7928 boys born to mothers taking part in the avon longitudinal study of pregnancy and childhood 51 hypospadias cases were identifiedthere were no significant differences in the proportion of hypospadias cases among mothers who smoked consumed alcohol or for any aspect of their previous reproductive history including the number of previous pregnancies number of miscarriages use of the contraceptive pill time to conception and age at menarchesignificant differences were detected for some aspects of the maternal diet ievegetarianism and iron supplementation in the first half of pregnancymothers who were vegetarian in pregnancy had an adjusted odds ratio or of 499 95 confidence interval ci 2101188 of giving birth to a boy with hypospadias compared with omnivores who did not supplement their diet with ironomnivores who supplemented their diet with iron had an adjusted or of 207 95 ci 100432the only other statistically significant association for hypospadias was with influenza in the first 3 months of pregnancy adjusted or 319 95 ci 150678conclusion as vegetarians have a greater exposure to phytoestrogens than do omnivores these results support the possibility that phytoestrogens have a deleterious effect on the developing male reproductive system
