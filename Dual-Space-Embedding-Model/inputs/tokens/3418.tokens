lignans derived from flaxseed are phytooestrogens being increasingly studied for their health benefitsan 8week randomised doubleblind placebocontrolled study was conducted in fiftyfive hypercholesterolaemic subjects using treatments of 0 placebo 300 or 600 mgd of dietary secoisolariciresinol diglucoside sdg from flaxseed extract to determine the effect on plasma lipids and fasting glucose levelssignificant treatment effects were achieved p  005 to  0001 for the decrease of total cholesterol tc ldlcholesterol ldlc and glucose concentrations as well as their percentage decrease from baselineat weeks 6 and 8 in the 600 mg sdg group the decreases of tc and ldlc concentrations were in the range from 220 to 2438  respectively all p  0005 compared with placebofor the 300 mg sdg group only significant differences from baseline were observed for decreases of tc and ldlc a substantial effect on lowering concentrations of fasting plasma glucose was also noted in the 600 mg sdg group at weeks 6 and 8 especially in the subjects with baseline glucose concentrations  or  583 mmoll lowered 2556 and 2496  p  0015 and p  0012 compared with placebo respectivelyplasma concentrations of secoisolariciresinol seco enterodiol ed and enterolactone were all significantly raised in the groups supplemented with flaxseed lignanthe observed cholesterollowering values were correlated with the concentrations of plasma seco and ed r 01280302 p  005 to  0001in conclusion dietary flaxseed lignan extract decreased plasma cholesterol and glucose concentrations in a dosedependent manner
