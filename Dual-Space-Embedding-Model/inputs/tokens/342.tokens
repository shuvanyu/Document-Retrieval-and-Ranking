background and aims the causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis uc are unknowndietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ucthe aim of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an increased risk of relapse of ucmethods a prospective cohort study was performed with uc patients in remission recruited from two district general hospitals who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual diet on relapserelapse was defined using a validated disease activity indexnutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised into tertilesadjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using multivariate logistic regression controlling for nondietary factorsresults a total of 191 patients were recruited and 96 completed the studyfifty two per cent of patients relapsedconsumption of meat odds ratio or 32 95 confidence intervals ci 1378 particularly red and processed meat or 519 95 ci 21129 protein or 300 95 ci 125719 and alcohol or 271 95 ci 11667 in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intakehigh sulphur or 276 95 ci 11964 or sulphate or 26 95 ci 10863 intakes were also associated with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood of relapseconclusions potentially modifiable dietary factors such as a high meat or alcoholic beverage intake have been identified that are associated with an increased likelihood of relapse for uc patientsfurther studies are needed to determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse frequency
