there is some evidence that dietary factors may modify the risk of squamous cell carcinoma scc of the skin but the association between food intake and scc has not been evaluated prospectivelywe examined the association between food intake and scc incidence among 1056 randomly selected adults living in an australian subtropical communitymeasurementerror corrected estimates of intake in 15 food groups were defined from a validated food frequency questionnaire in 1992associations with scc risk were assessed using poisson and negative binomial regression to the persons affected and tumour counts respectively based on incident histologically confirmed tumours occurring between 1992 and 2002after multivariable adjustment none of the food groups was significantly associated with scc riskstratified analysis in participants with a past history of skin cancer showed a decreased risk of scc tumours for high intakes of green leafy vegetables rr  045 95 ci  022091 p for trend  002 and an increased risk for high intake of unmodified dairy products rr  253 95 ci 115554 p for trend  003food intake was not associated with scc risk in persons who had no past history of skin cancerthese findings suggest that consumption of green leafy vegetables may help prevent development of subsequent sccs of the skin among people with previous skin cancer and that consumption of unmodified dairy products such as whole milk cheese and yoghurt may increase scc risk in susceptible personscopyright 2006 wileyliss inc
