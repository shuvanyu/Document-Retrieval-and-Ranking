we evaluated the role of dietary nutrients in the etiology of endometrial cancer in a populationbased casecontrol study of 1204 newly diagnosed endometrial cancer cases and 1212 age frequencymatched controlsinformation on usual dietary habits was collected during an inperson interview using a validated quantitative food frequency questionnairelogistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of nutrients with endometrial cancer risk using an energy density method eg nutrient intake1000 kilocalories of intakehigher energy intake was associated with increased risk which was attributable to animal source energy and a high proportion of energy from protein and fatodds ratios comparing highest versus lowest quintiles of intake were elevated for intake of animal protein odds ratio or 5 20 95 confidential interval 1527 and fat or 5 15 1220 but reduced for plant sources of these nutrients or 5 07 0509 for protein and or 5 06 0508 for fatfurther analysis showed that saturated and monounsaturated fat intake was associated with elevated risk while polyunsaturated fat intake was unrelated to riskdietary retinol βcarotene vitamin c vitamin e fiber and vitamin supplements were inversely associated with riskno significant association was observed for dietary vitamin b1 or vitamin b2our findings suggest that associations of dietary macronutrients with endometrial cancer risk may depend on their sources with intake of animal origin nutrients being related to higher risk and intake of plant origin nutrients related to lower riskdietary fiber retinol βcarotene vitamin c vitamin e and vitamin supplementation may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer
