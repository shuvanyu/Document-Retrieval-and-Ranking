high dietary intakes of calcium and dairy products have been hypothesized to enhance prostate cancer risk but available prospective data regarding these associations are inconsistentwe examined dietary intakes of calcium and dairy products in relation to risk of prostate cancer in the alphatocopherol betacarotene atbc cancer prevention study a cohort of 29133 male smokers aged 5069 years at study entrydietary intake was assessed at baseline using a validated 276item food use questionnairecox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for known or suspected risk factors for prostate cancerduring 17 years of followup we ascertained 1267 incident cases of prostate cancerhigh versus low intake of dietary calcium was associated with a marked increase in prostate cancer riskthe multivariate relative risk rr of prostate cancer for  or 2000 mgday compared to 1000 mgday of calcium intake was 163 95 confidence interval ci 127210 p trend  00001total dairy intake was also positively associated with risk of prostate cancerthe multivariate rr of prostate cancer comparing extreme quintiles of intake was 126 95 ci 104151 p trend  003however no association with total dairy intake remained after we adjusted for calcium p trend  017findings were similar by stage and grade of prostate cancerthe results from this large prospective study suggest that intake of calcium or some related component contained in dairy foods is associated with increased prostate cancer risk
