background the relation between dairy product intake and the risk of ischemic heart disease ihd remains controversialobjective we aimed to explore biomarkers of dairy fat intake in plasma and erythrocytes and to assess the hypothesis that higher concentrations of these biomarkers are associated with a greater risk of ihd in us womendesign among 32826 participants in the nurses health study who provided blood samples in 19891990 166 incident cases of ihd were ascertained between baseline and 1996these cases were matched with 327 controls for age smoking fasting status and date of blood drawingresults among controls correlation coefficients between average dairy fat intake in 19861990 and 150 and trans 161n7 content were 036 and 030 for plasma and 030 and 032 for erythrocytes respectivelyin multivariate analyses with control for age smoking and other risk factors of ihd women with higher plasma concentrations of 150 had a significantly higher risk of ihdthe multivariateadjusted relative risks 95 ci from the lowest to highest tertile of 150 concentrations in plasma were 10 reference 218 120 398 and 236 116 478 p for trend  003associations for other biomarkers were not significantconclusions plasma and erythrocyte contents of 150 and trans 161n7 can be used as biomarkers of dairy fat intakethese data suggest that a high intake of dairy fat is associated with a greater risk of ihd
