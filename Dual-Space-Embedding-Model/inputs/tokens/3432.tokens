background dairy consumption affects biological pathways associated with carcinogenesisevidence for a link between cancer risk and dairy consumption in adulthood is increasing but associations with childhood dairy consumption have not been studied adequatelyobjective we investigated whether dairy consumption in childhood is associated with cancer incidence and mortality in adulthooddesign from 1937 through 1939 some 4999 children living in england and scotland participated in a study of family food consumption assessed from 7d household food inventoriesthe national health service central register was used to ascertain cancer registrations and deaths between 1948 and 2005 in the 4383 traced cohort membersper capita household intake estimates for dairy products and calcium were used as proxy for individual intakeresults during the followup period 770 cancer registrations or cancer deaths occurredhigh childhood total dairy intake was associated with a neartripling in the odds of colorectal cancer multivariate odds ratio 290 95 ci 126 665 2sided p for trend  0005 compared with low intake independent of meat fruit and vegetable intakes and socioeconomic indicatorsmilk intake showed a similar association with colorectal cancer riskhigh milk intake was weakly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk p for trend  011childhood dairy intake was not associated with breast and stomach cancer risk a positive association with lung cancer risk was confounded by smoking behavior during adulthoodconclusions a family diet rich in dairy products during childhood is associated with a greater risk of colorectal cancer in adulthoodconfirmation of possible underlying biological mechanisms is needed
