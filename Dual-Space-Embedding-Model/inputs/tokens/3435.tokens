background polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and heterocyclic amines hcas are carcinogens formed in or on the surface of welldone meat cooked at high temperaturemethods we estimated breast cancer risk in relation to intake of cooked meat in a populationbased casecontrol study 1508 cases and 1556 controls conducted in long island ny from 1996 to 1997lifetime intakes of grilled or barbecued and smoked meats were derived from the intervieweradministered questionnaire datadietary intakes of pah and hca were derived from the selfadministered modified block food frequency questionnaire of intake 1 year before reference dateunconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cisresults modest increased risk was observed among postmenopausal but not premenopausal women consuming the most grilled or barbecued and smoked meats over the life course or  147 ci  112192 for highest vs lowest tertile of intakepostmenopausal women with low fruit and vegetable intake but high lifetime intake of grilled or barbecued and smoked meats had a higher or of 174 ci  120250no associations were observed with the food frequency questionnairederived intake measures of pahs and hcas with the possible exception of benzoalphapyrene from meat among postmenopausal women whose tumors were positive for both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors or  147 ci  099219conclusions these results support the accumulating evidence that consumption of meats cooked by methods that promote carcinogen formation may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer
