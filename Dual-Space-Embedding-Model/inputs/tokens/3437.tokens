studies attempting to evaluate protein assimilation in humans have hitherto relied on either ileostomy subjects or intubation techniquesthe availability of stable isotopelabeled protein allowed us to determine the amount and fate of dietary protein escaping digestion and absorption in the small intestine of healthy volunteers using noninvasive tracer techniquesten healthy volunteers were studied once after ingestion of a cooked test meal consisting of 25 g of 13c 15n and 2hlabeled egg protein and once after ingestion of the same but raw mealamounts of 573 and 3510 p  0005 of cooked and raw test meal respectively escaped digestion and absorption in the small intestinea significantly higher percentage of the malabsorbed raw egg protein was recovered in urine as fermentation metabolitesthese results 1 confirm that substantial amounts of even easily digestible proteins may escape assimilation in healthy volunteers and 2 further support the hypothesis that the metabolic fate of protein in the colon is affected by the amount of protein made available
