we studied the effect on fecal hydrolytic activities of adopting an uncooked extreme vegan diet and readopting a conventional dieteighteen subjects were randomly divided into test and control groupsin the test group subjects adopted the uncooked extreme vegan diet for 1 mo and then resumed a conventional diet for a second monthcontrols consumed a conventional diet throughout the studyphenol and pcresol concentrations in serum and daily output in urine and fecal enzyme activities were measuredthe activity of fecal urease significantly decreased by 66 as did cholylglycine hydrolase 55 betaglucuronidase 33 and betaglucosidase 40 within 1 wk of beginning the vegan dietthe new level remained throughout the period of consuming this dietphenol and pcresol concentrations in serum and daily outputs in urine significantly declinedthe fecal enzyme activities returned to normal values within 2 wk of resuming the conventional dietconcentrations of phenol and pcresol in serum and daily output in urine had returned to normal after 1 mo of consuming the conventional dietno changes were observed in the control group during the studyresults suggest that this uncooked extreme vegan diet causes a decrease in bacterial enzymes and certain toxic products that have been implicated in colon cancer risk
