it is estimated that most colon cancers can be attributed to dietary causeswe have hypothesized that diet influences the health of the colonic mucosa through interaction with the microbiota and that it is the milieu interior that regulates mucosal proliferation and therefore cancer riskto validate this further we compared colonic contents from healthy 50 to 65yold people from populations with high and low risk specifically low risk native africans cancer incidence 1100000 n  17 high risk african americans risk 65100000 n  17 and caucasian americans risk 50100000 n  18americans typically consume a highanimal protein and fat diet whereas africans consume a staple diet of maize meal rich in resistant starch and low in animal productsfollowing overnight fasting rapid colonic evacuation was performed with 2 l polyethylene glycoltotal colonic evacuants were analyzed for scfa vitamins nitrogen and mineralstotal scfa and butyrate were significantly higher in native africans than in both american groupscolonic folate and biotin content measured by lactobacillus rhamnoses and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8014 bioassay respectively exceeded normal daily dietary intakescompared with africans calcium and iron contents were significantly higher in caucasian americans and zinc content was significantly higher in african americans but nitrogen content did not differ among the 3 groupsin conclusion the results support our hypothesis that the microbiota mediates the effect diet has on colon cancer risk by their generation of butyrate folate and biotin molecules known to play a key role in the regulation of epithelial proliferation
