summary Î³hydroxybutanoic acid ghb is used as a daterape drug which renders the victims unconscious and defencelessintoxications are very difficult to detect for forensic scientists due to rapid metabolism to endogenous levels of ghbwe recently discovered a new major metabolite 2 of ghb 1 that could potentially extend the analytical detection window for ghb intoxicationsherein we disclose synthetic procedures based on a koenigsknorr glucuronidation approach that provides ghb glucuronide 2 and a deuteriumlabelled analogue d 42 of high purity suitable for analytical chemistryin addition we have assessed the stability of ghb glucuronide 2 by mimicking the natural ph range for urine which is of importance in the development of new analytical methodsusing nmr we show that ghb glucuronide 2 is highly stable towards aqueous hydrolysis within the ph range normally observed for urine even at elevated temperature
