fiber is not digested by endogenous enzymes but is fermented by microbes principally in the large intestinewith fermentable energy available microbes synthesize protein by using ammonia released by their enzymes from urea and other nitrogenous substances in ingesta and intestinal secretionsfibber fermentation also yields fatty acids that lower the concentration of free ammonia by lowering phfiber increases bulk and water of intestinal contents shortens transit time and decreases the concentration of toxic substances in contact with the intestinal mucosathese processes decrease duration and intensity of exposure of the intestinal mucosa to free ammonia the form of nitrogen that is most toxic and most readily absorbed by cellsat concentrations found in the lower bowel on usual western diets ammonia destroys cells alters nucleic acid synthesis increases intestinal mucosal cell mass increases virus infections favors growth of cancerous cells over noncancerous cells in tissue culture and increases virus infectionsammonia in the bowel increases as protein intake increasesthe attributes of ammonia and the epidemiological evidence comparing populations that maintain low intakes of unrefined carbohydrate with those that consume high intakes of protein fat and refined carbohydrates implicate ammonia in carcinogenesis and other disease processes
