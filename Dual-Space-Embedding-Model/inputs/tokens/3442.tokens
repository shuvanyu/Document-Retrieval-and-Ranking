it is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the hosts healthprotein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon when carbohydrates get depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as ammonia amines phenols and sulfideshowever the effectivity of these metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studiesin addition some important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer crc and ulcerative colitis appear most often in the distal colon which is the primary site of protein fermentationfinally epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat are associated with the prevalence of crc as is the case in western societyimportantly meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also induces increased intake of fat heme and heterocyclic amines which may also play a role in the development of crcdespite these indications the relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly investigatedin this review the existing evidence about the potential toxicity of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be summarizedcopyright  2012 wileyvch verlag gmbh  co kgaa weinheim
