glucuronidation is an important process in the metabolism of xenobiotic and endogenous substances leading to enhancement of excretion of these compounds from the bodya multigene family encodes a number of udpglucuronosyltransferase enzymes which catalyse this route of metabolismrecent advances in biochemical and molecular biological approaches reviewed here by thomas tephly and brian burchell have given new insight into the function and structure of udpglucuronosyltransferasesthese proteins have surprising similarities and yet appear to be capable of conjugating a remarkable number of different chemicals
