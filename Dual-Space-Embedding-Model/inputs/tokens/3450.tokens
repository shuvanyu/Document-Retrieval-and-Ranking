purpose to report the rate of recanalization and the efficacy of punctal occlusion surgery with a high heatenergyreleasing cautery device in patients with severe dry eye disease and recurrent punctal plug extrusiondesign prospective interventional case seriesmethods seventy puncta from 44 eyes of 28 dry eye patients underwent punctal occlusion with thermal cauteryall patients had a history of recurrent punctal plug extrusiona high heatenergyreleasing thermal cautery device optemp ii v alcon japan was used for punctal occlusion surgerysymptom scores bestcorrected visual acuity fluorescein staining score rose bengal staining score tear film breakup time and schirmer test values were compared before and 3 months after the surgeryrate of punctal recanalization also was examinedresults three months after surgical cauterization symptom score decreased from 39  023 to 056  084 p  0001logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution bestcorrected visual acuity improved from 011  030 to 0013  022 p  003fluorescein staining score rose bengal staining score tear film breakup time and the schirmer test value also improved significantly after the surgeryonly 1 of 70 puncta recanalized after thermal cauterization 14conclusions punctal occlusion with the high heatenergyreleasing cautery device not only was associated with a low recanalization rate but also with improvements in ocular surface wetness and better visual acuitycopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
