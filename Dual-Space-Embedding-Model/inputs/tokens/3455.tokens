it has been suggested that tear fluid is isotonic with plasma and plasma osmolality posm is an accepted albeit invasive hydration markerour aim was to determine whether tear fluid osmolarity tosm assessed using a new portable noninvasive rapid collection and measurement device tracks hydrationpurpose this study aimed to compare changes in tosm and another widely used noninvasive marker urine specific gravity usg with changes in posm during hypertonichypovolemiamethods in a randomized order 14 healthy volunteers exercised in the heat on one occasion with fluid restriction fr until 1 2 and 3 body mass loss bml and with overnight fluid restriction until 0800 h the following day and on another occasion with fluid intake fivolunteers were rehydrated between 0800 and 1100 h tosm was assessed using the tearlab osmolarity systemresults posm and usg increased with progressive dehydration on fr p  0001tosm increased significantly on fr from 293  9 to 305  13 mosml1 at 3 bml and remained elevated overnight 304  14 mosml1 p  0001posm and tosm decreased during exercise on fi and returned to preexercise values the following morningrehydration restored posm usg and tosm to within preexercise valuesthe mean correlation between tosm and posm was r  093 and that between usg and posm was r  072conclusions tosm increased with dehydration and tracked alterations in posm with comparable utility to usgmeasuring tosm using the tearlab osmolarity system may offer sports medicine practitioners clinicians and research investigators a practical and rapid hydration assessment technique
