diet is a major environmental source of proinflammatory ages heatgenerated advanced glycation end products its impact in humans remains unclearwe explored the effects of two equivalent diets one regular high age hage and the other with 5fold lower age lage content on inflammatory mediators of 24 diabetic subjects 11 in a 2week crossover and 13 in a 6week studyafter 2 weeks on hage serum ages increased by 645 p  002 and on lage decreased by 30 p  002the mononuclear cell tumor necrosis factorαβactin mrna ratio was 14  05 on hage and 09  05 on lage p  005 whereas serum vascular adhesion molecule1 was 1108  429 and 698  347 ngml p  001 on l and hage respectivelyafter 6 weeks peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor necrosis factorα rose by 863 p  0006 and declined by 20 p not significant on h or lage diet respectively creactive protein increased by 35 on hage and decreased by 20 on lage p  0014 and vascular adhesion molecule1 declined by 20 on lage p  001 and increased by 4 on hageserum ages were increased by 282 on hage p  006 and reduced by 40 on lage p  002 whereas age low density lipoprotein was increased by 32 on hage and reduced by 33 on lage diet p  005thus in diabetes environmental dietary ages promote inflammatory mediators leading to tissue injuryrestriction of dietary ages suppresses these effects
