several prospective studies have reported that risk of type 2 diabetes t2dm is elevated in meat consumers especially when processed meats are consumedelevated risks of coronary heart disease chd and stroke in meat consumers have also been reportedin this overview the evidence regarding meat consumption and the risk of diabetes both type 1 diabetes t1dm and t2dm and their macro and microvascular complications is reviewedfor t2dm we performed a new metaanalysis including publications up to october 2012for t1dm only a few studies have reported increased risks for meat consumers or for high intake of saturated fatty acids and nitrates and nitritesfor t2dm chd and stroke the evidence is strongestper 100 g of total meat the pooled relative risk rr for t2dm is 115 95  ci 107124 for unprocessed red meat 113 95  ci 103123 and for poultry 104 95  ci 099133 per 50 g of processed meat the pooled rr is 132 95  ci 119148hence the strongest association regarding t2dm is observed for processed red meata similar observation has been made for chdfor stroke however a recent metaanalysis shows moderately elevated risks for meat consumers for processed as well as for fresh meatsfor the microvascular complications of diabetes few prospective data were available but suggestions for elevated risks can be derived from findings on hyperglycemia and hypertensionthe results are discussed in the light of the typical nutrients and other compounds present in meatthat is saturated and trans fatty acids dietary cholesterol protein and amino acids hemeiron sodium nitrites and nitrosamines and advanced glycation end productsin light of these findings a diet moderate to low in red meat unprocessed and lean and prepared at moderate temperatures is probably the best choice from the public health point of view
