the present metaanalysis shows no clear association between coffee consumption and the risk of hip fracturesthere was a nonlinear association between tea consumption and the risk of hip fracturecompared to no tea consumption drinking 14 cups of tea daily was associated with a lower risk of hip fractureintroduction prospective cohort and casecontrol studies have suggested that coffee and tea consumption may be associated with the risk of hip fracture the results have however been inconsistentwe conducted a metaanalysis to assess the association between coffee and tea consumption and the risk of hip fracturemethods we performed systematic searches using medline embase and ovid until february 20 2013 without limits of language or publication yearrelative risks rrs with 95 confidence intervals ci were derived using randomeffects models throughout all analyseswe conducted categorical doseresponse heterogeneity publication bias and subgroup analysesresults our study was based on 195992 individuals with 9958 cases of hip fractures from 14 studies including six cohort and eight casecontrol studiesthe pooled rrs of hip fractures for the highest vs the lowest categories of coffee and tea consumption were 094 95 ci 071117 and 084 95 ci 066102 respectivelyfor the doseresponse analysis we found evidence of a nonlinear association between tea consumption and the risk of hip fracture pnonlinearity  001compared to no tea consumption 14 cups of tea per day may reduce the risk of hip fracture by 28 072 95 ci 056088 for 12 cupsday 37 063 95 ci 032094 for 23 cupsday and 21 079 95 ci 062096 for 34 cupsdayconclusions we found no significant association between coffee consumption and the risk of hip fracturea nonlinear association emerged between tea consumption and the risk of hip fracture individuals drinking 14 cups of tea per day exhibited a lower risk of hip fractures than those who drank no teathe association between 5 daily cups of tea or more and hip fracture risk should be investigated
