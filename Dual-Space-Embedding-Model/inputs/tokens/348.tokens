we examined the relationship of elevated depressive symptoms with antioxidant statuscrosssectional data from the national health and nutrition examination surveys 200506 on us adults aged 2085 years were analyzeddepressive symptoms were measured using the patient health questionnaire with a score cutpoint of 10 to define elevated depressive symptomsserum antioxidant status was measured by serum levels of carotenoids retinol free and retinyl esters vitamin c and vitamin e the main analyses consisted of multiple logistic and zeroinflated poisson regression models taking into account sampling design complexitythe final sample consisted of 1798 us adults with complete datahigher total carotenoid serum level was associated with lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms with a reduction in the odds by 37 overall with each sd increase in exposure and by 34 among women p005a doseresponse relationship was observed when serum total carotenoids were expressed as quartiles q4 162101 μmoll vs q1006086 μmoll or041 95 ci 023076 p0001 pvalue for trend0035 though no significant associations were found with other antioxidant levelsamong carotenoids βcarotene men and women combined and luteinzeaxanthins women only after control for dietary luteinzeaxanthin intake and supplement use had an independent inverse association with elevated depressive symptoms among us adultsnone of the other serum antioxidants had a significant association with depressive symptoms independently of total carotenoids and other covariatesin conclusion total carotenoids mainly βcarotene and luteinzeaxanthins in serum were associated with reduced levels of depressive symptoms among communitydwelling us adults
