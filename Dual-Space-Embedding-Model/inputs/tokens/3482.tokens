background coffee and tea are believed to cause gastrooesophageal reflux however the effects of these beverages and of their major component caffeine have not been quantifiedthe aim of this study was to evaluate gastrooesophageal reflux induced by coffee and tea before and after a decaffeination process and to compare it with water and watercontaining caffeinemethods threehour ambulatory phmetry was performed on 16 healthy volunteers who received 300 ml of i regular coffee decaffeinated coffee or tap water n  16 ii normal tea decaffeinated tea tap water or coffee adapted to normal tea in caffeine concentration n  6 and iii caffeinefree and caffeinecontaining water n  8 together with a standardized breakfastresults regular coffee induced a significant p  005 gastrooesophageal reflux compared with tap water and normal tea which were not different from each otherdecaffeination of coffee significantly p  005 diminished gastrooesophageal reflux whereas decaffeination of tea or addition of caffeine to water had no effectcoffee adapted to normal tea in caffeine concentration significantly p  005 increased gastrooesophageal refluxconclusions coffee in contrast to tea increases gastrooesophageal reflux an effect that is less pronounced after decaffeinationcaffeine does not seem to be responsible for gastrooesophageal reflux which must be attributed to other components of coffee
