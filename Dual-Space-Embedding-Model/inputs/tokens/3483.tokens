background caffeine is widely consumed and its effect on intraocular pressure iop has been reported in conflicting datathe aim of this metaanalysis was to quantitatively summarize the effect of caffeine on iop in normal individuals and in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension ohtmethods a comprehensive literature search was performed using the cochrane collaboration methodology to identify pertinent randomized controlled trials rcts from the cochrane central register of controlled trials central pubmed and embasea systematic review and metaanalysis was performediop at 05 hour h 1 h and 15 h after caffeine ingestion was the main outcome measurementresults six rcts two paralleldesigned and four crossoverdesigned evaluating 144 participants fulfilled inclusion criteriathe risk of bias for these studies was uncertainamong the participants 103 were normal individuals and 41 were patients with glaucoma or ohtin normal individuals the iops measured at 05 h 1 h and 15 h postintervention were not affected by ingestion of caffeinethe weighted mean difference wmd with 95 confidence intervals 95ci for each measurement point were 0740 2454 0974 0522 0568 1613 and 0580 1524 2684however in patients with glaucoma or oht iop increased at each measurement point with the wmd and 95ci being 0347 0078 0616 2395 17413049 and 1998 15222474 respectivelyno publication bias was detected by either beggs or eggers testconclusion available evidences showed that caffeine had different effects on iop in different groups of individualsfor normal individuals iop was not changed by ingestion of caffeine while for patients with glaucoma or oht iop increased significantlymore highquality rcts are warranted to confirm thisthe mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the clinical significance are to be explored
