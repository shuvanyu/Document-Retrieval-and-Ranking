objectives the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the phenolic content of virgin olive oil on endothelial reactivitybackground endothelialdependent vasodilatation is impaired during the postprandial state and oxidative stress could play a key role in its developmentmethods twentyone hypercholesterolemic volunteers received two breakfasts using a randomized sequential crossover designboth arms received the same olive oil but one had its phenolic acid content reduced from 400 to 80 ppmischemic reactive hyperemia irh was measured with a laserdoppler procedure at baseline and 2 h and 4 h after oil intakepostprandial plasma concentrations of lipid fractions lipoperoxides lpo 8epi prostaglandinf2alpha and nitratesnitrites nox were obtained at baseline and after 2 h of the fat mealresults the intake of the polyphenolrich breakfast was associated with an improvement in endothelial function as well as a greater increase in concentrations of nox p  0001 and a lower increase in lpo p  0005 and 8epi prostaglandinf2alpha p  0001 than the ones induced by the low polyphenol fat meala positive correlation was found to exist between nox and enhanced endothelial function at the second hour r  0669 p  001furthermore a negative correlation was found between irh and lpo r  0203 p  005 and 8epi prostaglandinf2alpha levels r  0440 p  005conclusions a meal containing highphenolic virgin olive oil improves ischemic reactive hyperemia during the postprandial statethis phenomenon might be mediated via reduction in oxidative stress and the increase of nitric oxide metabolites
