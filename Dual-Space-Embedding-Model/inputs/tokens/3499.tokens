context the metabolic syndrome has been identified as a target for dietary therapies to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease however the role of diet in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome is poorly understoodobjective to assess the effect of a mediterraneanstyle diet on endothelial function and vascular inflammatory markers in patients with the metabolic syndromedesign setting and patients randomized singleblind trial conducted from june 2001 to january 2004 at a university hospital in italy among 180 patients 99 men and 81 women with the metabolic syndrome as defined by the adult treatment panel iiiinterventions patients in the intervention group n  90 were instructed to follow a mediterraneanstyle diet and received detailed advice about how to increase daily consumption of whole grains fruits vegetables nuts and olive oil patients in the control group n  90 followed a prudent diet carbohydrates 5060 proteins 1520 total fat 30main outcome measures nutrient intake endothelial function score as a measure of blood pressure and platelet aggregation response to larginine lipid and glucose parameters insulin sensitivity and circulating levels of highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp and interleukins 6 il6 7 il7 and 18 il18results after 2 years patients following the mediterraneanstyle diet consumed more foods rich in monounsaturated fat polyunsaturated fat and fiber and had a lower ratio of omega6 to omega3 fatty acidstotal fruit vegetable and nuts intake 274 gd whole grain intake 103 gd and olive oil consumption 8 gd were also significantly higher in the intervention group p001the level of physical activity increased in both groups by approximately 60 without difference between groups p 22mean sd body weight decreased more in patients in the intervention group 40 11 kg than in those in the control group 12 06 kg p001compared with patients consuming the control diet patients consuming the intervention diet had significantly reduced serum concentrations of hscrp p 01 il6 p 04 il7 p  04 and il18 p  03 as well as decreased insulin resistance p001endothelial function score improved in the intervention group mean sd change 19 06 p001 but remained stable in the control group 02 02 p 33at 2 years of followup 40 patients in the intervention group still had features of the metabolic syndrome compared with 78 patients in the control group p001conclusion a mediterraneanstyle diet might be effective in reducing the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular risk
