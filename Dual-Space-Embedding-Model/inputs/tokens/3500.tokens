high postprandial serum lipid concentrations are associated with increased oxidative stress which in turn increases the risk of atherosclerosisepidemiological studies correlate lower incidence of cardiovascular disease with adherence to the mediterranean dietthe aim of this study was to evaluate changes in inflammatory txb2 and ltb4 and oxidative stress markers urinary hydrogen peroxide levels and serum antioxidant capacity in addition to classic lipid parameters after a fatrich meal administered to 12 normolipemic healthy subjectsfollowing a latin square design subjects were divided into three groups each one receiving a different kind of oil extra virgin olive oil evoo olive oil oo or corn oil co together with 150g of potatoes with 2week washout periods between treatmentsblood samples were drawn at baseline and after 1 2 and 6h after the meala significant decrease in inflammatory markers namely txb2 and ltb4 after 2 and 6h after evoo but not oo or co consumption and a concomitant increase of serum antioxidant capacity were recordedthese data reinforce the notion that the mediterranean diet reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease partially due to the protective role of its phenolic components including those of extra virgin olive oil
