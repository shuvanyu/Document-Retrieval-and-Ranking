current national cholesterol education program guidelines consider desirable total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels to be  200 and  160 mgdl respectively for healthy individuals without multiple coronary risk factorsto determine the extent to which these levels affect vascular function we assessed flowmediated endotheliumdependent brachial artery vasoactivity noninvasively before during and after cholesterol lowering simvastatin 10 mgday in 7 healthy middleaged men with cholesterol levels meeting current recommendationsflowmediated brachial artery vasoactivity was measured using 75 mhz ultrasound and expressed as percent diameter change from baseline to hyperemic conditions 1 minute following 5 minutes of blood pressure cuff arterial occlusionflowmediated vasoactivity rose from 50  36 at baseline to 105  56 133  43 and 157  49 all p  005 as cholesterol fell from 200  12 to 161  18 169  16 and 153  11 mgdl after 2 4 and 12 weeks respectively of cholesterollowering therapyvasoactivity and cholesterol returned to baseline levels 12 weeks after simvastatin discontinuationoverall vasoactivity was found to correlate inversely with cholesterol levels r  047 p  0004these data suggest that flowmediated brachial artery vasoactivity responds rapidly to changes in cholesterol levels and that endothelial function improves by lowering cholesterol levels below recommendations of current guidelines
