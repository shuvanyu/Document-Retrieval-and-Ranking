background and aim currently more than 30 of the caloric intake in the colombian population comes from vegetable oil consumption mainly by the ingestion of deepfried foodsrecently it has been reported that unsaturated fatty acid rich oils have a beneficial effect on the endothelial functionnevertheless it is well know that the deepfrying process alters the chemical composition of vegetable oils and can produce adverse effects in the endothelial functionobjective to evaluate the acute effect of the ingestion of large amounts of olive soybean and palm oils fresh and at two different deepfry levels on the glucose and lipid profiles and the endothelial functionmethods and results ten healthy young volunteers were included in the studyafter performing a baseline evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors and drawing a fasting blood sample subjects were exposed to a randomly assigned potato soup meal containing 60 ml of one of three different vegetable oils olive soybean and palm either fresh or at one of two different deepfry levels 10 and 20 fries respectivelyflowmediated vasodilation fmd was performed in fasting conditions and 3h after the intake of the oil rich mealfurthermore blood samples were taken at these stages for the lipid profiles and plasma glucose determinationsall the meals resulted in a similar acute endothelial impairment fmd decrease of 321 confidence interval ci 95 280362 and postprandial increase in triglycerides 2703 ci 95 205333 independently of the type of oil ingested p044 and regardless of its deepfry level p062no correlation was found between endothelial impairment and postprandial triglyceride increment r022 p009conclusions no difference was found in the acute adverse effect of the ingestion of different vegetable oils on the endothelial functionall the vegetable oils fresh and deepfried produced an increase in the triglyceride plasma levels in healthy subjects
