traditional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with endothelial dysfunctionthe vascular endothelium plays a key role in local vascular tone regulation and can be modulated by dietary fatwe propose to determine the chronic effect of three diets with different fat compositions on postprandial endothelial function and inflammatory biomarkerstwenty healthy men followed three 4week diets in a randomised crossover design a western diet rich in saturated fat 22 sfa 12 mufa and 04 alphalinolenic acid ala all fractions are  of energy a mediterranean diet rich in mufa   10  sfa 24  mufa and 04 ala a lowfat diet enriched in ala   10 sfa 12 mufa and 2 alaat the end of each dietary period all subjects underwent a postprandial studyplasma concentrations of lipid parameters soluble intercellular celladhesion molecule1 soluble vascular celladhesion molecule1 svcam1 nitrates and nitrites nox and endothelial function studied by laser doppler were examined at 0 2 4 6 and 8 h the endotheliumdependent vasodilatory response was greater 4 h after the ingestion of the mufarich diet than after the sfa or ala lowfat diets p  0031the 4 h postprandial plasma svcam1 levels were lower after the mufa meals than after the ala lowfat diet p  0043the bioavailability of nox was higher following the mufa diet than after the sfa and ala lowfat diets p  0027we found no differences in the other parameters measuredchronic ingestion of a mediterranean diet avoids the postprandial deterioration of endothelial function associated with westernised diets in healthy individuals
