objective the olive oilrich mediterranean diet protects against cardiovascular disease which involves inflammatory processesthis study investigated the effects of phenolic compounds found in extra virgin olive oil on inflammatory mediator production by human mononuclear cellsmethods diluted human blood cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence of phenolics vanillic pcoumaric syringic homovanillic and caffeic acids kaempferol oleuropein glycoside and tyrosol at concentrations of 107 to 104 m concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factoralpha interleukin1beta and interleukin6 and of the inflammatory eicosanoid prostaglandin e2 were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assayresults oleuropein glycoside and caffeic acid decreased the concentration of interleukin1betaat a concentration of 104 m oleuropein glycoside inhibited interleukin1beta production by 80 whereas caffeic acid inhibited production by 40kaempferol decreased the concentration of prostaglandin e2at a concentration of 104 m kaempferol inhibited prostaglandin e2 production by 95no effects were seen on concentrations of interleukin6 or tumor necrosis factoralpha and there were no effects of the other phenolic compoundsconclusions some but not all phenolic compounds derived from extra virgin olive oil decrease inflammatory mediator production by human whole blood culturesthis may contribute to the antiatherogenic properties ascribed to extra virgin olive oil
