objectives this study was designed to investigate a possible mechanism of postprandial anginabackground postprandial angina has been recognized for more than two centuries however its mechanism is still controversialthe most widely accepted mechanism involves increased myocardial oxygen demand after food intakerecently the redistribution in coronary blood flow cbf was suggested as a possible mechanismmethods twenty young healthy volunteer controls and 20 patients with significant stenosis in the left anterior descending lad or left main coronary artery were enrolled in the studycoronary blood flow was evaluated in the distal lad by using transthoracic doppler echocardiography before and 15 30 45 and 60 min after food intakein the cbf curve the time velocity integral of diastolic flow dtvi and the product of dtvi and heart rate hr were measuredin six patients these measurements were repeated after successful coronary interventionresults in the healthy volunteer controls dtvi and dtvi x hr increased after food intake with a peak value at 15 min which indicates the presence of postprandial surge in the cbffasting values and peak values at 15 min were significantly different dtvi 151  49 cms vs 189  59 cms p  004 dtvi x hr 8622  2615 cmmin vs 11742  3075 p  0002in contrast with the controls despite postprandial increase in double product hr x blood pressure dtvi and dtvi x hr in the patient group decreased after food intake with a nadir value at 45 minfasting values and nadir values at 45 min were significantly different dtvi 240  196 cms vs 193  171 cms p  0001 dtvi x hr 14496  10440 cmmin vs 12734  10009 cmmin p  0002in six patients the cbf pattern resumed the normal pattern of postprandial surge in the cbf after successful coronary interventionconclusions results of our study suggest that steal phenomenon may play a role in the mechanism of postprandial angina
