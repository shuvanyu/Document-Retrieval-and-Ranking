background cellular changes lead to coronary artery endothelial dysfunction ed and precede plaque formationclinical events such as unstable angina and acute coronary syndromes are common consequences of edcoronary artery ed as characterized by rb82 pe is a perfusion abnormality at rest which improves following stressin risk factor modification studies particularly in cholesterollowering trials coronary artery ed has been demonstrated to be reversibleother studies have correlated low fat diet modification with improvement in coronary artery diseasepurpose this study evaluates changes in myocardial perfusion following meals with low versus high tg content and its influence on post prandial serum tgmethods with a randomized double blind placebo controlled cross over design we investigated 19 patients 10 with ed and 9 with normal perfusion with rb82 pet for myocardial blood flow at rest and with adenosine stresspet images and serum triglycerides were obtained before and after an olestra oa meal 27g tg 44g olestra and a highfat meal 467g tgmeals were matched for carbohydrate protein and cholesterol contentresults myocardial perfusion ucicc increased 11  12 following the oa meal compared to the highfat meal in patients with edfor all patients combined serum tg increased significantly p  001 in the nonoa group with the median change from baseline to 1700 mgdl compared to 215 mgdl in the oa group during the 6 hours following the mealconclusions a single olestra meal significantly diminishes post prandial serum tg levels and improves myocardial perfusion in patients with endothelial disease
