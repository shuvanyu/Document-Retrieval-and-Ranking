objectives this study was designed to determine the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with postprandial angina pectorisbackground postprandial angina is a manifestation of coronary artery diseasealthough seen in clinical practice very little has been published about the syndrome and no anatomic correlations have been describedmethods questionnaires were given to 408 patients with chest pain and objective evidence of ischemiathirtyfive patients 86 were identified as having postprandial angina group athe other 373 patients group b had nonpostprandial angina and served as the control groupcoronary angiography was performed in all patients and the results were analyzedresults postprandial angina was observed predominantly in men 91 vs 66 p  00036it was associated with a high incidence of rest angina 83 in group a vs 51 in group b p  00005 and a very high incidence of left main 34 vs 10 p  00001 and threevessel 82 vs 54 p  0001 coronary artery diseasethe ejection fraction was lower as well in these patients 039 vs 047 p  0046postprandial angina occurred at rest and on exertion most commonly after dinnerconclusions postprandial angina is a likely marker of severe coronary artery disease and should be considered an indication for coronary angiography
