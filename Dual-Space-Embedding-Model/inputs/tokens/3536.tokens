the evidence supporting the thesis that hypertension can be prevented by eliminating salt from the diet is based on four principal sources 1 epidemiological studies in unacculturated peoples showing that the prevalence of hypertension is inversely correlated with the degree of salt intake 2 hemodynamic studies suggesting that the development of chronic experimental hypertension is a homeostatic response to a maintained increase in extracellular fluid volume ecf 3 evidence that the ecf of salt eaters is expanded in comparison to that of nosalt eaters and 4 investigations in hypertensive patients receiving either diets greatly restricted in salt or continuous diuretic therapy which correlate the fall in blood pressure with a reduction in ecfalthough this mechanism of essential hypertension is still obscure the evidence is very good if not conclusive that reduction of salt in the diet to below 2 gday would result in the prevention of essential hypertension and its disappearance as a major public health problem
