the supraclavicular region is a common site for lymph node metastasesa commonly reported type of nonmalignant 18ffdg uptake on pet imaging in the supraclavicular region is muscle uptake purportedly due to muscle contraction in tense patients during the 18ffdg uptake phasepetct offers the unique opportunity to correlate pet findings with ct anatomy in the supraclavicular regionmethods images from the first 359 consecutive clinical wholebody studies in 347 patients using 18ffdg and a petct scanner with ct attenuation correction and orderedsubsets expectation maximization osem reconstruction were retrospectively reviewedthe supraclavicular region was evaluated for the presence of abnormal uptake on pet images and the corresponding ct findings were assessedthree distinct patterns of abnormal 18ffdg uptake were noted pattern a uptake localizing to supraclavicular area fat usafat ie without corresponding lymph node or muscle uptake on ct pattern b uptake localizing to muscle on ct and pattern c uptake localizing to lymph nodes or softtissue masses on ctresults fortynine patients 141 32 female 17 male mean age 514  156 y age range 1277 y showed abnormal 18ffdg uptake in the supraclavicular regiontwenty patients 58 had muscle uptake group b 15 43 had definite abnormal lymph nodes group chowever 14 patients 40 had usafat group a and foci of very low hounsfield units on ctthese foci were also present on 68ge attenuationcorrected images when obtained and nonattenuationcorrected imagesuptake in usafat was typically bilateral and symmetric intense more often multifocal than linear and located in fat on petctage was not significantly different for group c versus the 2 other groupsintensity mean standardized uptake value lean suvl mean or maximum standardized uptake value lean suvl max did not allow differentiation between patterns a and c p  005standardized uptake values suvl max 31 suvl mean 21 were significantly lower in group b than in the 2 other groups p  0005conclusion socalled muscle uptake in the supraclavicular region may be caused in a significant proportion of cases by an unrelated process we call the usafat finding with 18ffdg uptake in tissues of lowhounsfield fat densitythis finding most likely reflects an underlying nonpathologic process that we hypothesize to be in foci of brown fatthis intense supraclavicular uptake should be recognized and should not be misinterpreted as a malignant metastatic process or as muscle uptake
