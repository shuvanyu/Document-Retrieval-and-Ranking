we here discuss the role of brown adipose tissue on energy homeostasis and assess its potential as a target for body weight managementbecause of their high number of mitochondria and the presence of uncoupling protein 1 brown fat adipocytes can be termed as energy inefficient for adenosine5triphosphate atp production but energy efficient for heat productionthus the energy inefficiency of atp production despite high energy substrate oxidation allows brown adipose tissue to generate heat for body temperature regulationwhether such thermogenic property also plays a role in body weight regulation is still debatedthe recent rediscovery of brown adipose tissue in human adults and a better understanding of brown adipose tissue development have encouraged the quest for new alternatives to treat obesity since obese individuals seem to have less brown adipose tissue massactivity than do their lean counterpartsin this review we discuss the physiological relevance of brown adipose tissue on thermogenesis and its potential usefulness on body weight control in humans
