brown adipose tissue bat can be identified by 18ffluorodeoxyglucose fdgpositron emission tomography pet in adult humansthirteen healthy male volunteers aged 2028 years underwent fdgpet after 2h cold exposure at 19 c with lightclothing and intermittently putting their legs on an ice blockwhen exposed to cold 6 out of the 13 subjects showed marked fdg uptake into adipose tissue of the supraclavicular and paraspinal regions batpositive group whereas the remaining seven showed no detectable uptake batnegative groupthe bmi and body fat content were similar in the two groupsunder warm conditions at 27 c the energy expenditure of the batpositive group estimated by indirect calorimetry was 1446  97 kcalday being comparable with that of the batnegative group 1434  246 kcaldayafter cold exposure the energy expenditure increased markedly by 410  293 p  005 and slightly by 42  114 kcalday p  037 in the batpositive and negative groups respectivelya positive correlation p  005 was found between the coldinduced rise in energy expenditure and the bat activity quantified from fdg uptakeafter cold exposure the skin temperature in the supraclavicular region close to bat deposits dropped by 014 c in the batpositive group whereas it dropped more markedly p  001 by 060 c in the batnegative groupthe skin temperature drop in other regions apart from bat deposits was similar in the two groupsthese results suggest that bat is involved in coldinduced increases in wholebody energy expenditure and thereby the control of body temperature and adiposity in adult humans
