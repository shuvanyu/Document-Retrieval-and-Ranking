brown adipose tissue bat burns fat to produce heat when the body is exposed to cold and plays a role in energy metabolismusing fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography and computed tomography we previously reported that bat decreases with age and thereby accelerates agerelated accumulation of body fat in humansthus the recruitment of bat may be effective for body fat reductionin this study we examined the effects of repeated stimulation by cold and capsinoids nonpungent capsaicin analogs in healthy human subjects with low bat activityacute cold exposure at 19c for 2 hours increased energy expenditure eecoldinduced increments of ee cit strongly correlated with bat activity independently of age and fatfree massdaily 2hour cold exposure at 17c for 6 weeks resulted in a parallel increase in bat activity and cit and a concomitant decrease in body fat masschanges in bat activity and body fat mass were negatively correlatedsimilarly daily ingestion of capsinoids for 6 weeks increased citthese results demonstrate that human bat can be recruited even in individuals with decreased bat activity thereby contributing to body fat reduction
