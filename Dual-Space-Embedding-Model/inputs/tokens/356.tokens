background plaque rupture andor erosion is the leading cause of cardiovascular events however the process is not well understoodalthough certain morphologic characteristics have been associated with ruptured plaques these observations are of static histological images and not of the dynamics of plaque ruptureto elucidate the process of plaque rupture we investigated the transformation of cholesterol from liquid to solid crystal to determine whether growing crystals are capable of injuring the plaque caphypothesis we hypothesized that during cholesterol crystallization the spatial configuration rapidly changes causing forceful expansion of sharpedged crystals that can damage the plaque capmethods two experiments were performed in vitro first cholesterol powder was melted in graduated cylinders and allowed to crystallize at room temperaturevolume changes from liquid to solid state were measured and timedsecond thin biological membranes 2040 microm were put in the path of growing crystals to determine damage during crystallizationresults as cholesterol crystallized the peak volume increased rapidly by up to 45 over 3 min and sharptipped crystals cut through and tore membranesthe amount of cholesterol and peak level of crystal growth correlated directly r  098 p  001 as did the amount of cholesterol and rate of crystal growth r  099 p  001conclusions these observations suggest that crystallization of supersaturated cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques can induce cap rupture andor erosionthis novel insight may help in the development of therapeutic strategies that can alter cholesterol crystallization and prevent acute cardiovascular events
