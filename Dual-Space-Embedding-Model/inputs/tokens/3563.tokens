although there is a wellestablished relation between serum cholesterol and coronary artery disease risk individual and national variations in this association suggest that other factors are involved in atherogenesishighfat diet associated triglyceriderich lipoproteins have also been suggested to be atherogenicto assess the direct effect of postprandial triglyceriderich lipoproteins on endothelial function an early factor in atherogenesis10 healthy normocholesterolemic volunteerswere studied before and for 6 hours after single isocaloric high and lowfat meals 900 calorie 50 and 0 g fat respectivelyendothelial function in the form of flowmediated vasoactivity was assessed in the brachial artery using 75mhz ultrasound as percent arterial diameter change 1 minute after 5 minutes of upperarm arterial occlusionserum lipoproteins and glucose were determined before eating and 2 and 4 hours postprandiallyserum triglycerides increased from 94  55 mgdl preprandially to 147  80 mgdl 2 hours after the highfat meal p  005flowdependent vasoactivity decreased from 21  5 preprandially to 11  4 11  6 and 10  3 at 2 3 and 4 hours after the highfat meal respectively all p 005 compared with lowfat meal datano changes in lipoproteins or flowmediated vasoactivity were observed after the lowfat mealfasting lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol correlated inversely r  047 p  004 with preprandial flowmediated vasoactivity but triglyceride level did notmean change in postprandial flowmediated vasoactivity at 2 3 and 4 hours correlated with change in 2hour serum triglycerides r  051 p  002these results demonstrate that a single highfat meal transiently impairs endothelial functionthese findings identify a potential process by which a highfat diet may be atherogenic independent of induced changes in cholesterol
