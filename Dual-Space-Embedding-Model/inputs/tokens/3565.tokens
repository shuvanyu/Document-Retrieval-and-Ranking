the gastrointestinal microbiota produces shortchain fatty acids especially butyrate which affect colonic health immune function and epigenetic regulationto assess the effects of nutrition and aging on the production of butyrate the butyrylcoaacetate coatransferase gene and population shifts of clostridium clusters lv and xlva the main butyrate producers were analysedfaecal samples of young healthy omnivores 24  25 years vegetarians 26  5 years and elderly 86  8 years omnivores were evaluateddiet and lifestyle were assessed in questionnairebased interviewsthe elderly had significantly fewer copies of the butyrylcoaacetate coatransferase gene than young omnivores p0014 while vegetarians showed the highest number of copies p0048the thermal denaturation of the butyrylcoaacetate coatransferase gene variant melting curve related to roseburiaeubacterium rectale sppwas significantly more variable in the vegetarians than in the elderlythe clostridium cluster xiva was more abundant in vegetarians p0049 and in omnivores p001 than in the elderly groupgastrointestinal microbiota of the elderly is characterized by decreased butyrate production capacity reflecting increased risk of degenerative diseasesthese results suggest that the butyrylcoaacetate coatransferase gene is a valuable marker for gastrointestinal microbiota function 2011 federation of european microbiological societiespublished by blackwell publishing ltd all rights reserved
