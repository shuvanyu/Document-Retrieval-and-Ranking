backgroundaim a vegetarian diet is known to prevent a series of diseases but may influence the balance of carbohydrate and fat metabolism as well as collagen synthesisthis study compares expression patterns of relevant genes in oral mucosa of omnivores and vegetariansmethods quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was applied for analysis of mrna levels from carnitine transporter octn2 hepatic cpt1a and nonhepatic cpt1b isoforms of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and collagen ccol2a1 in oral mucosaresults compared with volunteers with traditional eating habits carbohydrate consumption was significantly higher 22 in vegetariansthis was associated with a significant stimulation of cpt1a 50 and octn2 10 and a lowered collagen synthesis 10conclusion these novel findings provide further insight into the association of a changed fat metabolism and reduced collagen synthesis in vegetarians which could also play a role in the aging processcopyright 2008 s karger ag basel
