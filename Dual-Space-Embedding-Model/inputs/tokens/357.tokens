plaque disruption pd causes most acute cardiovascular eventsalthough cholesterol crystals ccs have been observed in plaques their role in pd was unknownhowever cholesterol expands with crystallization tearing and perforating fibrous tissuesthis study tested the hypothesis that ccs can damage plaques and intima triggering pd as observed in tissues prepared without ethanol solvents that dissolve ccscoronary arteries of patients who died of acute coronary syndrome n  19 and nonacute coronary syndrome causes n  12 and carotid plaques from patients with n  51 and without n  19 neurologic symptoms were studiedsamples were examined for ccs perforating the intima using light and scanning electron microscopy sem with ethanol or vacuum dehydrationin addition fresh unfixed carotid plaques were examined at 37 degrees c using confocal microscopycrystal content using sem was scored from 0 to 3sem using vacuum dehydration had significantly higher crystal content compared with sem using ethanol dehydration 25  053 vs 025  046 p 00003 with enhanced detection of cc perforationsthe presence of ccs using sem and confocal microscopy was similar suggesting that cc perforation can occur in vivo at 37 degrees c all patients with acute coronary syndrome had perforating ccs but none was present in patients without acute coronary syndrome p  00001for all plaques there were strong associations of ccs with pd thrombus symptoms p 00001 and plaque size p 002crystal content was an independent predictor of thrombus and symptomsin conclusion by avoiding ethanol in tissue preparation ccs perforating the intima were shown to be associated with pdcrystal content was significantly associated with clinical events suggesting that cholesterol crystallization may have a role in pd
