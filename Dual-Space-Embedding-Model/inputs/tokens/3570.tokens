summary background and objectives patients with advanced chronic kidney disease ckd are in positive phosphorus balance but phosphorus levels are maintained in the normal range through phosphaturia induced by increases in fibroblast growth factor23 fgf23 and parathyroid hormone pththis provides the rationale for recommendations to restrict dietary phosphate intake to 800 mgdhowever the protein source of the phosphate may also be importantdesign setting participants  measurements we conducted a crossover trial in nine patients with a mean estimated gfr of 32 mlmin to directly compare vegetarian and meat diets with equivalent nutrients prepared by clinical research staffduring the last 24 hours of each 7day diet period subjects were hospitalized in a research center and urine and blood were frequently monitoredresults the results indicated that 1 week of a vegetarian diet led to lower serum phosphorus levels and decreased fgf23 levelsthe inpatient stay demonstrated similar diurnal variation for blood phosphorus calcium pth and urine fractional excretion of phosphorus but significant differences between the vegetarian and meat dietsfinally the 24hour fractional excretion of phosphorus was highly correlated to a 2hour fasting urine collection for the vegetarian diet but not the meat dietconclusions in summary this study demonstrates that the source of protein has a significant effect on phosphorus homeostasis in patients with ckdtherefore dietary counseling of patients with ckd must include information on not only the amount of phosphate but also the source of protein from which the phosphate derives
