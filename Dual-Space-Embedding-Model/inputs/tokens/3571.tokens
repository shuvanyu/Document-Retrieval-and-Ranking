recently it has been suggested that the escherichia coli causing urinary tract infection uti may come from meat and animalsthe purpose was to investigate if a clonal link existed between e coli from animals meat and uti patientstwentytwo geographically and temporally matched b2 e coli from uti patients communitydwelling humans broiler chicken meat pork and broiler chicken previously identified to exhibit eight virulence genotypes by microarraydetection of approximately 300 genes were investigated for clonal relatedness by pfgenine isolates were selected and tested for in vivo virulence in the mouse model of ascending utiuti and communitydwelling human strains were closely clonally related to meat strainsseveral human derived strains were also clonally interrelatedall nine isolates regardless of origin were virulent in the uti model with positive urine bladder and kidney culturesfurther isolates with the same gene profile also yielded similar bacterial counts in urine bladder and kidneysthis study showed a clonal link between e coli from meat and humans providing solid evidence that uti is zoonosisthe close relationship between communitydwelling human and uti isolates may indicate a point source spread egthrough contaminated meat
