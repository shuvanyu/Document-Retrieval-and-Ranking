aims coronary heart disease chd is a leading cause of death among men and women globallywomen develop chd about 10 years later than men yet the reasons for this are unclearthe purpose of this report is to determine if differences in risk factor distributions exist between women and men across various age categories to help explain why women develop acute mi later than menmethods and results we used the interheart global casecontrol study including 27 098 participants from 52 countries 6787 of whom were womenthe median age of first acute mi was higher in women than men 65 vs 56 years p  00001nine modifiable risk factors were associated with mi in women and menhypertension 295266 328 vs 232216248 diabetes 426368494 vs 267243294 physical activity 048041057 vs 077071083 and moderate alcohol use 041034050 vs 088082094 were more strongly associated with mi among women than menthe association of abnormal lipids current smoking abdominal obesity high risk diet and psychosocial stress factors with mi was similar in women and menrisk factors associations were generally stronger among younger individuals compared to older women and menthe population attributable risk par of all nine risk factors exceeded 94 and was similar among women and men 96 vs 93men were significantly more likely to suffer a mi prior to 60 years of age than were women however after adjusting for levels of risk factors the sex difference in the probability of mi cases occurring before the age of 60 years was reduced by more than 80conclusion women experience their first acute mi on average 9 years later than mennine modifiable risk factors are significantly associated with acute mi in both men and women and explain greater than 90 of the parthe difference in age of first mi is largely explained by the higher risk factor levels at younger ages in men compared to women
