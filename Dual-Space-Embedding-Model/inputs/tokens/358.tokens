the response to arterial wall injury is an inflammatory process which over time becomes integral to the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent plaque instabilityhowever the underlying injurious agent critical to this process has not received much attentionin this review a model of plaque rupture is hypothesized with two stages of inflammatory activityin stage i cholesterol crystalinduced cell injury and apoptosis intracellular cholesterol crystals induce foam cell apoptosis setting up a vicious cycle by signaling more macrophages resulting in accumulation of extra cellular lipidsthis local inflammation eventually leads to the formation of a semiliquid lipidrich necrotic core of a vulnerable plaquein stage ii cholesterol crystalinduced arterial wall injury the saturated lipid core is now primed for crystallization which can manifest as a clinical syndrome with a systemic inflammation responsecholesterol crystallization is the trigger that causes core expansion leading to intimal injurywe recently demonstrated that when cholesterol crystallizes from a liquid to a solid state it undergoes volume expansion which can tear the plaque capthis observation of cholesterol crystals perforating the cap and intimal surface was made in the plaques of patients who died with acute coronary syndromewe have also demonstrated that several agents ie statins aspirin and ethanol can dissolve cholesterol crystals and may be exerting their immediate benefits by this direct mechanismalso because recent studies have demonstrated that highsensitivity creactive protein may be a reliable marker in selecting patients for statin therapy it could reflect the presence of intimal injury by cholesterol crystalsthis was demonstrated in an atherosclerotic rabbit modeltherefore we propose that cholesterol crystallization could help explain in part both local and systemic inflammation associated with atherosclerosiscopyright  2010 national lipid associationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
