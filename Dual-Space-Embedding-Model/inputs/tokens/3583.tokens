phytoestrogens have been linked to a risk of breast cancerthe main phytoestrogens in the finnish diet are lignans and enterolactone is quantitatively the most important circulating lignanthe purpose of this study was to examine the association between serum enterolactone and risk of breast cancer in finnish womenthe subjects were participants of the kuopio breast cancer study this analysis concerns 194 breast cancer cases 68 premenopausal and 126 postmenopausal who entered the study before diagnosis and 208 communitybased controlsthey completed a validated food frequency questionnaire referring to the previous 12 months and gave serum samples before the examinationsthe measurement of serum enterolactone was performed by timeresolved fluoroimmunoassaythe statistical analyses were done by the logistic regression methodthe mean serum enterolactone concentration was 20 nmoll for the cases and 26 nmoll for the controls p 0003the mean serum enterolactone concentration in the lowest quintile was 30 nmoll and 540 nmoll in the highestthe odds ratio in the highest quintile of enterolactone values adjusted for all of the known risk factors for breast cancer was 038 95 confidence interval018077 p for trend 003the inverse association between serum enterolactone and risk of breast cancer was seen both among premenopausal and postmenopausal womenhigh enterolactone level was associated with higher consumption of rye products and tea and higher intake of dietary fiber and vitamin e compared with those with low serum enterolactone valuesserum enterolactone level was significantly inversely associated with risk of breast cancer
