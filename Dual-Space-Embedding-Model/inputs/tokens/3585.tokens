we used the nationwide swedish familycancer database to analyze cancer risks in swedenborn descendants of immigrants from european and north american countriesour study included close to 600000 066yearold descendants of an immigrant father or motherwe calculated standardized incidence ratios sirs and 95 confidence intervals cis for 17 cancer sites using native swedes as a referenceall cancer was marginally below the swedish incidence in offspring of immigrant origindecreased sirs were observed for breast cancer among norwegian descendants melanoma among descendants of hungarian fathers and ovarian and bladder cancer among descendents of finnish mothers all consistent with the difference in cancer incidence between swedes and the indigenous populationscervical cancer was increased in daughters of danish men whereas thyroid cancer and nonhodgkins lymphoma were in excess in offspring of parents of yugoslav and asian descenteven these results agreed with the high incidence rates in parents compared to swedes except that for nonhodgkins lymphoma other explanations are needed these may be related to immune malfunctioncomparison of the results between the first and the secondgeneration immigrants suggest that the first 2 decades of life are important in setting the pattern for cancer development in subsequent lifebirth in sweden sets the swedish pattern for cancer incidence irrespective of the nationality of descent while entering sweden in the 20s is already too late to influence the environmentally imprinted program for the cancer destinycopyright 2002 wileyliss inc
