this review focuses on the possible role in human health of the consumption of lignanrich foodsmost of the plant lignans in human foods are converted by the intestinal microflora in the upper part of the large bowel to enterolactone and enterodiol called mammalian or enterolignansthe protective role of these compounds particularly in chronic western diseases is discussedevidence suggests that fiber and lignanrich wholegrain cereals beans berries nuts and various seeds are the main protective foodsmany factors in addition to diet such as intestinal microflora smoking antibiotics and obesity affect circulating lignan levels in the bodylignanrich diets may be beneficial particularly if consumed for lifeexperimental evidence in animals has shown clear anticarcinogenic effects of flaxseed or pure lignans in many types of cancermany epidemiological results are controversial partly because the determinants of plasma enterolactone are very different in different countriesthe source of the lignans seems to play a role because other factors in the food obviously participate in the protective effectsthe results are promising but much work is still needed in this area of medicine
