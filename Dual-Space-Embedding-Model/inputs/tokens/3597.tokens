depression is a medical condition with a complex biological pattern of aetiology involving genetic and epigenetic factors along with different environmental stressorsrecent evidence suggests that oxidative stress processes might play a relevant role in the pathogenic mechanisms underlying many major psychiatric disorders including depressionreactive oxygen and nitrogen species have been shown to modulate levels and activity of noradrenaline norepinephrine serotonin dopamine and glutamate the principal neurotransmitters involved in the neurobiology of depressionmajor depression has been associated with lowered concentrations of several endogenous antioxidant compounds such as vitamin e zinc and coenzyme q10 or enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and with an impairment of the total antioxidant statusthese observations introduce new potential targets for the development of therapeutic interventions based on antioxidant compoundsthe present review focuses on the possible role of oxidative stress processes in the pathogenesis of depressionthe therapeutic potential of antioxidant compounds as a coadjuvant treatment to conventional antidepressants is discussedfor instance nacetylcysteine has been shown to have a significant benefit on depressive symptoms in a randomized placebocontrolled trialadditionally curcumin the yellow pigment of curry has been shown to strongly interfere with neuronal redox homeostasis in the cns and to possess antidepressant activity in various animal models of depression also thanks to its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidasesthere is an urgent need to develop better tolerated and more effective treatments for depressive disorders and several antioxidant treatments appear promising and deserve further study
