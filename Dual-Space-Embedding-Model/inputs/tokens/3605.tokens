background vanillin is responsible for the flavor and smell of vanilla a widely used flavoring agentprevious studies showed that vanillin could enhance the repair of mutations and thus function as an antimutagenhowever its role in cancer a disease that is closely related to mutation has not yet been fully elucidatedmethods hence this study investigated the cytolytic and cytostatic properties of vanillin against ht29 a human colorectal cancer cell linemethods used including cell viability assay acridine orange aoethidium bromide eb double staining cell morphological analysis cell cycle analysis annexin vpropidium iodide apoptosis test and 5bromo2deoxyuridine brdulabeling cell proliferation assayresults results showed that apoptosis was induced by vanillin and the ic50 for ht29 and nih3t3 normal cell lines were 400 microgml and 1000 microgml respectivelydifferent concentrations of vanillin arrest cell cycle at different checkpoints5bromo2deoxyuridinelabeling cell proliferation assay showed that g0g1 arrest was achieved at lower concentration of vanillin 200 microgml while cell cycle analysis by flow cytometer showed that g2m arrest occurs at higher concentration of vanillin 1000 microgmlconclusion cytolytic and cytostatic effects shown by vanillin showed that it could be a useful colorectal cancer preventive agentfurther in vivo study should be carried out to confirm that similar effects could happen in animals
