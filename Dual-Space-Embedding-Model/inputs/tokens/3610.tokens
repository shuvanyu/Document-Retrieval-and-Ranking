wild rice grain samples from various parts of the world have been found to have elevated concentrations of heavy metals raising concern for potential effects on human healthit was hypothesized that wild rice from northcentral wisconsin could potentially have elevated concentrations of some heavy metals because of possible exposure to these elements from the atmosphere or from water and sedimentsin addition no studies of heavy metals in wild rice from wisconsin had been performed and a baseline study was needed for future comparisonswild rice plants were collected from four areas in bayfield forest langlade oneida sawyer and wood counties in september 1997 and 1998 and divided into four plant parts for elemental analyses roots stems leaves and seedsa total of 194 samples from 51 plants were analyzed across the localities with an average of 49 samples per part depending on the elementsamples were cleaned of soil wet digested and analyzed by icp for ag as cd cr cu hg mg pb se and znroots contained the highest concentrations of ag as cd cr hg pb and secopper was highest in both roots and seeds while zn was highest just in seedsmagnesium was highest in leavesseed baseline ranges for the 10 elements were established using the 95 confidence intervals of the medianswild rice plants from northern wisconsin had normal levels of the nutritional elements cu mg and zn in the seedssilver cd hg cr and se were very low in concentration or within normal limits for food plantsarsenic and pb however were elevated and could pose a problem for human healththe pathway for as hg and pb to the plants could be atmospheric
