saffron dried stigmas of crocus sativus l has been used as a spice food colorant and medicinal plant for millenniain this study cytotoxic effect of saffron extract was evaluated in hepg2 and hela cell linesmeanwhile role of apoptosis and ros were exploredmalignant and nonmalignant cells l929 were cultured in dmem medium and incubated with different concentrations of ethanolic saffron extractcell viability was quantitated by mtt assayapoptotic cells were determined using pi staining of dna fragmentation by flow cytometry subg1 peakros was measured using dcfda by flow cytometry analysissaffron could decrease cell viability in malignant cells as a concentration and timedependent mannerthe ic50 values against hela and hepg2 were determined 800 and 950 microgml after 48 h respectivelysaffron induced a subg1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells compared to control indicating apoptotic cell death is involved in saffron toxicitythis toxicity was also independent of ros productionit might be concluded that saffron could cause cell death in hela and hepg2 cells in which apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an important rolesaffron could be also considered as a promising chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment in future
