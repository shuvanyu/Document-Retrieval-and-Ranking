clostridium difficile infections cdis are traditionally seen in elderly and hospitalized patients who have used antibiotic therapyin the community cdis requiring a visit to a general practitioner are increasingly occurring among young and relatively healthy individuals without known predisposing factorsc difficile is also found as a commensal or pathogen in the intestinal tracts of most mammals and various birds and reptilesin the environment including soil and water c difficile may be ubiquitous however this is based on limited evidencefood products such as processed meat fish and vegetables can also contain c difficile but studies conducted in europe report lower prevalence rates than in north americaabsolute counts of toxigenic c difficile in the environment and food are low however the exact infectious dose is unknownto date direct transmission of c difficile from animals food or the environment to humans has not been proven although similar pcr ribotypes are foundwe therefore believe that the overall epidemiology of human cdi is not driven by amplification in animals or other sourcesas no outbreaks of cdi have been reported among humans in the community host factors that increase vulnerability to cdi might be of more importance than increased exposure to c difficileconversely emerging c difficile ribotype 078 is found in high numbers in piglets calves and their immediate environmentalthough there is no direct evidence proving transmission to humans circumstantial evidence points towards a zoonotic potential of this typein future emerging pcr ribotypes zoonotic potential needs to be considered 2012 the authorsclinical microbiology and infection  2012 european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases
