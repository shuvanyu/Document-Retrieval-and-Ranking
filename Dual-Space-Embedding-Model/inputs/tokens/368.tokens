there has been a recent increase in communityassociated infections linked to methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and clostridium difficileit is established that both pathogens can be recovered from retail pork although it is unclear to what degree contamination is acquired at the farm in comparison to that acquired during processingto address this gap the following study reports on the carriage of mrsa and c difficile on pigs from birth through to the end of processingc difficile was isolated from 28 93 of 30 pigs at 1 day of age but prevalence declined sharply to 1 of 26 by market age 188 daysmrsa prevalence peaked at 74 days of age with 19 68 of 28 pigs testing positive but declined to 3 of 26 at 150 days of age with no pig being detected as positive at market ageat the processing facility c difficile was isolated from the holding area with a single carcass testing positive for the pathogen at preeviscerationmrsa was primarily isolated from nasal swabs with 8 31 carcasses testing positive at postbleed which increased to 14 54 positive at postscald tanksonly one carcass sampled at postbleed tested positive for mrsa with no recovery of the pathogen from environmental samples takenc difficile ribotype 078 predominated in the longitudinal portion of the study accounting for all of the 68 isolates recovered from pigsonly three c difficile isolates which were identified as ribotype 078 were recovered at the slaughterhousemrsa spa type 539 t034 predominated in pigs on the farm and samples taken at the slaughterhouse accounting for 80 of all isolates recoveredthe study demonstrated that both c difficile and mrsa acquired on the farm can be transferred through to processing although no evidence for significant crosscontamination between carcasses or the slaughterhouse environment was evident
