during the slaughter process cattle carcasses are split by sawing centrally down the vertebral column resulting in contamination of each half with spinal cord materialusing a novel method based on a realtime pcr assay we measured sawmediated tissue transfer among carcassesup to 25 of the tissue recovered from each of the five subsequent carcasses by swabbing the split vertebral face came from the first carcass to be split approximately 9 mg was spinal cord tissueunder controlled conditions in an experimental abattoir between 23 and 135 g of tissue accumulated in the saw after splitting five to eight carcassesof the total tissue recovered between 10 and 15 originated from the first carcass and between 7 and 61 mg was spinal cord tissue from the first carcassat commercial plants in the united kingdom between 6 and 101 g of tissue was recovered from the saw depending on the particular sawwashing procedure and number of carcasses processedtherefore if a carcass infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy were to enter the slaughter line the main risk of subsequent carcass contamination would come from the tissue debris that accumulates in the splitting sawthis work highlights the importance of effective saw cleaning and indicates that design modifications are required to minimize the accumulation of spinal cord tissue debris and hence the risk of crosscontamination of carcasses
