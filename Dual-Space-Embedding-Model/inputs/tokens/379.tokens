background  aims this research was aimed at clarifying whether high dietary fiber intake has an impact on incidence and risk of stroke at a population levelmethods in 1647 unselected subjects dietary fiber intake dfi was detected in a 12year populationbased study using other dietary variables anagraphics biometrics blood pressure heart rate blood lipids glucose insulin uricaemia fibrinogenaemia erytrosedimentation rate diabetes insulin resistance smoking pulmonary disease and left ventricular hypertrophy as covariablesresults in adjusted cox models high dfi reduced the risk of strokein analysis based on quintiles of fiber intake adjusted for confounders hr for incidence of stroke was lower when the daily intake of soluble fiber was 25 g or that of insoluble fiber was 47 g in multivariate analyses using these values as cutoff of dfi the risk of stroke was lower in those intaking more that the cutoff of soluble hr 031 017055 or insoluble hr 035 019063 fiberincidence of stroke was also lower 50 p  0003 and 46 p  001 respectivelyconclusions higher dietary dfi is inversely and independently associated to incidence and risk of stroke in general populationcopyright  2012 elsevier ltd and european society for clinical nutrition and metabolismall rights reserved
