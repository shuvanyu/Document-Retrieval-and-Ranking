the worldwide increase of antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms complicates medical treatment of infected humanswe did a riskfactor analysis for the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant campylobacter coli on 64 swiss pig finishing farmsbetween may and november 2001 20 faecal samples per farm were collected from the floor of pens holding finishing pigs shortly before slaughtersamples were pooled and cultured for campylobacter speciesisolated campylobacter strains were tested for resistance against selected antimicrobialsadditionally information on herd health and management aspects was available from another studybecause data quality on the history of antimicrobial use on the farms was poor only nonantimicrobial risk factors could be analysedstatistical analyses were performed for resistance against ciprofloxacin erythromycin streptomycin tetracycline and for multiple resistance which was defined as resistance to three or more antimicrobialsrisk factors for these outcomescorrected for dependency of samples at herd levelwere analysed in five generalised estimationequation modelsprevalence of antimicrobial resistance among campylobacter isolates was ciprofloxacin 261 erythromycin 192 streptomycin 780 tetracycline 94 and multiple resistance 65important risk factors contributing to the prevalence of resistant strains were shortened tails lameness skin lesions feed without whey and ad libitum feedingmultiple resistance was more likely in farms which only partially used an allinallout system or  37 or a continuousflow system or  3 compared to a strict allinallout animalflowpresence of lameness or  25 illthrift or  15 and scratches at the shoulder or  5 in the herd also increased the odds for multiple resistancethis study showed that on finishing farms which maintained a good herd health status and optimal farm management the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was also more favourable
