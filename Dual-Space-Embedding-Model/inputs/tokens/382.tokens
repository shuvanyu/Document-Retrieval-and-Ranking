the metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes can be reversed reproducibly by bariatric surgeryby quantifying the major pathophysiological abnormalities in insulin secretion and insulin action after surgery the sequence of events leading to restoration of normal metabolism can be definedliver fat levels fall within days and normal hepatic insulin sensitivity is restoredsimultaneously plasma glucose levels return towards normalinsulin sensitivity of muscle remains abnormal at least over the weeks and months after bariatric surgerythe effect of the surgery is explicable solely in terms of energy restrictionby combining this information with prospective observation of the changes immediately preceding the onset of type 2 diabetes a clear picture emergesinsulin resistance in muscle caused by inherited and environmental factors facilitates the development of fatty liver during positive energy balanceonce established the increased insulin secretion required to maintain plasma glucose levels will further increase liver fat depositionfatty liver causes resistance to insulin suppression of hepatic glucose output as well as raised plasma triacylglycerolexposure of beta cells to increased levels of fatty acids derived from circulating and locally deposited triacylglycerol suppresses glucosemediated insulin secretionthis is reversible initially but eventually becomes permanentthe essential time sequence of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is now evidentmuscle insulin resistance determines the rate at which fatty liver progresses and ectopic fat deposition in liver and islet underlies the related dynamic defects of hepatic insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunctionthese defects are capable of dramatic reversal under hypoenergetic feeding conditions completely in early diabetes and to a worthwhile extent in more established disease
