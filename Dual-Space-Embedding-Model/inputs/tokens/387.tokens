background recently two centers have independently developed a risk score for predicting postoperative nausea and vomiting ponvthis study investigated 1 whether risk scores are valid across centers and 2 whether risk scores based on logistic regression coefficients can be simplified without loss of discriminating powermethods adult patients from two centers oulu finland n  520 and wuerzburg germany n  2202 received inhalational anesthesia without antiemetic prophylaxis for various types of surgeryponv was defined as nausea or vomiting within 24 h of surgeryrisk scores to estimate the probability of ponv were obtained by fitting logistic regression modelssimplified risk scores were constructed based on the number of risk factors that were found significant in the logistic regression analysesoriginal and simplified scores were crossvalidateda combined data set was created to estimate a potential center effect and to construct a final risk scorethe discriminating power of each score was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curvesresults risk scores derived from one center were able to predict ponv from the other center area under the curve  065075simplification did not essentially weaken the discriminating power area under the curve  063073no center effect could be detected in a combined data set odds ratio  106 95 confidence interval  071159the final score consisted of four predictors female gender history of motion sickness ms or ponv nonsmoking and the use of postoperative opioidsif none one two three or four of these risk factors were present the incidences of ponv were 10 21 39 61 and 79conclusions the risk scores derived from one center proved valid in the other and could be simplified without significant loss of discriminating powertherefore it appears that this risk score has broad applicability in predicting ponv in adult patients undergoing inhalational anesthesia for various types of surgeryfor patients with at least two out of these four identified predictors a prophylactic antiemetic strategy should be considered
