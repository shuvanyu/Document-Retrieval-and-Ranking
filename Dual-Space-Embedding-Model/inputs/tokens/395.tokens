the effect of plant and animal protein on blood lipid levels was investigated in eight healthy normolipidemic men aged 18 to 27 yr all subjects were fed both plant and animal protein diets in a crossover designeach diet was consumed for a 21day periodproteins from commonly used plant sources made up the plant protein dietbeef protein was substituted for 55 of the plant proteins in the animal protein dietfasting venous blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study and at 7day intervals throughout the 42day studyserum was analyzed for total cholesterol and triglyceridesplasma lowdensity and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol were determinedthere were not any statistically significant differences in mean serum total cholesterol or mean plasma lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol when subjects consumed the dietsmean plasma highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly p less than 005 elevated at the end of the 21day period when the animal protein diet was consumed 48  3 mgdl compared to the period when the plant protein diet was fed 42  2 mgdlmean serum triglyceride values were significantly p less than 005 increased at day 7 of the plant protein diet period 136  19 mgdl compared to the same time period when the animal protein diet was consumed 84  12 mgdlthe results of the study indicated that the ingestion of a diet in which 55 of the protein was supplied by beef protein was not associated with a hypercholesterolemic effect in healthy normolipidemic young men
