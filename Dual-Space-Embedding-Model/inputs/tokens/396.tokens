the effect of substituting soy for animal protein in mixed diets was determined in young men with mildly elevated plasma cholesterol 218 to 307 mgdlthe diets were low in cholesterol 200 mgday with 13 to 16 of energy as protein 30 to 35 as fat and a polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio of 05of protein 65 was from either mixed animal proteins or isolated soy protein products made comparable by the addition of extracted animal fatsfresh egg yolk was added to balance the cholesterol content of the dietsproteins from grains and vegetables were identical in both menus and contributed about 35 of dietary proteintwenty of 24 subjects decreased plasma cholesterol at the end of the protocolsubjects were classified as responders or nonresponders as a function of greater or lesser than mean reduction in cholesterol for the groupsmean decreases in plasma cholesterol 16 and 13 for responders in the animal and soy groups were significant p less than 001 and 005 respectivelyresponders in both groups had higher initial plasma cholesterol values than nonrespondersalthough plasma highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol decreased slightly the highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol to cholesterol ratio highdensity lipoprotein cholesteroltotal cholesterol remained constant for most individualsthe hypocholesterolemic effects were similar for both animal and soy protein p less than 005 and fat p less than 005 while on the experimental dietall groups significantly decreased dietary cholesterol p less than 0001
