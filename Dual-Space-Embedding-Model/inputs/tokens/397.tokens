objectives to investigate the effect of replacing lean meat with a soy product tofu on serum lipoprotein concentrationsstudy and design randomized crossover dietary intervention studysubjects fortytwo freeliving healthy males aged 3562 y completed the dietary interventionthree additional subjects were noncompliant and excluded prior to analysisinterventions a diet containing lean meat 150 gd was compared with one with 290 gd tofu in an isocaloric and isoprotein substitutionboth diet periods were 1 month and fat intake was carefully controlledresults sevenday diet records showed the two diets were similar in energy macronutrients and fibretotal cholesterol mean difference 023 mmoll 95 ci 002 043 p003 and triglycerides mean difference 015 mmoll 95 ci 002 031 p0017 were significantly lower on the tofu diet than the lean meat diethowever hdlc was also significantly lower on the tofu diet mean difference 008 mmoll 95 ci 002 014 p001 although the ldlchdlc ratio was similarconclusion the effect on hdlc and the small ldlc reduction differ from some other studies where fat was often less controlled and the comparison was of soy as textured protein or soymilk against caseinthis suggests a differential effect of the various proteins compared to the soy may influence the findingsin practice the replacement of meat with tofu would usually be associated with a decrease in saturated fat and an increase in polyunsaturated fat and this should enhance any small benefits due to the soy proteinsponsor deakin university with some contribution from a commonwealth department of veterans affairs research granteuropean journal of clinical nutrition 2000 54 1419
