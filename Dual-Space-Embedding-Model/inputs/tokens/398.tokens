objective to investigate the effect of replacing lean meat with a soy product tofu on coronary heart disease risk factors including serum lipoproteins lipoprotein a factor vii fibrinogen and in vitro susceptibility of ldl to oxidationdesign a randomized cross over dietary intervention studysetting freeliving individuals studied at deakin universitysubjects fortyfive freeliving healthy males aged 35 to 62 years completed the dietary interventionthree subjects were noncompliant and excluded prior to analysisinterventions a diet containing 150 grams of lean meat per day was compared to a diet containing 290 grams of tofu per day in an isocaloric and isoprotein substitutioneach dietary period was one month durationresults analysis of the sevenday diet record showed that diets were similar in energy protein carbohydrate total fat saturated and unsaturated fat polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio alcohol and fibertotal cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly lower and in vitro ldl oxidation lag phase was significantly longer on the tofu diet compared to the meat dietthe hemostatic factors factor vii and fibrinogen and lipoproteina were not significantly affected by the tofu dietconclusions the increase in ldl oxidation lag phase would be expected to be associated with a decrease in coronary heart disease risk
