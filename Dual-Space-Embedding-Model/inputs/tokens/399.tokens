background limited consumption of red meat including beef is one of many oftensuggested strategies to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease chdhowever the role that beef consumption specifically plays in promoting adverse changes in the cardiovascular risk factor profile is unclearobjective a metaanalysis of randomized controlled clinical trials rcts was conducted to evaluate the effects of beef independent of other red and processed meats compared with poultry andor fish consumption on lipoprotein lipidsmethods rcts published from 1950 to 2010 were considered for inclusionstudies were included if they reported fasting lipoprotein lipid changes after beef and poultryfish consumption by subjects free of chronic diseasea total of 124 rcts were identified and 8 studies involving 406 subjects met the prespecified entry criteria and were included in the analysisresults relative to the baseline diet mean  standard error changes in mgdl after beef versus poultryfish consumption respectively were 81  28 vs 62  31 for total cholesterol p  630 82  42 vs 89  44 for lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol p  905 23  10 vs 19  08 for highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol p  762 and 81  36 vs 129  40 mgdl for triacylglycerols p  367conclusion changes in the fasting lipid profile were not significantly different with beef consumption compared with those with poultry andor fish consumptioninclusion of lean beef in the diet increases the variety of available food choices which may improve longterm adherence with dietary recommendations for lipid managementcopyright  2012 national lipid associationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
