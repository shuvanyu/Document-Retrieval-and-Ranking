reductions in lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol ldlc result from diets containing almonds or diets that are either low in saturated fat or high in viscous fibers soy proteins or plant sterolswe have therefore combined all of these interventions in a single diet portfolio diet to determine whether cholesterol reductions could be achieved of similar magnitude to those reported in recent statin trials which reduced cardiovascular eventstwentyfive hyperlipidemic subjects consumed either a portfolio diet n13 very low in saturated fat and high in plant sterols 12 g1000 kcal soy protein 162 g1000 kcal viscous fibers 83 g1000 kcal and almonds 166 g1000 kcal or a lowsaturated fat diet n12 based on wholewheat cereals and lowfat dairy foodsfasting blood blood pressure and body weight were obtained at weeks 0 2 and 4 of each phaseldlc was reduced by 121  24 p001 on the lowfat diet and by 350  31 p001 on the portfolio diet which also reduced the ratio of ldlc to highdensity lipoproteincholesterol hdlc significantly 300  35 p001the reductions in ldlc and the ldlhdlc ratio were both significantly lower on the portfolio diet than on the control diet p001 and p001 respectivelymean weight loss was similar on test and control diets 10 kg and 09 kg respectivelyno difference was seen in blood pressure hdlc serum triglycerides lipoproteina lpa or homocysteine concentrations between dietscombining a number of foods and food components in a single dietary portfolio may lower ldlc similarly to statins and so increase the potential effectiveness of dietary therapy
