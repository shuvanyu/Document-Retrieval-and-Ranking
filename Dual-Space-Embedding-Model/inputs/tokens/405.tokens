determination of the environmental factors involved in neurodegenerative diseases has been elusivemethylmercury and βnmethylaminolalanine bmaa have both been implicated in this roleexposure of primary cortical cultures to these compounds independently induced concentrationdependent neurotoxicityimportantly concentrations of bmaa 10100 μm that caused no toxicity alone potentiated methylmercury 3 μm toxicityin addition concentrations of bmaa and methylmercury that had no effect by themselves on the main cellular antioxidant glutathione together decreased glutathione levelsfurthermore the combined toxicity of methylmercury and bmaa was attenuated by the cell permeant form of glutathione glutathione monoethyl esterthe results indicate a synergistic toxic effect of the environmental neurotoxins bmaa and methylmercury and that the interaction is at the level of glutathione depletion
