background dietary exposure to the cyanotoxin bmaa is suspected to be the cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the western pacific islandsin europe and north america this toxin has been identified in the marine environment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clusters but to date only few dietary exposures have been describedobjectives we aimed at identifying clusters of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the hérault district a coastal district from southern france and to search in the identified areas for the existence of a potential dietary source of bmaamethods a spatiotemporal cluster analysis was performed in the district considering all incident amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases identified from 1994 to 2009 by our expert centerwe investigated the cluster area with serial collections of oysters and mussels that were subsequently analyzed blind for bmaa concentrationsresults we found one significant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cluster p  00024 surrounding the thau lagoon the most important area of shellfish production and consumption along the french mediterranean coastbmaa was identified in mussels 18 µgg to 60 µgg and oysters 06 µgg to 16 µggthe highest concentrations of bmaa were measured during summer when the highest picocyanobacteria abundances were recordedconclusions while it is not possible to ascertain a direct link between shellfish consumption and the existence of this als cluster these results add new data to the potential association of bmaa with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis one of the most severe neurodegenerative disorder
