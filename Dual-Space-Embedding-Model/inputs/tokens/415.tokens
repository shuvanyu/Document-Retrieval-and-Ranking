the association of αaminoβmethylaminopropionic acid bmaa with elevated incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosisparkinsons disease complex alspdc was first identified on the island of guambmaa has been shown to be produced across the cyanobacterial order and its detection has been reported in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments worldwide suggesting that it is ubiquitousvarious in vivo studies on rats mice chicks and monkeys have shown that it can cause neurodegenerative symptoms such as ataxia and convulsionszebrafish research has also shown disruption to neural development after bmaa exposurein vitro studies on mice rats and leeches have shown that bmaa acts predominantly on motor neuronsobserved increases in the generation of reactive oxygen species ros and ca2 influx coupled with disruption to mitochondrial activity and general neuronal death indicate that the main mode of activity is via excitotoxic mechanismsthe current review pertaining to the neurotoxicity of bmaa clearly demonstrates its ability to adversely affect neural tissues and implicates it as a potentially significant compound in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseasewhen considering the potential adverse health effects upon exposure to this compound further research to better understand the modes of toxicity of bmaa and the environmental exposure limits is essential
