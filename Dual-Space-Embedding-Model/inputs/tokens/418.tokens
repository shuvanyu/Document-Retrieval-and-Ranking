the calcium ion ca2 is a ubiquitous second messenger that is crucial for the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processesthe diverse transient signals transduced by ca2 are mediated by intracellular ca2binding proteins also known as ca2 sensorsa key obstacle to studying many ca2sensing proteins is the difficulty in identifying the numerous downstream target interactions that respond to ca2induced conformational changesamong a number of ca2 sensors in the eukaryotic cell calmodulin cam is the most widespread and the best studiedemploying the mrna display technique we have scanned the human proteome for cambinding proteins and have identified and characterized a large number of both known and previously uncharacterized proteins that interact with cam in a ca2dependent mannerthe interactions of several identified proteins with ca2cam were confirmed by using pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitationmany of the cambinding proteins identified belong to protein families such as the deadh box proteins ribosomal proteins proteasome 26s subunits and deubiquitinating enzymes suggesting the possible involvement of ca2cam in different signaling pathwaysthe selection method described herein could be used to identify the binding partners of other calcium sensors on the proteomewide scale
