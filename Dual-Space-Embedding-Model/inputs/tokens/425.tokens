as root symbionts of cycad trees cyanobacteria of the genus nostoc produce Î²methylaminolalanine bmaa a neurotoxic nonprotein amino acidthe biomagnification of bmaa through the guam ecosystem fits a classic triangle of increasing concentrations of toxic compounds up the food chainhowever because bmaa is polar and nonlipophilic a mechanism for its biomagnification through increasing trophic levels has been unclearwe report that bmaa occurs not only as a free amino acid in the guam ecosystem but also can be released from a bound form by acid hydrolysisafter first removing free amino acids from tissue samples of various trophic levels cyanobacteria root symbioses cycad seeds cycad flour flying foxes eaten by the chamorro people and brain tissues of chamorros who died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosisparkinsonism dementia complex we then hydrolyzed the remaining fraction and found bmaa concentrations increased 10 to 240foldthis bound form of bmaa may function as an endogenous neurotoxic reservoir accumulating and being transported between trophic levels and subsequently being released during digestion and protein metabolismwithin brain tissues the endogenous neurotoxic reservoir can slowly release free bmaa thereby causing incipient and recurrent neurological damage over years or even decades which may explain the observed long latency period for neurological disease onset among the chamorro peoplethe presence of bmaa in brain tissues from canadian patients who died of alzheimers disease suggests that exposure to cyanobacterial neurotoxins occurs outside of guam
