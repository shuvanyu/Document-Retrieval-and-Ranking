there is significant interest in the use of mushrooms andor mushroom extracts as dietary supplements based on theories that they enhance immune function and promote healthto some extent select mushrooms have been shown to have stimulatory action on immune responsiveness particularly when studied in vitrohowever despite their widespread use for potential health benefits there is a surprising paucity of epidemiologic and experimental studies that address the biologic activities of mushrooms after oral administration to animals or humansthere have been a number of studies that have addressed the ability of mushrooms to modulate mononuclear cell activation and the phenotypic expression of cytokines and their cognate receptorsthere have also been a number of attempts to determine antitumor activities of mushroomssuch studies are important because many of the components of mushrooms do potentially have significant biologic activityall data however should be tempered by the possibility that there are toxic levels of metals including arsenic lead cadmium and mercury as well as the presence of radioactive contamination with 137csin this review we will present the comparative biology with respect to both immunological and antitumor activities of mushroom extracts and also highlight the need for further evidencebased research
