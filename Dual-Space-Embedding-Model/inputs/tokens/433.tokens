obesityinduced insulin resistance has been suggested to be a systemic inflammatory condition with activation of the innate immune systemanimal studies indicate that certain dietary fibers such as 1316betadglycans bdg have potent effects on immune activity such as increasing the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin10 il10 and reducing the secretion of inflammatory factorstherefore we hypothesized that bdg consumption improves inflammatory markers and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese subjects with moderately increased levels of creactive protein indicating subclinical inflammationwe screened 180 overweight and obese subjects for moderately increased creactive protein levels on 2 or more occasions in the absence of any signs of acute infectiontwelve of the subjects met all inclusion criteria and were investigated in a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover design for 2 x 4 weeks washout  or 4 weekssubjects ingested capsules containing 3 x 05 g of highly purified bdg or 3 x 05 g of placebo waxy maize starch dailymaintenance of the normal diet of the participants and the correct intake of the capsules were monitored using 6 x 3day food recording and counting of the provided capsulespredefined outcome measures were bdginduced changes in pro and antiinflammatory markers in circulating blood and gene expression in adipose tissue and peripheral insulin sensitivity expressed as m valuethe bdg consumption for 4 weeks significantly increased both circulating levels and adipose tissue messenger rna mrna expression of the antiinflammatory cytokine il10 in overweight and obese humansinsulin sensitivity as well as circulating levels and mrna expression of proinflammatory cytokines were unaffected by bdg treatmentincreased il10 after bdg consumption might be a contributing factor to the known beneficial effects of dietary fiber intake
