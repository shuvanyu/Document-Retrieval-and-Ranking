this viewpoint aims to 1 review the available scientific literature on the relationship between whole grain consumption and body weight regulation 2 evaluate the potential mechanisms whereby whole grain intake may help reduce overweight and 3 try to understand why epidemiological studies and clinical trials provide diverging results on this topicall the prospective epidemiological studies demonstrate that a higher intake of whole grains is associated with lower bmi and body weight gainhowever these results do not clarify whether whole grain consumption is simply a marker of a healthier lifestyle or a factor favoring per se lower body weighthabitual whole grain consumption seems to cause lower body weight by multiple mechanisms such as lower energy density of whole grain based products lower glycemic index fermentation of non digestible carbohydrates satiety signals and finally by modulating intestinal microflorain contrast with epidemiological evidence the results of few clinical trials do not confirm that a whole grain lowcalorie diet is more effective in reducing body weight than a refined cereal diet but their results may have been affected by small sample size or short duration of the interventiontherefore further intervention studies with adequate methodology are needed to clarify this questionfor the time being whole grain consumption can be recommended as one of the features of the diet that may help control body weight but also because is associated with a lower risk to develop type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and cancercopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
