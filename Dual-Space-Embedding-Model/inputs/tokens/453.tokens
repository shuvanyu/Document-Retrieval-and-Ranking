context because of a different degree of processing and nutrient contents brown rice and white rice may have different effects on risk of type 2 diabetesobjective to prospectively examine white rice and brown rice consumptions in relation to type 2 diabetes risk in us men and women aged 2687 yr design and setting the health professionals followup study 19862006 and the nurses health study i 19842006 and ii 19912005participants we prospectively ascertained diet lifestyle practices and disease status among 39765 men and 157463 women in these cohortsall participants were free of diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer at baselineintake of white rice brown rice other foods and nutrients was assessed at baseline and updated every 24 yearsresults during 3318196 personyears of followup we documented 10507 incident cases of type 2 diabetesafter multivariate adjustment for age and other lifestyle and dietary risk factors higher intake of white rice was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetesthe pooled relative risk 95 confidence interval of type 2 diabetes comparing 5 servingsweek with 1 servingmonth of white rice was 117 102 136in contrast high brown rice intake was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes the pooled multivariate relative risk 95 confidence interval was 089 081 097 for  2 servingsweek of brown rice as compared with 1 servingmonthwe estimated that replacing 50 gramsday cooked equivalent to â…“ servingday intake of white rice with the same amount of brown rice was associated with a 16 95 confidence interval 9 21 lower risk of type 2 diabetes whereas the same replacement with whole grains as a group was associated with a 36 95 confidence interval 30 42 lower diabetes riskconclusions substitution of whole grains including brown rice for white rice may lower risk of type 2 diabetesthese data support the recommendation that most carbohydrate intake should come from whole grains rather than refined grains to facilitate the prevention of type 2 diabetes
