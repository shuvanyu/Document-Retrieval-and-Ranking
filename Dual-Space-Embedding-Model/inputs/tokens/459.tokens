wholegrain and high fiber intakes are routinely recommended for prevention of vascular diseases however there are no comprehensive and quantitative assessments of available data in humansthe aim of this study was to systematically examine longitudinal studies investigating wholegrain and fiber intake in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes t2d cardiovascular disease cvd weight gain and metabolic risk factorswe identified 45 prospective cohort studies and 21 randomizedcontrolled trials rct between 1966 and february 2012 by searching the cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature cochrane elsevier medical database and pubmedstudy characteristics wholegrain and dietary fiber intakes and risk estimates were extracted using a standardized protocolusing random effects models we found that compared with neverrare consumers of whole grains those consuming 4880 g whole graind 35 servingd had an 26 lower risk of t2d rr  074 95 ci 069 080 21 lower risk of cvd rr  079 95 ci 074 085 and consistently less weight gain during 813 y 127 vs 164 kg p  0001among rct weighted mean differences in postintervention circulating concentrations of fasting glucose and total and ldlcholesterol comparing wholegrain intervention groups with controls indicated significantly lower concentrations after wholegrain interventions differences in fasting glucose 093 mmoll 95 ci 165 021 total cholesterol 083 mmoll 123 042 and ldlcholesterol 082 mmoll 131 033corrected findings from this metaanalysis provide evidence to support beneficial effects of wholegrain intake on vascular disease preventionpotential mechanisms responsible for whole grains effects on metabolic intermediates require further investigation in large intervention trials
