background the definition of incident type 2 diabetes varies across studies hence the actual incidence of type 2 diabetes in japan is unclearhere we reviewed the various definitions of incident type 2 diabetes used in previous epidemiologic studies and estimated the diabetes incidence rate in japanmethods we searched for related literature in the medline embase and ichushi databases through september 2012two reviewers selected studies that evaluated incident type 2 diabetes in the japanese populationresults from 1824 relevant articles we included 33 studies with 386803 participantsthe followup period ranged from 23 to 14 years and the studies were initiated between 1980 and 2003the randomeffects model indicated that the pooled incidence rate of diabetes was 88 95 confidence interval 74104 per 1000 personyearswe observed a high degree of heterogeneity in the results i2  992 p  0001 with incidence rates ranging from 23 to 526 per 1000 personyearsthree studies based their definition of incident type 2 diabetes on selfreports only 10 on laboratory data only and 20 on selfreports and laboratory datacompared with studies defining diabetes using laboratory data n  30 pooled incidence rate  96 95 confidence interval  83111 studies based on selfreports alone tended to show a lower incidence rate n  3 pooled incidence rate  40 95 confidence interval  3250 p for interaction  0001however stratified analyses could not entirely explain the heterogeneity in the resultsconclusions our systematic review and metaanalysis indicated the presence of a high degree of heterogeneity which suggests that there is a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the incidence of type 2 diabetes in japanthey also suggested that laboratory data may be important for the accurate estimation of the incidence of type 2 diabetes
