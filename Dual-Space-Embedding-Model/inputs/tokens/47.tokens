the doubleblind randomized controlled trial rct is accepted by medicine as objective scientific methodology that when ideally performed produces knowledge untainted by biasthe validity of the rct rests not just on theoretical arguments but also on the discrepancy between the rct and less rigorous evidence the difference is sometimes considered an objective measure of biasa brief overview of historical and recent developments in the discrepancy argument is presentedthe article then examines the possibility that some of this deviation from truth may be the result of artifacts introduced by the masked rct itselfcan an unbiased method produce biasamong the experiments examined are those that augment the methodological stringency of a normal rct in order to render the experiment less susceptible to subversion by the mindthis methodology a hypothetical platinum standard can be used to judge the gold standardthe concealment in a placebocontrolled rct seems capable of generating a masking biasother potential biases such as investigator selfselection preference and consent are also briefly discussedsuch potential distortions indicate that the doubleblind rct may not be objective in the realist sense but rather is objective in a softer disciplinary sensesome facts may not exist independent of the apparatus of their production
