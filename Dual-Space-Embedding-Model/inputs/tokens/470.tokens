background shortterm studies established that calcium influences bone accretion during growthwhether longterm supplementation influences bone accretion in young adults is not knownobjective this study evaluated the longterm effects of calcium supplementation on bone accretion among females from childhood to young adulthooddesign a 4y randomized clinical trial recruited 354 females in pubertal stage 2 and optionally was extended for an additional 3 ythe mean dietary calcium intake of the participants over 7 y was approximately 830 mgd calciumsupplemented persons received an additional approximately 670 mgdprimary outcome variables were distal and proximal radius bone mineral density bmd totalbody bmd tbbmd and metacarpal cortical indexesresults multivariate analyses of the primary outcomes indicated that calciumsupplementation effects vary over timefollowup univariate analyses indicated that all primary outcomes were significantly larger in the supplemented group than in the placebo group at the year 4 endpointhowever at the year 7 endpoint this effect vanished for tbbmd and distal radius bmdlongitudinal models for tbbmd and proximal radius bmd according to the time since menarche showed a highly significant effect of supplementation during the pubertal growth spurt and a diminishing effect thereafterpost hoc stratifications by complianceadjusted total calcium intake and by final stature or metacarpal total crosssectional area showed that calcium effects depend on compliance and body frameconclusions calcium supplementation significantly influenced bone accretion in young females during the pubertal growth spurtby young adulthood significant effects remained at metacarpals and at the forearm of tall persons which indicated that the calcium requirement for growth is associated with skeletal sizethese results may be important for both primary prevention of osteoporosis and prevention of bone fragility fractures during growth
