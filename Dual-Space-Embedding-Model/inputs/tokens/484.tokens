context antidepressant medications represent the best established treatment for major depressive disorder mdd but there is little evidence that they have a specific pharmacological effect relative to pillplacebo for patients with less severe depressionobjective to estimate the relative benefit of medication vs placebo across a wide range of initial symptom severity in patients diagnosed with depressiondata sources pubmed psycinfo and the cochrane library databases were searched from january 1980 through march 2009 along with references from metaanalyses and reviewsstudy selection randomized placebocontrolled trials of fda approved antidepressants in the treatment of major or minor depressive disorder were selectedstudies were included if their authors provided the requisite original data they comprised adult outpatients included a medication vs placebo comparison for at least 6 weeks did not exclude patients on the basis of a placebo washout period and utilized the hamilton rating scale for depressiondata from six studies 718 patients were includeddata extraction individual patientlevel data were obtained from study authorsresults medication vs placebo differences varied substantially as a function of baseline severityamong patients with hamilton scores below 23 cohens dtype effect sizes for the difference between medication and placebo were estimated to be  20 a standard definition of a small effectestimates of the magnitude of the superiority of medication over placebo increased with increases in baseline hamilton severity and crossed the nice threshold for a clinically significant difference at a baseline score of 25conclusions the magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent on average in patients with mild or moderate symptomsfor patients with very severe depression the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial
