epidemiological evidence suggests that the mediterranean diet md could reduce the risk of breast cancer bcas evidence from the prospective studies remains scarce and conflicting we investigated the association between adherence to the md and risk of bc among 335062 women recruited from 1992 to 2000 in ten european countries and followed for 11 years on averageadherence to the md was estimated through an adapted relative mediterranean diet armed score excluding alcoholcox proportional hazards regression models were used while adjusting for bc risk factorsa total of 9009 postmenopausal and 1216 premenopausal first primary incident invasive bc were identified 5862 estrogen or progesterone receptor positive erpr and 1018 estrogen and progesterone receptor negative erprthe armed was inversely associated with the risk of bc overall and in postmenopausal women high vs low armed score hazard ratio hr  094 95 confidence interval ci 088 100 ptrend  0048 and hr  093 95 ci 087 099 ptrend  0037 respectivelythe association was more pronounced in erpr tumors hr  080 95 ci 065 099 ptrend  0043the armed score was not associated with bc in premenopausal womenour findings show that adherence to a md excluding alcohol was related to a modest reduced risk of bc in postmenopausal women and this association was stronger in receptornegative tumorsthe results support the potential scope for bc prevention through dietary modificationcopyright  2012 uicc
