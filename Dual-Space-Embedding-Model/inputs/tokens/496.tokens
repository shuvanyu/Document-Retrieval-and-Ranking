the endothelium is involved in many of the processes related to the development of atherosclerosis which is considered an inflammatory diseaseactually traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis predispose to endothelial dysfunction which is manifested as an increase in the expression of specific cytokines and adhesion moleculesthere are firm evidence supporting the beneficial effects of olive oil the most genuine component of the mediterranean dietalthough the effects of olive oil and other oleic acidrich dietary oils on atherosclerosis and plasma lipids are well known the roles of minor components have been less investigatedminor components constitute only 12 of virgin olive oil voo and are composed of hydrocarbons polyphenols tocopherols sterols triterpenoids and other components usually found in tracesdespite their low concentration nonfatty acid constituents may be of importance because studies comparing monounsaturated dietary oils have reported different effects on cardiovascular diseasemost of these compounds have demonstrated antioxidant antiinflammatory and hypolipidemic propertiesin this review we summarize current knowledge on the effects of these compounds contained in voo on vascular dysfunction and the mechanisms by which they modulate endothelial activitysuch mechanisms involve the release of nitric oxide eicosanoids prostaglandins and leukotrienes and adhesion molecules in most cases by activation of nuclear factor kappab by reactive oxygen species
