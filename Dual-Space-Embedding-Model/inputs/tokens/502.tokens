objective to investigate the relative importance of the individual components of the mediterranean diet in generating the inverse association of increased adherence to this diet and overall mortalitydesign prospective cohort studysetting greek segment of the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epicparticipants 23 349 men and women not previously diagnosed with cancer coronary heart disease or diabetes with documented survival status until june 2008 and complete information on nutritional variables and important covariates at enrolmentmain outcome measure all cause mortalityresults after a mean followup of 85 years 652 deaths from any cause had occurred among 12 694 participants with mediterranean diet scores 04 and 423 among 10 655 participants with scores of 5 or morecontrolling for potential confounders higher adherence to a mediterranean diet was associated with a statistically significant reduction in total mortality adjusted mortality ratio per two unit increase in score 0864 95 confidence interval 0802 to 0932the contributions of the individual components of the mediterranean diet to this association were moderate ethanol consumption 235 low consumption of meat and meat products 166 high vegetable consumption 162 high fruit and nut consumption 112 high monounsaturated to saturated lipid ratio 106 and high legume consumption 97the contributions of high cereal consumption and low dairy consumption were minimal whereas high fish and seafood consumption was associated with a nonsignificant increase in mortality ratioconclusion the dominant components of the mediterranean diet score as a predictor of lower mortality are moderate consumption of ethanol low consumption of meat and meat products and high consumption of vegetables fruits and nuts olive oil and legumesminimal contributions were found for cereals and dairy products possibly because they are heterogeneous categories of foods with differential health effects and for fish and seafood the intake of which is low in this population
