background and aims although dietary fats and cholesterol have previously been associated with risk of cardiovascular disease cvd in middle aged populations less is known among older adultsthe purpose of this study was to determine the association between dietary fats cholesterol and eggs and cvd risk among communitydwelling adults aged 7079 in the health aging and body composition studymethods and results diet was assessed using an intervieweradministered 108item food frequency questionnaire n1941cvd events were defined as a confirmed myocardial infarction coronary death or strokerelative rates of cvd over 9 years of followup were estimated using cox proportional hazards modelsduring followup there were 203 incident cases of cvdthere were no significant associations between dietary fats and cvd riskdietary cholesterol hr 95 ci 147 093 232 for the upper vs lower tertile p for trend 010 and egg consumption hr 95 ci 168 112 251 for 3week vs 1week p for trend 001 were associated with increased cvd riskhowever in subgroup analyses dietary cholesterol and egg consumption were associated with increased cvd risk only among older adults with type 2 diabetes hr 95 ci 366 109 1229 and 502 163 1552 respectively for the upper vs lower tertilegroupconclusions dietary cholesterol and egg consumption were associated with increased cvd risk among older communitydwelling adults with type 2 diabetesfurther research on the biological mechanisms for the increased cvd risk with higher dietary cholesterol and frequent egg consumption among older adults with diabetes is warranted
