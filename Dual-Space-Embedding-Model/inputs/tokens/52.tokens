there is evidence that certain phytoestrogens inhibit aromatase the enzyme that converts androgens to oestrogenskinetic studies in cellfree preparations show that they may inhibit aromatase by competitive binding to the enzyme but there is a paucity of studies investigating longerterm effects of phytoestrogens on the expression of steroidogenic enzymesthis study tested the hypothesis that phytoestrogens could reduce aromatase activity by downregulation of its expressionexperiments were carried out on primary cultures of human granulosaluteal gl cells after they had been exposed to phytoestrogens for 48 h aromatase activity was measured by the ability of cells to convert testosterone to estradiol over a 4h period and aromatase mrna expression mrnaarom was subsequently measured from the same cells using quantitative realtime pcrthe compounds investigated were the flavones apigenin and quercetin and the isoflavones genistein biochanin a and daidzein at doses of 10 microm and 100 nmcombinations of these compounds at the lower dose were also investigatedall compounds tested dosedependently reduced mean mrnaarom compared with controlsapigenin was the most potent inhibitor with significant inhibition of mrnaarom seen at both 10 microm and 100 nm whilst other flavonoids except biochanin a only induced significant inhibition por005 at the higher doselow dose 100 nm mixtures of the compounds were ineffective except for a combination of the three isoflavones that induced a significant inhibition of mrnaaromthe changes in aromatase activity paralleled the mrnaarom results and additional studies showed that the reduction in aromatase activity was significantly delayed in time compared with the reduction in mrnaaromthis is the first study to compare the action of various phytoestrogens either singly or in lowdose combination on the expression and activity of aromatase in human cells and it suggests that chronic dietary exposure and tissue accumulation of lowdose mixtures of phytoestrogens could have important consequences for aromatase activity and the production of oestrogens
