objective this metaanalysis aims to quantitatively synthesize all studies that examine the association between adherence to a mediterranean diet and risk of stroke depression cognitive impairment and parkinson diseasemethods potentially eligible publications were those providing effect estimates of relative risk rr for the association between mediterranean diet and the aforementioned outcomesstudies were sought in pubmed up to october 31 2012maximally adjusted effect estimates were extracted separate analyses were performed for high and moderate adherenceresults twentytwo eligible studies were included 11 covered stroke 9 covered depression and 8 covered cognitive impairment only 1 pertained to parkinsons diseasehigh adherence to mediterranean diet was consistently associated with reduced risk for stroke rr  071 95 confidence interval ci  057089 depression rr  068 95 ci  054086 and cognitive impairment rr  060 95 ci  043083moderate adherence was similarly associated with reduced risk for depression and cognitive impairment whereas the protective trend concerning stroke was only marginalsubgroup analyses highlighted the protective actions of high adherence in terms of reduced risk for ischemic stroke mild cognitive impairment dementia and particularly alzheimer diseasemetaregression analysis indicated that the protective effects of mediterranean diet in stroke prevention seemed more sizeable among malesconcerning depression the protective effects of high adherence seemed independent of age whereas the favorable actions of moderate adherence seemed to fade away with more advanced ageinterpretation adherence to a mediterranean diet may contribute to the prevention of a series of brain diseases this may be of special value given the aging of western societies 2013 american neurological association
