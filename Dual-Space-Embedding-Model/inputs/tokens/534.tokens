hydrogen sulfide h2s is produced by indigenous sulfatereducing bacteria in the large intestine and represents an environmental insult to the colonic epitheliumclinical studies have linked the presence of either sulfatereducing bacteria or h2s in the colon with chronic disorders such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer although at this point the evidence is circumstantial and underlying mechanisms remain undefinedwe showed previously that sulfide at concentrations similar to those found in the human colon induced genomic dna damage in mammalian cellsthe present study addressed the nature of the dna damage by determining if sulfide is directly genotoxic or if genotoxicity requires cellular metabolismwe also questioned if sulfide genotoxicity is mediated by free radicals and if dna base oxidation is involvednaked nuclei from untreated chinese hamster ovary cells were treated with sulfide dna damage was induced by concentrations as low as 1 micromollthis damage was effectively quenched by cotreatment with butylhydroxyanisolefurthermore sulfide treatment increased the number of oxidized bases recognized by formamidopyrimidine fapydna glycosylasethese results confirm the genotoxicity of sulfide and strongly implicate that this genotoxicity is mediated by free radicalsthese observations highlight the possible role of sulfide as an environmental insult that given a predisposing genetic background may lead to genomic instability or the cumulative mutations characteristic of colorectal cancer
