background hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitissulfide generation in the colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfurcontaining amino acids saas and inorganic sulfur eg sulfiteobjective we assessed the contribution of saas from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding studydesign five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5 diets for 10 d eachmeat intake ranged from 0 gd with a vegetarian diet to 600 gd with a highmeat dietfecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet periodadditionally 5 or 10 g bovine serum albumin or caseinl was added to batch cultures inoculated with feces from 4 healthy volunteersconcentrations of sulfide ammonia and lowryreactive substances were measured over 48 h results mean sem fecal sulfide concentrations ranged from 022  002 mmolkg with the 0gd diet to 338  031 mmolkg with the 600gd diet and were significantly related to meat intake p  0001sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion as measured by the disappearance of lowryreactive substances and the appearance of ammoniaconclusion dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine
