we examined the correlation between the incidence of crohn disease and dietary change in a relatively homogeneous japanese populationthe incidence and daily intake of each dietary component were compared annually from 1966 to 1985the univariate analysis showed that the increased incidence of crohn disease was strongly p  0001 correlated with increased dietary intake of total fat r  0919animal fat r  0880 n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids r  0883 animal protein r  0908 milk protein r  0924 and the ratio of n6 to n3 fatty acid intake r  0792it was less correlated with intake of total protein r  0482 p  005 was not correlated with intake of fish protein r  0055 p  01 and was inversely correlated with intake of vegetable protein r  0941 p  0001the multivariate analysis showed that increased intake of animal protein was the strongest independent factor with a weaker second factor an increased ration of n6 to n3 polyunsaturated fatty acidsthe present study in association with reported clinical studies suggests that increased dietary intake of animal protein and n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with less n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to the development of crohn disease
