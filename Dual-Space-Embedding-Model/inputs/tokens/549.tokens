longevity lifespan cancer cellular transformation energy calorie restriction diabeteswhat can tie together such a diversity of hot topics in biomedical researchemerging findings suggest that the answer lies in understanding the functions of the recently discovered family of proteins known as sirtuinsbarcelona hosted the first scientific meeting completely focused on these evolutionary conserved protein deacetylases bringing together experts in the biochemistry to cellular biology mice models drug targeting and pathophysiology of these moleculestheir work summarized here establishes the sirtuins as major players in cellular homeostasis and human diseases that act through a whole range of biochemical substrates and physiological processesundoubtedly this is an increasingly expanding field that it is here to stay and growth
