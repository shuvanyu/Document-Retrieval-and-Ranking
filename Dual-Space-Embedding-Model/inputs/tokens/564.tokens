aimshypothesis the amount and quality of fat in the diet could be of importance for development of insulin resistance and related metabolic disordersour aim was to determine whether a change in dietary fat quality alone could alter insulin action in humansmethods the kanwu study included 162 healthy subjects chosen at random to receive a controlled isoenergetic diet for 3 months containing either a high proportion of saturated safa diet or monounsaturated mufa diet fatty acidswithin each group there was a second assignment at random to supplements with fish oil 36 g n3 fatty acidsd or placeboresults insulin sensitivity was significantly impaired on the saturated fatty acid diet 10 p  003 but did not change on the monounsaturated fatty acid diet 2 ns p  005 for difference between dietsinsulin secretion was not affectedthe addition of n3 fatty acids influenced neither insulin sensitivity nor insulin secretionthe favourable effects of substituting a monounsaturated fatty acid diet for a saturated fatty acid diet on insulin sensitivity were only seen at a total fat intake below median 37ehere insulin sensitivity was 125 lower and 88 higher on the saturated fatty acid diet and monounsaturated fatty acid diet respectively p  003low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl increased on the saturated fatty acid diet 41 p  001 but decreased on the monounsaturated fatty acid diet mufa 52 p  0001 whereas lipoprotein a lpa increased on a monounsaturated fatty acid diet by 12 p  0001conclusionsinterpretation a change of the proportions of dietary fatty acids decreasing saturated fatty acid and increasing monounsaturated fatty acid improves insulin sensitivity but has no effect on insulin secretiona beneficial impact of the fat quality on insulin sensitivity is not seen in individuals with a high fat intake  37e
