the ingestion of excessive amounts of saturated fatty acids sfas and transfatty acids tfas is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases insulin resistance dyslipidemia and obesitythe focus of this paper was to elucidate the influence of dietary sfa and tfa intake on the promotion of lipotoxicity to the liver and cardiovascular endothelial and gut microbiota systems as well as on insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum stressthe saturated and transfatty acids favor a proinflammatory state leading to insulin resistancethese fatty acids can be involved in several inflammatory pathways contributing to disease progression in chronic inflammation autoimmunity allergy cancer atherosclerosis hypertension and heart hypertrophy as well as other metabolic and degenerative diseasesas a consequence lipotoxicity may occur in several target organs by direct effects represented by inflammation pathways and through indirect effects including an important alteration in the gut microbiota associated with endotoxemiainteractions between these pathways may perpetuate a feedback process that exacerbates an inflammatory statethe importance of lifestyle modification including an improved diet is recommended as a strategy for treatment of these diseases
