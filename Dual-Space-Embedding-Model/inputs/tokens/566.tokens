objective to test the hypothesis that dietary factors in the vegan diet lead to improved insulin sensitivity and lower intramyocellular lipid imcl storagedesign casecontrol studysetting imperial college school of medicine hammersmith hospital campus london uksubjects a total of 24 vegans and 25 omnivores participated in this study three vegan subjects could not be matched therefore the matched results are shown for 21 vegans and 25 omnivoresthe subjects were matched for gender age and body mass index bmiinterventions full anthropometry 7day dietary assessment and physical activity levels were obtainedinsulin sensitivity s and betacell function b were determined using the homeostatic model assessment homaimcl levels were determined using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy total body fat content was assessed by bioelectrical impedanceresults there was no difference between the groups in sex age bmi waist measurement percentage body fat activity levels and energy intakevegans had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure 110 mmhg ci 206 to 13 p0027 and higher dietary intake of carbohydrate 107 ci 68145 p0001 nonstarch polysaccharides 207 g ci 158256 p0001 and polyunsaturated fat 28 ci 1046 p0003 with a significantly lower glycaemic index 37 ci 67 to 07 p001also vegans had lower fasting plasma triacylglycerol 07 mmoll ci 09 to 04 p0001 and glucose 04 mmoll ci 07 to 009 p005 concentrationsthere was no significant difference in homa s but there was with homa b 321 ci 103539 p0005 while imcl levels were significantly lower in the soleus muscle 97 ci 162 to 33 p001conclusion vegans have a food intake and a biochemical profile that will be expected to be cardioprotective with lower imcl accumulation and betacell protective
