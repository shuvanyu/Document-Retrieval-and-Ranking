backgroundobjectives vegans have a lower incidence of insulin resistance irassociated diseases and a higher insulin sensitivity is compared with omnivoresthe aim of this study was to examine whether the higher is in vegans relates to markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and to intramyocellular lipid imcl contentsubjectsmethods eleven vegans and 10 matched race age sex body mass index physical activity and energy intake omnivorous controls were enrolled in a casecontrol studyanthropometry bioimpedance bia ultrasound measurement of visceral and subcutaneous fat layer parameters of glucose and lipid homeostasis hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and muscle biopsies were performedcitrate synthase cs activity mitochondrial dna mtdna and imcl content were assessed in skeletal muscle samplesresults both groups were comparable in anthropometric and bia parameters physical activity and proteinenergy intakevegans had significantly higher glucose disposal mvalue vegans 811151 vs controls 631157 mgkgmin 95 confidence interval 0402 to 3212 p0014 slightly lower imcl content vegans 1391 78 to 440 vs controls 1736 124 to 785 mgg of muscle 95 confidence interval 7594 to 24550 p0193 and slightly higher relative muscle mtdna amount vegans 136031 vs controls 113036 95 confidence interval0078 to 0537 p0135no significant differences were found in cs activity vegans 1843505 vs controls 1816541 μmolgmin 95 confidence interval 4503 to 5050 p0906conclusions vegans have a higher is but comparable mitochondrial density and imcl content with omnivoresthis suggests that a decrease in wholebody glucose disposal may precede muscle lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in ir development
