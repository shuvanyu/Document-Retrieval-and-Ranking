human adiposity has long been associated with insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk and abdominal adiposity is considered particularly adverseintraabdominal fat is associated with insulin resistance possibly mediated by greater lipolytic activity lower adiponectin levels resistance to leptin and increased inflammatory cytokines although the latter contribution is less clearliver lipid is also closely associated with and likely to be an important contributor to insulin resistance but it may also be in part the consequence of the lipogenic pathway of insulin action being upregulated by hyperinsulinemia and unimpaired signalingagain intramyocellular triglyceride is associated with muscle insulin resistance but anomalies include higher intramyocellular triglyceride in insulinsensitive athletes and women vs mensuch issues could be explained if the culprits were active lipid moieties such as diacylglycerol and ceramide species dependent more on lipid metabolism and partitioning than triglyceride amountsubcutaneous fat especially gluteofemoral appears metabolically protective illustrated by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in patients with lipodystrophyhowever some studies suggest that deep sc abdominal fat may have adverse propertiespericardial and perivascular fat relate to atheromatous disease but not clearly to insulin resistancethere has been recent interest in recognizable brown adipose tissue in adult humans and its possible augmentation by a hormone irisin from exercising musclebrown adipose tissue is metabolically active oxidizes fatty acids and generates heat but because of its small and variable quantities its metabolic importance in humans under usual living conditions is still unclearfurther understanding of specific roles of different lipid depots may help new approaches to control obesity and its metabolic sequelae
