obesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetesowing to the increase in obesity life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent historythe factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells adipocytes is thought to be most importanthere we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adultshowever the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals even after marked weight loss indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescenceto establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of 14c derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic dnaapproximately 10 of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass indexneither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthoodthe high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity
