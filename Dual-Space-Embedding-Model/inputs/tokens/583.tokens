objective to explain the predisposition for insulin resistance among african american aa adolescents this study aimed to 1 examine changes in intramyocellular lipid content imcl and insulin sensitivity with intralipid il infusion and 2 determine whether the increase in imcl is comparable between aa and caucasian adolescentsmaterials and methods thirteen aa and 15 caucasian normalweight adolescents bmi 85th underwent a 3h hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp on two occasions in random order after an overnight 12hr infusion of 1 20 il and 2 normal saline nsimcl was quantified by 1hmagnetic resonance spectroscopy in tibialis anterior muscle before and after il infusionresults during il infusion plasma tg glycerol ffa and fat oxidation increased significantly with no race differenceshepatic insulin sensitivity decreased with il infusion with no difference between the groupsil infusion was associated with a significant increase in imcl which was comparable between aa δ 105 ns 19  08 vs il 39  16 mmolkg wet weight and caucasian δ 86 ns 28  21 vs il 52  24 mmolkg wet weight with similar reductions p001 in insulin sensitivity between the groups δ 44 ns 91  33 vs il 51  18 mgkgmin per µuml in aa and δ39 ns 129  60 vs il 79  38 mgkgmin per µuml in caucasian adolescentsconclusions in healthy adolescents an acute elevation in plasma ffa with il infusion is accompanied by significant increases in imcl and reductions in insulin sensitivity with no race differentialour findings suggest that aa normalweight adolescents are not more susceptible than caucasians to ffainduced imcl accumulation and insulin resistance
