a quarter century has passed since the first publication of the evolutionary discordance hypothesis according to which departures from the nutrition and activity patterns of our huntergatherer ancestors have contributed greatly and in specifically definable ways to the endemic chronic diseases of modern civilizationrefinements of the model have changed it in some respects but anthropological evidence continues to indicate that ancestral human diets prevalent during our evolution were characterized by much lower levels of refined carbohydrates and sodium much higher levels of fiber and protein and comparable levels of fat primarily unsaturated fat and cholesterolphysical activity levels were also much higher than current levels resulting in higher energy throughputwe said at the outset that such evidence could only suggest testable hypotheses and that recommendations must ultimately rest on more conventional epidemiological clinical and laboratory studiessuch studies have multiplied and have supported many aspects of our model to the extent that in some respects official recommendations today have targets closer to those prevalent among huntergatherers than did comparable recommendations 25 years agofurthermore doubts have been raised about the necessity for very low levels of protein fat and cholesterol intake common in official recommendationsmost impressively randomized controlled trials have begun to confirm the value of huntergatherer diets in some highrisk groups even as compared with routinely recommended dietsmuch more research needs to be done but the past quarter century has proven the interest and heuristic value if not yet the ultimate validity of the model
