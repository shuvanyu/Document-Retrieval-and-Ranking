there is much interest in the potential of dietary antioxidants to attenuate in vivo oxidative stress but little characterization of the time course of plasma effects existsculinary spices have demonstrated potent in vitro antioxidant propertiesthe objective of this study was to examine whether adding 14 g of a high antioxidant spice blend to a 5060kj 1200 kcal meal exerted significant postprandial effects on markers of plasma antioxidant status and metabolismhealthy overweight men n  6 consumed a control and spiced meal in a randomized crossover design with 1 wk between testing sessionsblood was sampled prior to the meal and at 30min intervals for 35 h total of 8 samplesmixed linear models demonstrated a treatment  time interaction p  005 for insulin and tg corresponding with 21 and 31 reductions in postprandial levels with the spiced meal respectivelyadding spices to the meal significantly increased the ferric reducing antioxidant power such that postprandial increases following the spiced meal were 2fold greater than after the control meal p  0009the hydrophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac of plasma also was increased by spices p  002there were no treatment differences in glucose total thiols lipophilic orac or total oracthe incorporation of spices into the diet may help normalize postprandial insulin and tg and enhance antioxidant defenses
