objective the objective of this study was to assess expectations of effect when using statins in a treatment populationfurther the aim was to examine factors including history and concurrent risk of coronary heart disease associated with a higher and lower treatment beliefmethods eight hundred and twentynine 829 swedish patients using statins completed postal questionnaires about their health life style cardiovascular risk factors and expectation of the treatmentexpected treatment benefit was used as outcome measurementresults a medical history of coronary heart disease did not affect treatment expectationspatients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease reported a slightly lower expectation of the treatment effect at a 10year perspective p001 but not at shorter time perspectiveslow satisfaction with the explanation of the purpose of the treatment and a poor perceived control of own health was associated with a more negative view on treatment benefitconclusion the rationale applied by physicians prescribing statins does not seem to relate to the patients expectations whereas factors relating to the patientphysician relationship the social situation and the perceived control of health seem to affect patient beliefpractice implications the association between patients poor satisfaction of treatment explanation and a low belief in treatment benefits emphasizes the importance of the patientphysician communicationit is suggested that clinical tools are developed in order to identify patients with poor belief in treatment benefit since tailored education for this group might reduce the risk of noncompliance and subsequently reduce the risk of coronary heart disease
