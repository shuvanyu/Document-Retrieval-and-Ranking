objectives the study aimed to find the threshold of benefit for a hypothetical cholesterollowering drug below which the subject would not be prepared to take the drugwe also looked at whether proximity to the target event myocardial infarction and the subjects views on drug taking affected this thresholddesign we studied 307 subjects using a written questionnaire and interviewgroup 1 102 subjects had just been discharged from the coronary care unitgroup 2 105 subjects were taking cardioprotective drugs but had no recent history of myocardial infarctiongroup 3 100 subjects had no history of myocardial infarction and were taking no cardioprotective drugsresults median values for the threshold of benefit below which the subject would not take the preventive drug were 20 20 and 30 absolute risk reduction for groups 1 2 and 3 respectivelymedian values for expectation of average prolongation of life were 12 12 and 18 months respectivelyonly 27 of subjects would take a drug offering 5 or less absolute risk reduction over five yearssubjects views on medicinal drug taking in general and proximity to the target event were predictors of the acceptance of preventive drugseighty percent of subjects wished to be told the numerical benefit of a preventive drug before starting on itconclusion for the majority the expectation of benefit from a preventive drug is higher than the actual benefit provided by current drug strategiesthere is a tension between the patients right to know about the chance of benefiting from a preventive drug and the likely reduction in uptake if they are so informed
