animal work over the last three decades has generated a convincing body of evidence that a western diet  one high in saturated fat and refined carbohydrates hfs diet  can damage various brain systemsin this review we examine whether there is evidence for this in humans using converging lines of evidence from neuropsychological epidemiological and neuroimaging datausing the animal research as the organizing principal we examined evidence for dietary induced impairments in frontal limbic and hippocampal systems and with their associated functions in learning memory cognition and hedonicsevidence for the role of hfs diet in attention deficit disorder and in neurodegenerative conditions was also examinedwhile human research data is still at an early stage there is evidence of an association between hfs diet and impaired cognitive functionbased upon the animal data and a growing understanding of how hfs diets can disrupt brain function we further suggest that there is a causal link running from hfs diet to impaired brain function in humans and that hfs diets also contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditionscrown copyright  2013published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
