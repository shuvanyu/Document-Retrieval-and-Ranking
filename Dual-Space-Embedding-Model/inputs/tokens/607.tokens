epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary lutein and zeaxanthin may be of benefit in maintaining cognitive healthamong the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin are the only two that cross the bloodretina barrier to form macular pigment mp in the eyethey also preferentially accumulate in the human brainlutein and zeaxanthin in macula from nonhuman primates were found to be significantly correlated with their concentrations in matched brain tissuetherefore mp can be used as a biomarker of lutein and zeaxanthin in primate brain tissuethis is of interest given that a significant correlation was found between mp density and global cognitive function in healthy older adultsan examination of a relation between cognition and lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations in the brain tissue of decedents from a populationbased study in centenarians found that zeaxanthin concentrations in brain tissue were significantly related to antemortem measures of global cognitive function memory retention verbal fluency and dementia severity after adjustment for age sex education hypertension and diabetesin univariate analyses lutein was related to recall and verbal fluency but the strength of the associations was attenuated with adjustment for covariateshowever lutein concentrations in the brain were significantly lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment than in those with normal cognitive functionlast in a 4mo doubleblinded placebocontrolled trial in older women that involved lutein supplementation 12 mgd alone or in combination with dha 800 mgd verbal fluency scores improved significantly in the dha lutein and combinedtreatment groupsmemory scores and rate of learning improved significantly in the combinedtreatment group who also showed a trend toward more efficient learningwhen all of these observations are taken into consideration the idea that lutein and zeaxanthin can influence cognitive function in older adults warrants further study
