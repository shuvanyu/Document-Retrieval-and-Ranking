vascular endothelial function is declines with aging and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseaselifestyle modification particularly aerobic exercise and dietary adjustment has a favorable effect on vascular agingcurcumin is a major component of turmeric with known antiinflammatory and antioxidative effectswe investigated the effects of curcumin ingestion and aerobic exercise training on flowmediated dilation as an indicator endothelial function in postmenopausal womena total of 32 postmenopausal women were assigned to 3 groups control exercise and curcumin groupsthe curcumin group ingested curcumin orally for 8 weeksthe exercise group underwent moderate aerobic exercise training for 8 weeksbefore and after each intervention flowmediated dilation was measuredno difference in baseline flowmediated dilation or other key dependent variables were detected among the groupsflowmediated dilation increased significantly and equally in the curcumin and exercise groups whereas no changes were observed in the control groupour results indicated that curcumin ingestion and aerobic exercise training can increase flowmediated dilation in postmenopausal women suggesting that both can potentially improve the agerelated decline in endothelial functioncopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
