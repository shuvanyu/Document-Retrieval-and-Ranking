objective total sedentary absence of wholebody movement time is associated with obesity abnormal glucose metabolism and the metabolic syndromein addition to the effects of total sedentary time the manner in which it is accumulated may also be importantwe examined the association of breaks in objectively measured sedentary time with biological markers of metabolic riskresearch design and methods participants n  168 mean age 534 years for this crosssectional study were recruited from the 20042005 australian diabetes obesity and lifestyle studysedentary time was measured by an accelerometer countsminute1  100 worn during waking hours for seven consecutive dayseach interruption in sedentary time countsmin  or  100 was considered a breakfasting plasma glucose 2h plasma glucose serum triglycerides hdl cholesterol weight height waist circumference and resting blood pressure were measuredmatlab was used to derive the breaks variable spss was used for the statistical analysisresults independent of total sedentary time and moderatetovigorous intensity activity time increased breaks in sedentary time were beneficially associated with waist circumference standardized beta  016 95 ci 031 to 002 p  0026 bmi beta  019 035 to 002 p  0026 triglycerides beta  018 034 to 002 p  0029 and 2h plasma glucose beta  018 034 to 002 p  0025conclusions this study provides evidence of the importance of avoiding prolonged uninterrupted periods of sedentary primarily sitting timethese findings suggest new public health recommendations regarding breaking up sedentary time that are complementary to those for physical activity
