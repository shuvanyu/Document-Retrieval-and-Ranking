background sedentary behavior is a risk factor for cardiometabolic diseaseregularly interrupting sedentary behavior with activity breaks may lower this riskobjective we compared the effects of prolonged sitting continuous physical activity combined with prolonged sitting and regular activity breaks on postprandial metabolismdesign seventy adults participated in a randomized crossover studythe prolonged sitting intervention involved sitting for 9 h the physical activity intervention involved walking for 30 min and then sitting and the regularactivitybreak intervention involved walking for 1 min 40 s every 30 minparticipants consumed a mealreplacement beverage at 60 240 and 420 minresults the plasma incremental area under the curve iauc for insulin differed between interventions overall p  0001regular activity breaks lowered values by 8667 iu  l1  9 h1 95 ci 5060 12275 iu  l1  9 h1 p  0001 when compared with prolonged sitting and by 5420 iu  l1  9 h1 95 ci 1799 9042 iu  l1  9 h1 p  0003 when compared with physical activityplasma glucose iauc also differed between interventions overall p  0001regular activity breaks lowered values by 189 mmol  l1  9 h1 95 ci 100 280 mmol  l1  9 h1 p  0001 when compared with prolonged sitting and by 174 mmol  l1  9 h1 95 ci 84 263 mmol  l1  9 h1 p  0001 when compared with physical activityplasma triglyceride iauc differed between interventions overall p  0023physical activity lowered values by 63 mmol  l1  9 h1 95 ci 18 107 mmol  l1  9 h1 p  0006 when compared with regular activity breaksconclusion regular activity breaks were more effective than continuous physical activity at decreasing postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in healthy normalweight adultsthis trial was registered with the australian new zealand clinical trials registry as actrn12610000953033
