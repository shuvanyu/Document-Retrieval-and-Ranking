objectives to justify the effects of mentha piperita labiatae and mentha spicata labiatae herbal teas on plasma total testosterone luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormone levels and testicular histologic featureswe performed this study because of major complaints in our area from men about the adverse effects of these herbs on male reproductive functionmethods the experimental study included 48 male wistar albino rats body weight 200 to 250 gthe rats were randomized into four groups of 12 rats eachthe control group was given commercial drinking water and the experimental groups were given 20 gl m piperita tea 20 gl m spicata tea or 40 gl m spicata tearesults the folliclestimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels had increased and total testosterone levels had decreased in the experimental groups compared with the control group the differences were statistically significantalso the johnsen testicular biopsy scores were significantly different statistically between the experimental groups and the control groupalthough the mean seminiferous tubular diameter of the experimental groups was relatively greater than in the control group the difference was not statistically significantthe only effects of m piperita on testicular tissue was segmental maturation arrest in the seminiferous tubules however the effects of m spicata extended from maturation arrest to diffuse germ cell aplasia in relation to the doseconclusions despite the beneficial effects of m piperita and m spicata in digestion we should also be aware of the toxic effects when the herbs are not used in the recommended fashion or at the recommended dose
