importance some evidence suggests vegetarian dietary patterns may be associated with reduced mortality but the relationship is not well establishedobjective to evaluate the association between vegetarian dietary patterns and mortalitydesign prospective cohort study mortality analysis by cox proportional hazards regression controlling for important demographic and lifestyle confounderssetting adventist health study 2 ahs2 a large north american cohortparticipants a total of 96 469 seventhday adventist men and women recruited between 2002 and 2007 from which an analytic sample of 73 308 participants remained after exclusionsexposures diet was assessed at baseline by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized into 5 dietary patterns nonvegetarian semivegetarian pescovegetarian lactoovovegetarian and veganmain outcome and measure the relationship between vegetarian dietary patterns and allcause and causespecific mortality deaths through 2009 were identified from the national death indexresults there were 2570 deaths among 73 308 participants during a mean followup time of 579 yearsthe mortality rate was 605 95 ci 582629 deaths per 1000 personyearsthe adjusted hazard ratio hr for allcause mortality in all vegetarians combined vs nonvegetarians was 088 95 ci 080097the adjusted hr for allcause mortality in vegans was 085 95 ci 073101 in lactoovovegetarians 091 95 ci 082100 in pescovegetarians 081 95 ci 069094 and in semivegetarians 092 95 ci 075113 compared with nonvegetarianssignificant associations with vegetarian diets were detected for cardiovascular mortality noncardiovascular noncancer mortality renal mortality and endocrine mortalityassociations in men were larger and more often significant than were those in womenconclusions and relevance vegetarian diets are associated with lower allcause mortality and with some reductions in causespecific mortalityresults appeared to be more robust in malesthese favorable associations should be considered carefully by those offering dietary guidance
