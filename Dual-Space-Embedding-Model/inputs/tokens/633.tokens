background few previous prospective studies have examined differences in incident ischemic heart disease ihd risk between vegetarians and nonvegetariansobjective the objective was to examine the association of a vegetarian diet with risk of incident nonfatal and fatal ihddesign a total of 44561 men and women living in england and scotland who were enrolled in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epicoxford study of whom 34 consumed a vegetarian diet at baseline were part of the analysisincident cases of ihd were identified through linkage with hospital records and death certificatesserum lipids and blood pressure measurements were available for 1519 non cases who were matched to ihd cases by sex and ageihd risk by vegetarian status was estimated by using multivariate cox proportional hazards modelsresults after an average followup of 116 y there were 1235 ihd cases 1066 hospital admissions and 169 deathscompared with nonvegetarians vegetarians had a lower mean bmi in kgm2 12 95 ci 13 11 nonhdlcholesterol concentration 045 95 ci 060 030 mmoll and systolic blood pressure 33 95 ci 59 07 mm hgvegetarians had a 32 lower risk hr 068 95 ci 058 081 of ihd than did nonvegetarians which was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for bmi and did not differ materially by sex age bmi smoking or the presence of ihd risk factorsconclusion consuming a vegetarian diet was associated with lower ihd risk a finding that is probably mediated by differences in nonhdl cholesterol and systolic blood pressure
