observational and ecological studies are generally used to determine the presence of effect of cancer riskmodifying factorsresearchers generally agree that environmental factors such as smoking alcohol consumption poor diet lack of physical activity and low serum 25hdyroxyvitamin d levels are important cancer risk factorsthis ecological study used ageadjusted incidence rates for 21 cancers for 157 countries 87 with highquality data in 2008 with respect to dietary supply and other factors including per capita gross domestic product life expectancy lung cancer incidence rate an index for smoking and latitude an index for solar ultravioletb dosesthe factors found to correlate strongly with multiple types of cancer were lung cancer direct correlation with 12 types of cancer energy derived from animal products direct correlation with 12 types of cancer inverse with two latitude direct correlation with six types inverse correlation with three and per capita gross national product five typeslife expectancy and sweeteners directly correlated with three cancers animal fat with two and alcohol with oneconsumption of animal products correlated with cancer incidence with a lag time of 1525 yearstypes of cancer which correlated strongly with animal product consumption tended to correlate weakly with latitude this occurred for 11 cancers for the entire set of countriesregression results were somewhat different for the 87 highquality country data set and the 157country setsinglecountry ecological studies have inversely correlated nearly all of these cancers with solar ultravioletb dosesthese results can provide guidance for prevention of cancer
