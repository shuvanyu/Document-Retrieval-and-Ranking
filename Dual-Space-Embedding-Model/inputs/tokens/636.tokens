although substantial nutrition transition characterized by an increased intake of energy animal fat and red meats has occurred during the last several decades in east asia few studies have systematically evaluated temporal trends in cancer incidence or mortality among populations in this areatherefore we sought to investigate this question with tremendous public health implicationsdata on mortality rates of cancers of the breast colon prostate esophagus and stomach for china 19882000 hong kong 19602006 japan 19502006 korea 19852006 and singapore 19632006 were obtained from whojoinpoint regression was used to investigate trends in mortality of these cancersa remarkable increase in mortality rates of breast colon and prostate cancers and a precipitous decrease in those of esophageal and stomach cancers have been observed in selected countries except breast cancer in hong kong during the study periodsfor example the annual percentage increase in breast cancer mortality was 55 95 confidence interval 38 73 for the period 19851993 in korea and mortality rates for prostate cancer significantly increased by 32 95 confidence interval 30 33 per year from 1958 to 1993 in japanthese changes in cancer mortality lagged  10 years behind the inception of the nutrition transition toward a westernized diet in selected countries or regionsthere have been striking changes in mortality rates of breast colon prostate esophageal and stomach cancers in east asia during the last several decades which may be at least in part attributable to the concurrent nutrition transition
