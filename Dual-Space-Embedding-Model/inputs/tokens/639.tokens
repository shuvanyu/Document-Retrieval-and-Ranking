objective to compare effects of raisin snacks with conventional snacks on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factorsmaterials and methods a 12week randomized controlled trial compared 3timesaday consumption of raisins with intake of processed snacks on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factorsmen and women were randomized to snacks n  15 or raisins n  31outcome measures were performed at baseline 4 8 and 12 weeksresults fasting plasma glucose levels were not significantly affected by intake of raisins or snacksmean subject post prandial glucose levels were significantly reduced by raisin intake at 12 weeks changes with raisin intake were 131 mgdl p  0003 vs baseline p  003 vs snackseating raisins significantly decreased glycated hemoglobin hba1c level 012 p  0004 a significantly greater level decrease than seen with snack intake p  0036snack intake did not significantly affect subject systolic or diastolic blood pressure bpraisin intake was associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure sbp at 4 8 and 12 weeks with mean changes of 60 to 102 mmhg all these changes were statistically significant p  0015 to 0001raisins were associated with significantly greater changes in diastolic blood pressure dbp at 4 8 and 12 weeks than snacks p  005body weight did not significantly change within or between groupsconclusions regular consumption of raisins may reduce glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors including bp rate
