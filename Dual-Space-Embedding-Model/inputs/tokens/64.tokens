aim the aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of metformin compared with a hypocaloric diet on creactive protein crp level and markers of insulin resistance in obese and overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcosmaterial and methods forty women with body mass index  27 and pcos were randomly allocated to receive either metformin or hypocaloric diet and were assessed before and after a treatment period of 12 weekshighsensitivity crp hscrp and markers of insulin resistance ir homeostasis model assessmentir quantitative insulinsensitivity check index and fasting glucose to insulin ratio were evaluated in each patientresults a total of 10 subjects did not complete the trial three patients in the metformin group and seven patients in the diet group and a total of 30 subjects completed the trial 17 subjects in the metformin group and 13 subjects in the diet groupserum concentration of hscrp significantly decreased in both the metformin 529  250 vs 381  199 p  0008 and diet groups 608  214 vs 427  160 p  0004there were no significant differences in mean hscrp decrement between the two groupsdecrease in hscrp levels was significantly correlated with waist circumference in the diet group r  08 p  0001the effect of a hypocaloric diet with 510 weight reduction on markers of insulin resistance homeostasis model assessmentir fasting glucose to insulin ratio quantitative insulinsensitivity check index was better than metformin therapy p  0001conclusions although weight reduction has equal efficacy with metformin in decreasing serum hscrp levels it was significantly more effective in improving insulin resistance in obese and overweight pcos women 2012 the authorsjournal of obstetrics and gynaecology research  2012 japan society of obstetrics and gynecology
