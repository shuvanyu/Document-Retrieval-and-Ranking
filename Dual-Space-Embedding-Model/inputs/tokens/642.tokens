we propose the hypothesis that a vegetarian diet reduces the risk of developing diabetesfindings that have generated this hypothesis are from a population of 25698 adult white seventhday adventists identified in 1960during 21 years of followup the risk of diabetes as an underlying cause of death in adventists was approximately onehalf the risk for all us whiteswithin the male adventist population vegetarians had a substantially lower risk than nonvegetarians of diabetes as an underlying or contributing cause of deathwithin both the male and female adventist populations the prevalence of selfreported diabetes also was lower in vegetarians than in nonvegetariansthe associations observed between diabetes and meat consumption were apparently not due to confounding by over or underweight other selected dietary factors or physical activityall of the associations between meat consumption and diabetes were stronger in males than in females
