background reduction or modification of dietary fat can improve total cholesterol levels but may also have a variety of effects both positive and negative on other cardiovascular risk factorsobjectives the aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of reduction or modification of dietary fats on total and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular morbidity over at least 6 months using all available randomized clinical trialssearch strategy the cochrane library medline embase cab s cvrct registry and related cochrane groups trial registers were searched through spring 1998 sigle to january 1999trials known to experts in the field and biographies were included through may 1999selection criteria trials fulfilled the following criteria 1 randomized with appropriate control group 2 intention to reduce or modify fat or cholesterol intake excluding exclusively omega3 fat interventions 3 not multi factorial 4 healthy adult humans 5 intervention at least six months 6 mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data availableinclusion decisions were duplicated disagreement resolved by discussion or a third partydata collection and analysis rate data were extracted by two independent reviewers and metaanalysis performed using random effects methodologymetaregression and funnel plots were usedmain results twenty seven studies were included 40 intervention arms 30901 personyearsthere was no significant effect on total mortality rate ratio 098 95 ci 086 to 112 a trend towards protection form cardiovascular mortality rate ratio 091 95 ci 077 to 107 and significant protection from cardiovascular events rate ratio 084 95 ci 072 to 099the latter became nonsignificant on sensitivity analysistrials where participants were involved for more than 2 years showed significant reductions in the rate of cardiovascular events and a suggestion of protection from total mortalitythe degree of protection from cardiovascular events appeared similar in high and low risk groups but was statistically significant only in the formerreviewers conclusions the findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk in trials longer than two yearslifestyle advice to all those at high risk of cardiovascular disease especially where statins are unavailable or rationed and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturates
