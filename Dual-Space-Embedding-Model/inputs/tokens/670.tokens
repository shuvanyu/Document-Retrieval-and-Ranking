crohns disease cd is associated with intestinal dysbiosis evidenced by an altered microbiome forming thick biofilms on the epitheliumadditionally adherentinvasive e coli aiec strains are frequently isolated from ileal lesions of cd patients indicating a potential role for these strains in disease pathogenesisthe composition and characteristics of the host microbiome are influenced by environmental factors particularly dietpolysaccharides added to food as emulsifiers stabilizers or bulking agents have been linked to bacteriaassociated intestinal disordersthe escalating consumption of polysaccharides in western diets parallels an increased incidence of cd during the latter 20th centuryin this study the effect of a polysaccharide panel on adhesiveness of the cdassociated aiec strain lf82 was analyzed to determine if these food additives promote diseaseassociated bacterial phenotypesmaltodextrin mdx a polysaccharide derived from starch hydrolysis markedly enhanced lf82 specific biofilm formationbiofilm formation of multiple other e coli strains was also promoted by mdxmdxinduced e coli biofilm formation was independent of polysaccharide chain length indicating a requirement for mdx metabolismmdx exposure induced type i pili expression which was required for mdxenhanced biofilm formationmdx also increased bacterial adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers in a mechanism dependent on type 1 pili and independent of the cellular receptor ceacam6 suggesting a novel mechanism of epithelial cell adhesionanalysis of mucosaassociated bacteria from individuals with and without cd showed increased prevalence of malx a gene essential for mdx metabolism uniquely in the ileum of cd patientsthese findings demonstrate that the ubiquitous dietary component mdx enhances e coli adhesion and suggests a mechanism by which western diets rich in specific polysaccharides may promote dysbiosis of gut microbes and contribute to disease susceptibility
