progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml is a rare demyelinating disorder of the brain caused by a ubiquitous polyomavirus jc viruspml is almost always associated with some underlying immunosuppression and acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been the most common predisposing disorderrecently different pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to increase the risk of pmltherapies that predispose people to pml can be classified into three categories therapies that uniquely increase the risk for the disorder such as the monoclonal antibodies natalizumab and efalizumab therapies that appear to increase the risk in individuals already at risk of pml due to preexisting conditions such as rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil and therapies with a mechanism of action that might suggest a potential for increased pml risk andor with which rare cases of pml have been observedunlike the latter two classes therapeutic agents uniquely increasing the risk of pml are associated with a much greater prevalence of the disorder and a latent interval from the time of drug initiation to the development of pmlpml development with pharmacological agents has provided new insight into the pathogenesis of this devastating disorderthis review focuses on the risks of pml with multiple pharmacological agents the proposed pathogenesis with these agents and potential risk mitigation strategies
