background crohns disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet is low in fibre and high in processed foodprimary lesions overlie peyers patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through mcells occurswe have assessed the effect of soluble nonstarch polysaccharide nsp and food emulsifiers on translocation of escherichia coli across mcellsmethods to assess effects of soluble plant fibres and food emulsifiers on translocation of mucosaassociated e coli isolates from crohns disease patients and from noncrohns controls we used mcell monolayers generated by coculture of caco2cl1 and raji b cells and human peyers patches mounted in ussing chambersresults e coli translocation increased across mcells compared to parent caco2cl1 monocultures 158fold iqr 62320 for crohns disease e coli n8 and 67fold iqr 37210 for control isolates n5electron microscopy confirmed e coli within mcellsplantain and broccoli nsp markedly reduced e coli translocation across mcells at 5 mgml range 453826 inhibition p001 apple and leek nsp had no significant effectpolysorbate80 001 volvol increased e coli translocation through caco2cl1 monolayers 59fold p005 and at higher concentrations increased translocation across mcellssimilarly e coli translocation across human peyers patches was reduced 457 by soluble plantain nsp 5 mgml and increased 2fold by polysorbate80 01 volvolconclusions translocation of e coli across mcells is reduced by soluble plant fibres particularly plantain and broccoli but increased by the emulsifier polysorbate80these effects occur at relevant concentrations and may contribute to the impact of dietary factors on crohns disease pathogenesis
