crohns disease is a lifelong idiopathic inflammatory disease which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract and occasionally extraintestinal organscd is thought to result from complex interactions between environmental factors the gut microbes and the genetic background and the immune system of the hostin the last decades research on these pathogenetic components and especially on mucosal immunity has led to the development of biologic agents and therapeutic strategies that have improved dramatically the treatment of cd but we are still far away from curing the diseaseif there is a treatment for cd that will probably evolve through methodical steps towards integrating research on all the components involved in the pathogenesis of cdthis holistic and global approach may aid at unravelling the mysteries of cd and developing novel agents and therapeutic strategies which by targeting multiple pathogenetic pathways and at different stages of disease may lead hopefully to curecopyright  2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
