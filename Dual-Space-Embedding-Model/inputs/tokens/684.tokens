the presence of natural estrogen hormones as trace concentrations in the environment has been reported by many researchers and is of growing concern due to its possible adverse effects on the ecosystemin this study municipal biosolids poultry manure pm and cow manure cm and spent mushroom compost smc were analyzed for the presence of seven estrogen hormones17αestradiol 17βestradiol 17αdihydroequilin and estrone were detected in the sampled biosolids and manures at concentrations ranging from 6 to 462 ngg of dry solids17αestradiol 17βestradiol and estrone were also detected in smc at concentrations ranging from 4 to 28 ngg of dry solidsdesorption experiments were simulated in the laboratory using deionized water milliq and the aqueous phase was examined for the presence of estrogen hormones to determine their desorption potentialvery low desorption of 04 and 02 estrogen hormones was observed from municipal biosolids and smc respectivelyan estimate of total estrogen contribution from different solid waste sources is reportedanimal manures pm and cm contribute to a significant load of estrogen hormones in the natural environment
