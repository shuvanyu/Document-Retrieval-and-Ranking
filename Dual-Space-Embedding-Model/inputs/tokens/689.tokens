background detection of estrogens in the environment has raised concerns in recent years because of their potential to affect both wildlife and humansobjectives we compared exposures to prescribed and naturally occurring estrogens in drinking water to exposures to naturally occurring background levels of estrogens in the diet of children and adults and to four independently derived acceptable daily intakes adis to determine whether drinking water intakes are larger or smaller than dietary intake or adismethods we used the pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation phate model to predict concentrations of estrogens potentially present in drinking waterpredicted drinking water concentrations were combined with default water intake rates to estimate drinking water exposurespredicted drinking water intakes were compared to dietary intakes and also to adiswe present comparisons for individual estrogens as well as combined estrogensresults in the analysis we estimated that a childs exposures to individual prescribed estrogens in drinking water are 730480000 times lower depending upon estrogen type than exposure to background levels of naturally occurring estrogens in milka childs exposure to total estrogens in drinking water prescribed and naturally occurring is about 150 times lower than exposure from milkadult margins of exposure moes based on total dietary exposure are about 2 times smaller than those for childrenmargins of safety moss for an adults exposure to total prescribed estrogens in drinking water vary from about 135 to  17000 depending on adimoss for exposure to total estrogens in drinking water are about 2 times lower than moss for prescribed estrogensdepending on the adi that is used moss for young children range from 28 to 5120 for total estrogens including both prescribed and naturally occurring sources in drinking waterconclusions the consistently large moes and moss strongly suggest that prescribed and total estrogens that may potentially be present in drinking water in the united states are not causing adverse effects in us residents including sensitive subpopulations
