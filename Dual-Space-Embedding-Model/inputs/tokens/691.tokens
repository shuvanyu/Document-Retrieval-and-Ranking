in addition to passive inhalation nonsmokers and especially children are exposed to residual tobacco smoke gases and particles that are deposited to surfaces and dust known as thirdhand smoke thshowever until now the potential cancer risks of this pathway of exposure have been highly uncertain and not considered in public health policyin this study we estimate for the first time the potential cancer risk by age group through nondietary ingestion and dermal exposure to carcinogen nnitrosamines and tobaccospecific nitrosamines tsnas measured in house dust samplesusing a highly sensitive and selective analytical approach we have determined the presence of nicotine eight nnitrosamines and five tobaccospecific nitrosamines in fortysix settled dust samples from homes occupied by both smokers and nonsmokersusing observations of house dust composition we have estimated the cancer risk by applying the most recent official toxicological informationcalculated cancer risks through exposure to the observed levels of tsnas at an early life stage 1 to 6years old exceeded the upperbound risk recommended by the usepa in 77 of smokers and 64 of nonsmokers homesthe maximum risk from exposure to all nitrosamines measured in a smoker occupied home was one excess cancer case per one thousand population exposedthe results presented here highlight the potentially severe longterm consequences of ths exposure particularly to children and give strong evidence of its potential health risk and therefore they should be considered when developing future environmental and health policiescopyright  2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
