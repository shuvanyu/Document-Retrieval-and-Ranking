natural and organic food regulations preclude the use of sodium nitritenitrate and other antimicrobials for processed meat productsconsequently processors have begun to use natural nitratenitrite sources such as celery juicepowder sea salt and turbinado sugar to manufacture natural and organic products with cured meat characteristics but without sodium nitritethe objective of this study was to compare physiochemical characteristics that affect clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes growth in naturally cured and traditionally cured commercial frankfurters hams and baconcorrelations of specific product characteristics to pathogen growth varied between products and pathogens though water activity salt concentration and product composition moisture protein and fat were common intrinsic factors correlated to pathogen growth across productsother frequently correlated traits were related to curing reactions such as  cured pigmentresidual nitrite and nitrate were significantly correlated to c perfringens growth but only for the ham productscopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
