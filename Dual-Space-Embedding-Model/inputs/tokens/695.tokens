background a growing body of evidence shows that secondhand cigarette smoke undergoes numerous chemical changes after it is released into the air it can adsorb to indoor surfaces desorb back into the air and undergo chemical changes as it agesobjectives to test the effects of aging on the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs nicotine and tobaccospecific nitrosamines in cigarette smokemethods we generated sidestream and mainstream cigarette smoke with a smoking machine diluted it with conditioned filtered air and passed it through a 6 m3 flow reactor with air exchange rates that matched normal residential air exchange rateswe tested the effects of 60 min aging on the concentration of 16 pahs nicotine cotinine and tobaccospecific nitrosamineswe also measured sorption and deposition of nicotine cotinine and tobaccospecific nitrosamines on materials placed within the flow reactorresults we observed mass losses of 62 for pahs 72 for nicotine 79 for nnitrosonornicotine and 80 for 4methylnitrosamino13pyridyl1butanone nnkextraction of cotton cloth exposed to smoke yielded nicotine and nnkthe ratio of nnknicotine on the exposed cloth was 10fold higher than that in aerosol samplesconclusions our data suggest that the majority of the pahs nicotine cotinine and tobaccospecific nitrosamines that are released during smoking in homes and public places deposit on room surfacesthese data give an estimate of the potential for accumulation of carcinogens in thirdhand cigarette smokeexposure to pahs and tobaccospecific nitrosamines through dermal absorption and inhalation of contaminated dust may contribute to smokingattributable morbidity and mortality
