type ii diabetic subjects were given 50 g protein 50 g glucose or 50 g glucose with 50 g protein as a single meal in random sequencethe plasma glucose and insulin response was determined over the subsequent 5 h the plasma glucose area above the baseline following a glucose meal was reduced 34 when protein was given with the glucosewhen protein was given alone the glucose concentration remained stable for 2 h and then declinedthe insulin area following glucose was only modestly greater than with a protein meal 97  35 83  19 microu x hml respectivelywhen glucose was given with protein the mean insulin area was considerably greater than when glucose or protein was given alone 247  33 microu x hmlwhen various amounts of protein were given with 50 g glucose the insulin area response was essentially first ordersubsequently subjects were given 50 g glucose or 50 g glucose with 50 g protein as two meals 4 h apart in random sequencethe insulin areas were not significantly different for each meal but were higher when protein  glucose was givenafter the second glucose meal the plasma glucose area was 33 less than after the first mealfollowing the second glucose  protein meal the plasma glucose area was markedly reduced being only 7 as large as after the first mealthese data indicate that protein given with glucose will increase insulin secretion and reduce the plasma glucose rise in at least some type ii diabetic persons
