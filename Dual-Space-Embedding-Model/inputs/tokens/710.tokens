background diets rich in carbohydrates with a low glycemic index and with high fiber content are associated with flat postprandial rises of blood glucose minimal postprandial insulin secretion and maintenance of insulin sensitivityprotective food commodities in the prevention of cardiovascular disease insulin resistance syndrome or diabetes are crucial components of the vegetarian dietaim of the study insulin resistance values were assessed in relation to different nutritionmetabolic abnormality is a predictor of agerelated diseases and can be more pronounced in obese subjectsinsulin resistance values in normal weight subjects of two different nutritional habits were correlated with agemethods fasting concentrations of glucose and insulin as well as calculated values of insulin resistance ir homa were assessed in two nutritional groups of apparently healthy adult subjects age range 19  64 years with normal weight body mass index 186  250 kgm2 a vegetarian group 95 longterm lactoovovegetarians duration of vegetarianism 102  05 years and a nonvegetarian control group 107 subjects of general population on traditional western dietintake of energy and main nutrients fats saccharides proteins was similar in both groupsresults glucose and insulin concentrations and ir homa values were significantly lower in vegetarians glucose 447  005 vs 471  007 mmoll insulin 496  023 vs 732  041 mul ir homa 099  005 vs 159  010ir homa dependence on age was only significant in subjects on a western dieta significant increase of ir was found already in the age range 3140 years compared to vegetarians and it continued in later age decadesage independent and low insulin resistance values in vegetarians are a consequence of an effective diet prevention by longterm frequent consumption of protective foodvegetarians had a significantly higher consumption of whole grain products pulses products from oat and barleyconclusion the results of age independent and low values of insulin resistance document a beneficial effect of longterm vegetarian nutrition in prevention of metabolic syndrome diabetes and cardiovascular disease
