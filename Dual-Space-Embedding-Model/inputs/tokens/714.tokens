the artificial sweetener aspartame laspartyllphenylalanylmethyl ester is consumed primarily in beverages by a very large number of americans causing significant elevations in plasma and probably brain phenylalanine levelsanecdotal reports suggest that some people suffer neurologic or behavioral reactions in association with aspartame consumptionsince phenylalanine can be neurotoxic and can affect the synthesis of inhibitory monoamine neurotransmitters the phenylalanine in aspartame could conceiveably mediate neurologic effectsif mice are given aspartame in doses that elevate plasma phenylalanine levels more than those of tyrosine which probably occurs after any aspartame dose in humans the frequency of seizures following the administration of an epileptogenic drug pentylenetetrazole is enhancedthis effect is simulated by equimolar phenylalanine and blocked by concurrent administration of valine which blocks phenylalanines entry into the brainaspartame also potentiates the induction of seizures by inhaled fluorothyl or by electroconvulsive shockperhaps regulations concerning the sale of food additives should be modified to require the reporting of adverse reactions and the continuing conduct of mandated safety research
