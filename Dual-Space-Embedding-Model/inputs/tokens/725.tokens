objective migratory capacity of endothelial progenitor cells epcs and mature endothelial cells ecs is a key prerequisite for endothelial repair after denuding injury or endothelial damagemethods and results we demonstrate that caffeine in physiologically relevant concentrations 50 to 100 micromoll induces migration of human epcs as well as mature ecsin patients with coronary artery disease cad caffeinated coffee increased caffeine serum concentration from 2 micromoll to 23 micromoll coinciding with a significant increase in migratory activity of patientderived epcsdecaffeinated coffee neither affected caffeine serum levels nor migratory capacity of epcstreatment with caffeine for 7 to 10 days in a mousemodel improved endothelial repair after denudation of the carotid arterythe enhancement of reendothelialization by caffeine was significantly reduced in ampk knockout mice compared to wildtype animalstransplantation of wildtype and ampk bone marrow into wildtype mice revealed no difference in caffeine challenged reendothelializationecs which were depleted of mitochondrial dna did not migrate when challenged with caffeine suggesting a potential role for mitochondria in caffeinedependent migrationconclusions these results provide evidence that caffeine enhances endothelial cell migration and reendothelialization in part through an ampkdependent mechanism suggesting a beneficial role for caffeine in endothelial repair
