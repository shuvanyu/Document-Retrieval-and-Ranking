aims to examine the acute effect of red wine and dealcoholized red wine on endothelial functionmethods and results high frequency ultrasound was used to measure blood flow and percentage brachial artery dilatation after reactive hyperaemia induced by forearm cuff occlusion in 12 healthy subjects less than 40 years of age without known cardiovascular risk factorsthe subjects drank 250 ml of red wine with or without alcohol over 10 min according to a randomized procedurebrachial artery dilatation was measured again 30 and 60 min after the subjects had finished drinkingthe subjects were studied a second time within a week of the first study in a crossover designafter the red wine with alcohol the resting brachial artery diameter resting blood flow heart rate and plasmaethanol increased significantlyafter the dealcoholized red wine these parameters were unchangedflowmediated dilatation of the brachial artery was significantly higher p005 after drinking dealcoholized red wine 5632 than after drinking red wine with alcohol 3622 and before drinking 3925conclusion after ingestion of red wine with alcohol the brachial artery dilated and the blood flow increasedthese changes were not observed following the dealcoholized red wine and were thus attributable to ethanolthese haemodynamic changes may have concealed an effect on flowmediated brachial artery dilatation which did not increase after drinking red wine with alcoholflowmediated dilatation of the brachial artery increased significantly after dealcoholized red wine and this finding may support the hypothesis that antioxidant qualities of red wine rather than ethanol in itself may protect against cardiovascular diseasecopyright 2000 the european society of cardiology
