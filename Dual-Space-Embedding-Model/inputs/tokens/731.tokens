background tea consumption is associated with decreased cardiovascular riskflowmediated dilatation fmd of the brachial artery is related to coronary endothelial function and it is an independent predictor of cardiovascular riskblack tea has a beneficial effect on endothelial function the effect however of green tea on brachial artery reactivity has not been defined yetdesign and methods we studied 14 healthy individuals age 303 years with no cardiovascular risk factors except from smoking 50 on three separate occasions on which they took a 6 g of green tea b 125 mg of caffeine the amount contained in 6 g of tea or c hot waterfmd of the brachial artery was measured before each intervention and 30 90 and 120 min afterwardhighsensitivity creactive protein interleukins 6 il6 and 1b il1b total plasma antioxidative capacity and total plasma oxidative statusstress were measured at baseline and at 120 min after each interventionresults resting and hyperemic brachial artery diameter did not change either with tea or with caffeinefmd increased significantly with tea by 369 peak at 30 min p002 whereas it did not change significantly with caffeine increase by 172 peak at 30 min pnsneither tea nor caffeine had any effect on highsensitivity creactive protein il6 il1b total plasma antioxidative capacity or total plasma oxidative statusstressconclusion green tea consumption has an acute beneficial effect on endothelial function assessed with fmd of the brachial artery in healthy individualsthis may be involved in the beneficial effect of tea on cardiovascular risk
