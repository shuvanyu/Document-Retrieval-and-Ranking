background epidemiological studies suggest that tea consumption decreases cardiovascular risk but the mechanisms of benefit remain undefinedendothelial dysfunction has been associated with coronary artery disease and increased oxidative stresssome antioxidants have been shown to reverse endothelial dysfunction and tea contains antioxidant flavonoidsmethods and results to test the hypothesis that tea consumption will reverse endothelial dysfunction we randomized 66 patients with proven coronary artery disease to consume black tea and water in a crossover designshortterm effects were examined 2 hours after consumption of 450 ml tea or waterlongterm effects were examined after consumption of 900 ml tea or water daily for 4 weeksvasomotor function of the brachial artery was examined at baseline and after each intervention with vascular ultrasoundfifty patients completed the protocol and had technically suitable ultrasound measurementsboth short and longterm tea consumption improved endothelium dependent flowmediated dilation of the brachial artery whereas consumption of water had no effect p0001 by repeatedmeasures anovatea consumption had no effect on endotheliumindependent nitroglycerininduced dilationan equivalent oral dose of caffeine 200 mg had no shortterm effect on flowmediated dilationplasma flavonoids increased after short and longterm tea consumptionconclusions short and longterm black tea consumption reverses endothelial vasomotor dysfunction in patients with coronary artery diseasethis finding may partly explain the association between tea intake and decreased cardiovascular disease events
