objectivesto study the prevalence of arterial diseases in the arteries supplying the lumbar spine and their relation to other vascular diseases as well as to chronic low back painmethodsfive pairs of the lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery were evaluated from 140 postmortem aortograms performed in connection with routine medicolegal necropsies on subjects ranging from 16 to 89 years of agefor information about low back pain history a close relative of each of the deceased was interviewed two to four weeks after the necropsyresultstwenty one 22 men and nine 20 women had occluded arteries and an additional 33 35 men and 17 38 women had narrowed arteriesthe mean age for men with occluded or narrowed arteries or both was 50 years and for women 59 yearsmost of the stenotic changes were seen at the orifices or in the first part of the arteriesthe middle sacral artery was most often affected followed by the fourth lumbar arteriesthe number of collateral arteries increased with occluded p 0001 and narrowed arteries p  0001stenotic lumbarmiddle sacral arteries were found on average five years earlier than atherosclerosis of the coronary arteriessubjects with one or more occludednarrowed arteries were 85 times more likely to have suffered from chronic that is three months or longer low back pain at some time during their life than were those without such findings odds ratio adjusted for age and sex 85 95 confidence intervals 29 24 p 0001conclusionsthe study shows that the lumbar and middle sacral arteries frequently become obliterated by atheromatous lesions during adult life and that obliteration of these arteries is more common in subjects with a history of chronic back pain than in those without
