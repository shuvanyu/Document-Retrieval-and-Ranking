study design a histologic study on agerelated changes of the human lumbar intervertebral disc was conductedobjectives to investigate comprehensively agerelated temporospatial histologic changes in human lumbar intervertebral disc and to develop a practicable and reliable classification system for agerelated histologic disc alterationsummary of the background data no comprehensive microscopic analysis of agerelated disc changes is availablethere is no conceptual morphologic framework for classifying agerelated disc changes as a reference basis for more sophisticated molecular biologic analyses of the causative factors of disc aging or premature aging degenerationmethods a total of 180 complete sagittal lumbar motion segment slices obtained from 44 deceased individuals fetal to 88 years of age were analyzed with regard to 11 histologic variables for the intervertebral disc and endplate respectivelyin addition 30 surgical specimens 3 regions each were investigated with regard to five histologic variablesbased on the semiquantitative analyses of 20250 histologic variable assessments a classification system was developed and tested in terms of validity practicability and reliabilitythe classification system was applied to cadaveric and surgical disc specimens not included in the development of the classification system and the scores were assessed by two additional independent ratersresults a semiquantitative analyses provided clear histologic evidence for the detrimental effect of a diminished blood supply on the endplate resulting in the tissue breakdown beginning in the nucleus pulposus and starting in the second life decadesignificant temporospatial variations in the presence and abundance of histologic disc alterations were observed across levels regions macroscopic degeneration grades and age groupsa practicable classification system for agerelated histologic disc alterations was developed resulting in moderate to excellent reliability kappa values 049098 depending on the histologic variableapplication of the classification system to cadaveric and surgical specimens demonstrated a significant correlation with age   00001 and macroscopic grade of degeneration   0001however substantial data scatter caution against reliance on traditional macroscopic disc grading and favor a histologybased classification system as a reference standardconclusions histologic disc alterations can reliably be graded based on the proposed classification system providing a morphologic framework for more sophisticated molecular biologic analyses of factors leading to agerelated disc changesdiminished blood supply to the intervertebral disc in the first half of the second life decade appears to initiate tissue breakdown
