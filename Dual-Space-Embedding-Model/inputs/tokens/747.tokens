insufficient blood supply to the intervertebral disc ivd has been proposed to play a role as causative factor in ivd degenerationthere is an association between ivd diseases and increased risk of dying of ischaemic heart diseaseobesity and tobacco are potential risk factors for degenerative ivd diseasehigh blood cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels are risk factors for atherosclerosis and could be responsible for a decreased in the blood supply to the already poor vascularized ivdwe performed a frequencymatched casecontrol study to determine the serum levels of patients with symptomatic herniated lumbar discwe examined the fasting serum lipid levels in 384 subjects who were operated at our institutiongroup 1 included 169 consecutive patients 115 men and 54 women mean age 591 years range 2985 who underwent surgery for symptomatic disc herniationgroup 2 control group included 169 patients 115 men and 54 women mean age 61 years range 2686 who underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy for a meniscal tear in the same periodthese patients were frequencymatched by age within 3 years and gender with patients of group 1sera were extracted from blood samples and the concentrations of total cholesterol tc and triglycerides tg were determinedwhen comparing the two groups patients with symptomatic herniated lumbar disc showed statistically significant higher triglyceride concentration p  002 and total cholesterol concentration p  001serum lipid levels may be a risk factor for ivd pathologyan enhanced understanding of these factors holds the promise of new approaches to the prevention and management of ivd pathology
