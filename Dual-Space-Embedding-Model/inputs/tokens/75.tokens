watersoluble polysaccharides were separated from maca lepidium meyenii aqueous extract maethe crude polysaccharides were deproteinized by sevag methodduring the preparation process of maca polysaccharides amylase and glucoamylase effectively removed starch in maca polysaccharidesfour lepidium meyenii polysaccharides lmps were obtained by changing the concentration of ethanol in the process of polysaccharide precipitationall of the lmps were composed of rhamnose arabinose glucose and galactoseantioxidant activity tests revealed that lmp60 showed good capability of scavenging hydroxyl free radical and superoxide radical at 20mgml the scavenging rate was 529 and 858 respectivelytherefore the results showed that maca polysaccharides had a high antioxidant activity and could be explored as the source of bioactive compoundscopyright  2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
