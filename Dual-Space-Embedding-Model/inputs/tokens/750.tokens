diffusion is the only source of nutrition to the intervertebral discs and alteration of diffusion is considered to be the final common pathway for disc degenerationyet diffusion remains poorly understood due to the paucity of reliable methods to study diffusion noninvasively in humans in vivoin recent years postcontrast mri has emerged as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing diffusion in lumbar discssince it is noninvasive and safe it can be used to document the process of diffusion temporally over a period of 24 hourswelldesigned studies have shown that diffusion is a very slow process and that the endplate is the main structure that controls the process of diffusioncontrast mri studies have also made it possible to identify endplate breaks in vivoin the future this technique may be applied to study the influence of smoking mechanical loading of the discs abnormal posture and atherosclerosis of the lumbar arteries on diffusionthese conditions have all been implicated in disc degeneration through a final common pathway of altered diffusion and decreased nutritionthis review article focuses on the current knowledge methodology various factors that influence the diffusion properties of the discs and future applications of this promising techniquec 2007 wileyliss inc
