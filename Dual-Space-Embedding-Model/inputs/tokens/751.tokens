one of the proposed causes of obesity and metabolic syndrome is the excessive intake of products containing added sugars in particular fructosealthough the ability of excessive intake of fructose to induce metabolic syndrome is mounting to date no study has addressed whether a diet specifically lowering fructose but not total carbohydrates can reduce features of metabolic syndromea total of 131 patients were randomized to compare the shortterm effects of 2 energyrestricted dietsa lowfructose diet vs a moderate natural fructose dieton weight loss and metabolic syndrome parameterspatients were randomized to receive 1500 1800 or 2000 cal diets according to sex age and heightbecause natural fructose might be differently absorbed compared with fructose from added sugars we randomized obese subjects to either a lowfructose diet 20 gd or a moderatefructose diet with natural fruit supplements 5070 gd and compared the effects of both diets on the primary outcome of weight loss in a 6week followup periodblood pressure lipid profile serum glucose insulin resistance uric acid soluble intercellular adhesion molecule1 and quality of life scores were included as secondary outcomesone hundred two 78 of the 131 participants were women mean age was 388  88 years and the mean body mass index was 324  45 kgm2each intervention diet was associated with significant weight loss compared with baselineweight loss was higher in the moderate natural fructose group 419  030 kg than the lowfructose group 283  029 kg p  0016compared with baseline each intervention diet was associated with significant improvement in secondary outcomesreduction of energy and added fructose intake may represent an important therapeutic target to reduce the frequency of obesity and diabetesfor weight loss achievement an energyrestricted moderate natural fructose diet was superior to a lowfructose dietcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
