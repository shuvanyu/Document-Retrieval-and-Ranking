the effect of polyphenols phenolic acids and tannins ppts from strawberry and apple on uptake and apical to basolateral transport of glucose was investigated using caco2 intestinal cell monolayerssubstantial inhibition on both uptake and transport was observed by extracts from both strawberry and appleusing sodiumcontaining glucose transporters sglt1 and glut2 both active and sodiumfree only glut2 active conditions we show that the inhibition of glut2 was greater than that of sglt1the extracts were analyzed and some of the constituent ppts were also testedquercetin3orhamnoside ic₅₀ 31 μm phloridzin ic₅₀146 μm and 5caffeoylquinic acid ic₅₀2570 μm contributed 26 52 and 12 respectively to the inhibitory activity of the apple extract whereas pelargonidin3oglucoside ic₅₀802 μm contributed 26 to the total inhibition by the strawberry extractfor the strawberry extract the inhibition of transport was noncompetitive based on kinetic analysis whereas the inhibition of cellular uptake was a mixedtype inhibition with changes in both vmax and apparent km the results in this assay show that some ppts inhibit glucose transport from the intestinal lumen into cells and also the glut2facilitated exit on the basolateral sidecopyright  2010 wileyvch verlag gmbh  co kgaa weinheim
