background sucrose induces high postprandial glucose and insulin responsesin vitro studies suggest that berries may reduce the digestion and absorption of sucrose and thereby suppress postprandial glycemia but the evidence in humans is limitedobjective we investigated the effects of sucrose ingested with blackcurrants ribes nigrum and lingonberries vaccinium vitisidaea on postprandial glucose insulin and free fatty acid responsesdesign twenty healthy women participated in a randomized controlled crossover meal studythey consumed whole blackcurrants or lingonberries 150 g served as pur√©es or blackcurrant or lingonberry nectars 300 ml each with 35 g added sucrosesucrose alone 35 g in 300 ml water was used as a referenceblood samples were collected at 0 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 minresults in comparison with sucrose alone ingestion of sucrose with whole berries resulted in reduced glucose and insulin concentrations during the first 30 min and a slower decline during the second hour and a significantly improved glycemic profileberries prevented the sucroseinduced late postprandial hypoglycemic response and the compensatory free fatty acid reboundnearly similar effects were observed when sucrose was consumed with berry nectarsthe improved responses were evident despite the higher content of available carbohydrate in the berry and nectar meals because of the natural sugars present in berriesconclusions blackcurrants and lingonberries as either whole berries or nectars optimize the postprandial metabolic responses to sucrosethe responses are consistent with delayed digestion of sucrose and consequent slower absorption of glucose
