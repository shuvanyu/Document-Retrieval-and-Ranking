the effect of different classes of dietary polyphenols on intestinal glucose uptake was investigated using polarised caco2 intestinal cellsglucose uptake into cells under sodiumdependent conditions was inhibited by flavonoid glycosides and nonglycosylated polyphenols whereas aglycones and phenolic acids were without effectunder sodiumfree conditions aglycones and nonglycosylated polyphenols inhibited glucose uptake whereas glycosides and phenolic acids were ineffectivethese data suggest that aglycones inhibit facilitated glucose uptake whereas glycosides inhibit the active transport of glucosethe nonglycosylated dietary polyphenols appear to exert their effects via steric hindrance and epigallochatechingallate epichatechingallate and epigallochatechin are effective against both transporters
