background although more than 80 of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in lowincome and middleincome countries knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countriestherefore the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknownmethods we established a standardised casecontrol study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries representing every inhabited continent15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolledthe relation of smoking history of hypertension or diabetes waisthip ratio dietary patterns physical activity consumption of alcohol blood apolipoproteins apo and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported hereodds ratios and their 99 cis for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks par were calculatedfindings smoking odds ratio 287 for current vs never par 357 for current and former vs never raised apobapoa1 ratio 325 for top vs lowest quintile par 492 for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile history of hypertension 191 par 179 diabetes 237 par 99 abdominal obesity 112 for top vs lowest tertile and 162 for middle vs lowest tertile par 201 for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile psychosocial factors 267 par 325 daily consumption of fruits and vegetables 070 par 137 for lack of daily consumption regular alcohol consumption 091 par 67 and regular physical activity 086 par 122 were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction p00001 for all risk factors and p003 for alcoholthese associations were noted in men and women old and young and in all regions of the worldcollectively these nine risk factors accounted for 90 of the par in men and 94 in womeninterpretation abnormal lipids smoking hypertension diabetes abdominal obesity psychosocial factors consumption of fruits vegetables and alcohol and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regionsthis finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction
