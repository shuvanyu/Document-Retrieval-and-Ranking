background previous studies have examined individual dietary and lifestyle factors in relation to type 2 diabetes but the combined effects of these factors are largely unknownmethods we followed 84941 female nurses from 1980 to 1996 these women were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease diabetes and cancer at base lineinformation about their diet and lifestyle was updated periodicallya lowrisk group was defined according to a combination of five variables a bodymass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters of less than 25 a diet high in cereal fiber and polyunsaturated fat and low in trans fat and glycemic load which reflects the effect of diet on the blood glucose level engagement in moderatetovigorous physical activity for at least half an hour per day no current smoking and the consumption of an average of at least half a drink of an alcoholic beverage per dayresults during 16 years of followup we documented 3300 new cases of type 2 diabetesoverweight or obesity was the single most important predictor of diabeteslack of exercise a poor diet current smoking and abstinence from alcohol use were all associated with a significantly increased risk of diabetes even after adjustment for the bodymass indexas compared with the rest of the cohort women in the lowrisk group 34 percent of the women had a relative risk of diabetes of 009 95 percent confidence interval 005 to 017a total of 91 percent of the cases of diabetes in this cohort 95 percent confidence interval 83 to 95 could be attributed to habits and forms of behavior that did not conform to the lowrisk patternconclusions our findings support the hypothesis that the vast majority of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented by the adoption of a healthier lifestyle
