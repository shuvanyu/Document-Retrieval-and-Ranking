background the health positive effects of diets high in fruits and vegetables are generally not replicated in supplementation trials with isolated antioxidants and vitamins and as a consequence the emphasis of chronic disease prevention has shifted to whole foods and whole food productsmethods we carried out a human intervention trial with the golden kiwifruit actinidia chinensis measuring markers of antioxidant status dna stability plasma lipids and platelet aggregationour hypothesis was that supplementation of a normal diet with kiwifruits would have an effect on biomarkers of oxidative statushealthy volunteers supplemented a normal diet with either one or two golden kiwifruits per day in a crossover study lasting 2  4 weeksplasma levels of vitamin c and carotenoids and the ferric reducing activity of plasma frap were measuredmalondialdehyde was assessed as a biomarker of lipid oxidationeffects on dna damage in circulating lymphocytes were estimated using the comet assay with enzyme modification to measure specific lesions another modification allowed estimation of dna repairresults plasma vitamin c increased after supplementation as did resistance towards h2o2induced dna damagepurine oxidation in lymphocyte dna decreased significantly after one kiwifruit per day pyrimidine oxidation decreased after two fruits per dayneither dna base excision nor nucleotide excision repair was influenced by kiwifruit consumptionmalondialdehyde was not affected but plasma triglycerides decreasedwhole blood platelet aggregation was decreased by kiwifruit supplementationconclusion golden kiwifruit consumption strengthens resistance towards endogenous oxidative damage
