effect of aqueous extract of several herbs on human platelet aggregation in vitro was investigatedout of 28 herbsnutriceuticals investigated camomile nettle alfalfa garlic and onion exhibited most significant antiplatelet activity or45 inhibitionaqueous extracts of alfalfa fresh nettle and camomile inhibited adp inducedplatelet aggregation by 73 65 and 60 respectively compared with control p  005camomile and alfalfa inhibited collageninduced platelet aggregation by 84 and 65 respectively but nettle could not inhibit collageninduced aggregationin contrast nettle was the most potent inhibitor 66 of whole blood aggregation induced by collagen followed by alfalfa 52 and camomile 30 compared with control p  005none of these three herbs however could inhibit arachidonic acid or thrombin induced platelet aggregationcamomile and alfalfa strongly inhibited thromboxane b2 synthesis induced by adp or collagen but nettle had no effectalfalfa and nettle increased cgmp levels in platelets by 50 and 35 respectively compared with the control 185  023 nm p  0005all these data indicate that camomile nettle and alfalfa have potent antiplatelet properties and their inhibitory actions are mediated via different mechanisms
