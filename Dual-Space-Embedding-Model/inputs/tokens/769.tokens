background aqueous extracts from tomatoes display a range of antiplatelet activities in vitrowe previously showed that the active components also alter ex vivo platelet function in persons with a high response to adp agonistobjective the objective was to evaluate the suitability of a tomato extract for use as a dietary supplement to prevent platelet activationdesign a randomized doubleblinded placebocontrolled crossover study was conducted in 90 healthy human subjects selected for normal platelet functionchanges from baseline hemostatic function were measured 3 h after consumption of extractenriched or control supplementsresults significant reductions in ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by adp and collagen were observed 3 h after supplementation with doses of tomato extract equivalent to 6 6te and 2 2te tomatoes 3 micromol adpl 6te high dose 213 2te low dose 127 p  0001 75 micromol adpl 6te 78 2te 76 p  0001 3 mg collagenl 6te 175 2te 146 p  0007no significant effects were observed for control supplementsa dose response to tomato extract was found at low levels of platelet stimulationinhibition of platelet function was greatest in a subgroup with the highest plasma homocysteine p  005 and creactive protein concentrations p  0001conclusion as a functional food or dietary supplement tomato extract may have a role in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease by reducing platelet activation which could contribute to a reduction in thrombotic events
