background lifestyle modifications are successfully employed to treat obese and overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcosthe aims of the current pilot study were i to compare the efficacy on reproductive functions of a structured exercise training set programme with a diet programme in obese pcos patients and ii to study their clinical hormonal and metabolic effects to elucidate potentially different mechanisms of actionmethods forty obese pcos patients with anovulatory infertility underwent a set programme set group n  20 and a hypocaloric hyperproteic diet diet group n  20clinical hormonal and metabolic data were assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24week followupsprimary endpoint was cumulative pregnancy rateresults the two groups had similar demographic anthropometric and biochemical parametersafter intervention a significant improvement in menstrual cycles and fertility was noted in both groups with no differences between groupsthe frequency of menses and the ovulation rate were significantly p  005 higher in the set group than in diet group but the increased cumulative pregnancy rate was not significantbody weight body mass index waist circumference insulin resistance indexes and serum levels of sex hormonebinding globulin androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate changed significantly p  005 from baseline and were significantly different p  005 between the two groupsconclusions both set and diet interventions improve fertility in obese pcos patients with anovulatory infertilitywe hypothesize that in both interventions an improvement in insulin sensitivity is the pivotal factor involved in the restoration of ovarian function but potentially acting through different mechanisms
