background natural antithrombotic agents that influence platelet function are of potential interest for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseaseprevious reports showed that tomato extracts inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro but little is known of the active components their mode of action or their efficacy in vivoobjective the objectives of the study were to examine the antiplatelet activity of specific tomato components by in vitro experimentation and to establish their ex vivo efficacy in healthy humansdesign the mechanisms of action of antiplatelet components isolated from tomato extracts were examined in vitroa 7h timecourse study was carried out in cannulated human subjects n  23 to determine the ex vivo efficacy of a supplement drink containing tomato extract and the onset and duration of antiplatelet effectsresults the inhibition of adp collagen thrombin and arachidonatemediated platelet aggregation by tomato extract components appears to be linked to the inhibition of glycoprotein iibiiia and platelet secretory mechanismswe found a significant inhibition of baseline platelet function from 29  14 optimal adp concentrations p  003 to 200  49 suboptimal adp concentrations p  0001 3 h after supplementation with a dose of tomato extract equivalent to 6 tomatoesthe observed effects persisted for 12 h coagulation variables were not affectedconclusions the ingestion of tomato components with in vitro antiplatelet activity significantly affects ex vivo platelet functionthe reported cardioprotective effects of tomatoes are potentially linked to a modulation of platelet function
