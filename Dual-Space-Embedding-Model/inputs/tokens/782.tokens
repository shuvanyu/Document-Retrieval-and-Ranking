the dramatic rising incidence and costs of alzheimers disease ad require that research efforts and funding be primarily directed on either finding a cure or applying preventive measures to curb this disordera cure for ad appears unlikely when significant cognitive loss has occurred because the neuronal networks that controlled the perturbed cognitive abilities are either dead or irreversibly damaged and replacing them even if it were technically possible would not reconstruct the intellectual identity of the hostprevention of risk factors to sporadic ad is a more realistic stratagem and treatment when indicated ideally should begin in cognitively intact individuals as part of a mass screening effortprevention of modifiable risk factors to ad is costeffective because it reduces hospice or hospital stay repeated doctor visits and longterm carepresently neurocognitive and neuroimaging tests are used with partial success in identifying persons at higher risk of ad but these tests can not pinpoint either a cause or a specific intervention that could attenuate disease progresswe previously proposed that carotid artery ultrasound echocardiography together with anklebrachail index causeabi as mass screening tests in asymptomatic persons could detect not only cardiocerebrovascular risk factors to ad but also identify an indicated interventioncauseabi are simple to perform costeffective noninvasive and reasonably accurate for the intended purposeadditionally detection of cardiocerebrovasacular abnormalities long before expression of cognitive deterioration allows higher success rate with earlier treatmentevidencebased medicine is recommended for optimizing clinical decisionmaking in evaluating ad risk factors and their treatment
