diet contributes to over onethird of cancer deaths in the western world yet the factors in the diet that influence cancer are not elucidateda reduction in caloric intake dramatically slows cancer progression in rodents and this may be a major contribution to dietary effects on cancerinsulinlike growth factor i igfi is lowered during dietary restriction dr in both humans and ratsbecause igfi modulates cell proliferation apoptosis and tumorigenesis the mechanisms behind the protective effects of dr may depend on the reduction of this multifaceted growth factorto test this hypothesis igfi was restored during dr to ascertain if lowering of igfi was central to slowing bladder cancer progression during dr heterozygous p53deficient mice received a bladder carcinogen pcresidine to induce preneoplasiaafter confirmation of bladder urothelial preneoplasia the mice were divided into three groups a ad libitum b 20 dr and c 20 dr plus igfi igfidrserum igfi was lowered 24 by dr but was completely restored in the igfidrtreated mice using recombinant igfi administered via osmotic minipumpsalthough tumor progression was decreased by dr restoration of igfi serum levels in drtreated mice increased the stage of the cancersfurthermore igfi modulated tumor progression independent of changes in body weightrates of apoptosis in the preneoplastic lesions were 10 times higher in drtreated mice compared to those in igfdr and ad libitumtreated miceadministration of igfi to drtreated mice also stimulated cell proliferation 6fold in hyperplastic fociin conclusion dr lowered igfi levels thereby favoring apoptosis over cell proliferation and ultimately slowing tumor progressionthis is the first mechanistic study demonstrating that igfi supplementation abrogates the protective effect of dr on neoplastic progression
