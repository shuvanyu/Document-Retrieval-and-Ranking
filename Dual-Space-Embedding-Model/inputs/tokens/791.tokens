background western diets obesity and sedentary lifestyles are associated with increased cancer riskthe mechanisms responsible for this increased risk however are not clearobjective we hypothesized that longterm low protein low calorie intake and endurance exercise are associated with low concentrations of plasma growth factors and hormones that are linked to an increased risk of cancerdesign plasma growth factors and hormones were evaluated in 21 sedentary subjects who had been eating a lowprotein lowcalorie diet for 44  28 y x  sd age 530  11 y 21 endurance runners matched by body mass index bmi in kgm2 and 21 age and sexmatched sedentary subjects eating western dietsresults bmi was lower in the lowprotein lowcalorie diet 213  31 and runner 216  16 groups than in the western diet 265  27 p  0005 groupplasma concentrations of insulin free sex hormones leptin and creactive protein were lower and sex hormonebinding globulin was higher in the lowprotein lowcalorie diet and runner groups than in the sedentary western diet group all p  005plasma insulinlike growth factor i igfi and the concentration ratio of igfi to igf binding protein 3 were lower in the lowprotein lowcalorie diet group 139  37 ngml and 0033  001 respectively than in the runner 177  37 ngml and 0044  001 respectively and sedentary western 201  42 ngml and 0046  001 respectively diet groups p  0005conclusions exercise training decreased adiposity and longterm consumption of a lowprotein lowcalorie diet are associated with low plasma growth factors and hormones that are linked to an increased risk of cancerlow protein intake may have additional protective effects because it is associated with a decrease in circulating igfi independent of body fat mass
