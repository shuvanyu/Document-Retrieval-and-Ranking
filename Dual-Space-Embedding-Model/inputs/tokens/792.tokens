summary reduced function mutations in the insulinigfi signaling pathway increase maximal lifespan and health span in many speciescalorie restriction cr decreases serum igf1 concentration by 40 protects against cancer and slows aging in rodentshowever the longterm effects of cr with adequate nutrition on circulating igf1 levels in humans are unknownhere we report data from two longterm cr studies 1 and 6 years showing that severe cr without malnutrition did not change igf1 and igf1  igfbp3 ratio levels in humansin contrast total and free igf1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderately proteinrestricted individualsreducing protein intake from an average of 167 g kg 1 of body weight per day to 095 g kg 1 of body weight per day for 3 weeks in six volunteers practicing cr resulted in a reduction in serum igf1 from 194 ng ml 1 to 152 ng ml 1 these findings demonstrate that unlike in rodents longterm severe cr does not reduce serum igf1 concentration and igf1  igfbp3 ratio in humansin addition our data provide evidence that protein intake is a key determinant of circulating igf1 levels in humans and suggest that reduced protein intake may become an important component of anticancer and antiaging dietary interventions
