obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the developed worldthe progression from obesity to diabetes mellitus type 2 via metabolic syndrome is recognised and the significant associated increase in the risk of major human cancers acknowledgedwe review the molecular basis of the involvement of morbidly high concentrations of endogenous or therapeutic insulin and of insulinlike growth factors in the progression from obesity to diabetes and finally to cancerepidemiological and biochemical studies establish the role of insulin and hyperinsulinaemia in cancer risk and progressioninsulinlike growth factors igf1 and igf2 secreted by visceral or mammary adipose tissue have significant paracrine and endocrine effectsthese effects can be exacerbated by increased steroid hormone productionstructural studies elucidate how each of the three ligands insulin igf1 and igf2 interacts differently with isoforms a and b of the insulin receptor and with type i igf receptor and explain how these protagonists contribute to diabetesassociated cancerthe above should inform appropriate treatment of cancers that arise in obese individuals and in those with diabetes mellitus type 2novel drugs that target the insulin and insulinlike growth factor signal transduction pathways are in clinical trial and should be effective if appropriate biomarkerinformed patient stratification is implemented
