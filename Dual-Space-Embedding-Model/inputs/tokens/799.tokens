overexpression of growth factors andor their receptors is a common event in malignancy and provides the underlying mechanisms for one of the hallmarks of cancer uncontrolled proliferationmounting evidence suggests that igf1 is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon breast prostate and lunghowever only a few studies have investigated the association between igf1 levels and childhood cancer riskwe aimed to compare the igf1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children and to assess its relationship with cancer type stage metastasis and different disease characteristicsthe study was carried out on 100 children 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control groupthe patients were subjected to a routine workup for their cancers according to our local standardsestimation of the serum level of igf1 was carried out in the two groups using elisaour results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of igf1 than healthy controls of the same age and genderno association was found between igf1 and tumor type stage metastasis and other disease characteristicsin conclusion the igf1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancerit may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategiesgiven the small number of children in our study studies with larger populations are required to confirm these results
