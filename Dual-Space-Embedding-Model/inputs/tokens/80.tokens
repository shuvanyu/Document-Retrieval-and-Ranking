high serum levels of testosterone and estradiol the bioavailability of which may be increased by western dietary habits seem to be important risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancerwe hypothesized that an ad libitum diet low in animal fat and refined carbohydrates and rich in lowglycemicindex foods monounsaturated and n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and phytoestrogens might favorably modify the hormonal profile of postmenopausal womenone hundred and four postmenopausal women selected from 312 healthy volunteers on the basis of high serum testosterone levels were randomized to dietary intervention or controlthe intervention included intensive dietary counseling and specially prepared group meals twice a week over 45 monthschanges in serum levels of testosterone estradiol and sex hormonebinding globulin were the main outcome measuresin the intervention group sex hormonebinding globulin increased significantly from 360 to 451 nmolliter compared with the control group 25 versus 4 p  00001 and serum testosterone decreased from 041 to 033 ngml 20 versus 7 in control group p  00038serum estradiol also decreased but the change was not significantthe dietary intervention group also significantly decreased body weight 406 kg versus 054 kg in the control group waisthip ratio total cholesterol fasting glucose level and area under insulin curve after oral glucose tolerance testa radical modification in diet designed to reduce insulin resistance and also involving increased phytoestrogen intake decreases the bioavailability of serum sex hormones in hyperandrogenic postmenopausal womenadditional studies are needed to determine whether such effects can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer
