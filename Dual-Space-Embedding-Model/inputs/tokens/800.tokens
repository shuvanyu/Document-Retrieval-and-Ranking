the lower rates of some cancers in asian countries than in western countries may be partly because of diet although the mechanisms are unknownthe aim of this crosssectional study was to determine whether a plantbased vegan diet is associated with a lower circulating level of insulinlike growth factor i igfi compared with a meateating or lactoovovegetarian diet among 292 british women ages 2070 yearsthe mean serum igfi concentration was 13 lower in 92 vegan women compared with 99 meateaters and 101 vegetarians p  00006the mean concentrations of both serum igfbinding protein igfbp1 and igfbp2 were 2040 higher in vegan women compared with meateaters and vegetarians p  0005 and p  00008 for igfbp1 and igfbp2 respectivelythere were no significant differences in igfbp3 cpeptide or sex hormonebinding globulin concentrations between the diet groupsintake of protein rich in essential amino acids was positively associated with serum igfi pearson partial correlation coefficient r  027 p  00001 and explained most of the differences in igfi concentration between the diet groupsthese data suggest that a plantbased diet is associated with lower circulating levels of total igfi and higher levels of igfbp1 and igfbp2
