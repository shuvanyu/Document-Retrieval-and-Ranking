pesticides are used throughout the world as mixtures called formulationsthey contain adjuvants which are often kept confidential and are called inerts by the manufacturing companies plus a declared active principle which is usually tested alonewe tested the toxicity of 9 pesticides comparing active principles and their formulations on three human cell lines hepg2 hek293 and jeg3glyphosate isoproturon fluroxypyr pirimicarb imidacloprid acetamiprid tebuconazole epoxiconazole and prochloraz constitute respectively the active principles of 3 major herbicides 3 insecticides and 3 fungicideswe measured mitochondrial activities membrane degradations and caspases 37 activitiesfungicides were the most toxic from concentrations 300600 times lower than agricultural dilutions followed by herbicides and then insecticides with very similar profiles in all cell typesdespite its relatively benign reputation roundup was among the most toxic herbicides and insecticides testedmost importantly 8 formulations out of 9 were up to one thousand times more toxic than their active principlesour results challenge the relevance of the acceptable daily intake for pesticides because this norm is calculated from the toxicity of the active principle alonechronic tests on pesticides may not reflect relevant environmental exposures if only one ingredient of these mixtures is tested alone
