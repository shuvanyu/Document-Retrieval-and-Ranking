the united states us environmental protection agency epa and other regulatory agencies around the world have registered glyphosate as a broadspectrum herbicide for use on multiple food and nonfood use cropsto examine potential health risks in humans we searched and reviewed the literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with noncancer health risks in humanswe also reviewed biomonitoring studies of glyphosate to allow for a more comprehensive discussion of issues related to exposure assessment and misclassificationcohort casecontrol and crosssectional studies on glyphosate and noncancer outcomes evaluated a variety of endpoints including noncancer respiratory conditions diabetes myocardial infarction reproductive and developmental outcomes rheumatoid arthritis thyroid disease and parkinsons diseaseour review found no evidence of a consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between any disease and exposure to glyphosatemost reported associations were weak and not significantly different from 10because accurate exposure measurement is crucial for valid results it is recommended that pesticidespecific exposure algorithms be developed and validatedcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
