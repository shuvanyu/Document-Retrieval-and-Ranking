glyphosate is an active ingredient of the most widely used herbicide and it is believed to be less toxic than other pesticideshowever several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptorthis study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors ers mediated transcriptional activity and their expressionsglyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormonedependent breast cancer t47d cells but not in hormoneindependent breast cancer mdamb231 cells at 10¹² to 10⁶m in estrogen withdrawal conditionthe proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element ere transcription activity were 513 fold of control in t47dkbluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist ici 182780 indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ersfurthermore glyphosate also altered both erα and β expressionthese results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activityglyphosatebased herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein a phytoestrogen in soybeanshowever these additive effects of glyphosate contamination in soybeans need further animal studycopyright  2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
