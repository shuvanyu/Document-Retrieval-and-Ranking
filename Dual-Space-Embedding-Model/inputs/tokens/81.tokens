an optimal diet is one that not only prevents nutrient deficiencies by providing sufficient nutrients and energy for human growth and reproduction but that also promotes health and longevity and reduces the risk of dietrelated chronic diseasesthe composition of the optimal diet for women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos is not yet known but such a diet must not only assist short term with weight management symptoms and fertility but also specifically target the longterm risks of type 2 diabetes cvd and certain cancerswith insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia now recognised as a key factor in the pathogenesis of pcos it has become clear that reducing insulin levels and improving insulin sensitivity are an essential part of managementdiet plays a significant role in the regulation of blood glucose and insulin levels yet research into the dietary management of pcos is lacking and most studies have focused on energy restriction rather than dietary composition per seon the balance of evidence to date a diet low in saturated fat and high in fibre from predominantly lowglycaemicindexcarbohydrate foods is recommendedbecause pcos carries significant metabolic risks more research is clearly needed
