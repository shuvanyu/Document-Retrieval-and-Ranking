glyphosate is the active ingredient of several widely used herbicide formulationsglyphosate targets the shikimate metabolic pathway which is found in plants but not in animalsdespite the relative safety of glyphosate various adverse developmental and reproductive problems have been alleged as a result of exposure in humans and animalsto assess the developmental and reproductive safety of glyphosate an analysis of the available literature was conductedepidemiological and animal reports as well as studies on mechanisms of action related to possible developmental and reproductive effects of glyphosate were reviewedan evaluation of this database found no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspringfurthermore no plausible mechanisms of action for such effects were elucidatedalthough toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosatebased formulations the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposureto estimate potential human exposure concentrations to glyphosate as a result of working directly with the herbicide available biomonitoring data were examinedthese data demonstrated extremely low human exposures as a result of normal application practicesfurthermore the estimated exposure concentrations in humans are 500fold less than the oral reference dose for glyphosate of 2 mgkgd set by the us environmental protection agency us epa 1993in conclusion the available literature shows no solid evidence linking glyphosate exposure to adverse developmental or reproductive effects at environmentally realistic exposure concentrations
