glyphosate is the primary active constituent of the commercial pesticide roundupthe present results show that acute roundup exposure at low doses 36 ppm 0036 gl for 30 min induces oxidative stress and activates multiple stressresponse pathways leading to sertoli cell death in prepubertal rat testisthe pesticide increased intracellular ca2 concentration by opening ltype voltagedependent ca2 channels as well as endoplasmic reticulum ip3 and ryanodine receptors leading to ca2 overload within the cells which set off oxidative stress and necrotic cell deathsimilarly 30 min incubation of testis with glyphosate alone 36 ppm also increased 45ca2 uptakethese events were prevented by the antioxidants trolox and ascorbic acidactivated protein kinase c phosphatidylinositol 3kinase and the mitogenactivated protein kinases such as erk12 and p38mapk play a role in eliciting ca2 influx and cell deathroundup decreased the levels of reduced glutathione gsh and increased the amounts of thiobarbituric acidreactive species tbars and protein carbonylsalso exposure to glyphosateroundup stimulated the activity of glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase glutathione stransferase Î³glutamyltransferase catalase superoxide dismutase and glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase supporting downregulated gsh levelsglyphosate has been described as an endocrine disruptor affecting the male reproductive system however the molecular basis of its toxicity remains to be clarifiedwe propose that roundup toxicity implicated in ca2 overload cell signaling misregulation stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum andor depleted antioxidant defenses could contribute to sertoli cell disruption in spermatogenesis that could have an impact on male fertilitycopyright  2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
