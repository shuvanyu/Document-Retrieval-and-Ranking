to assess human health risk from environmental chemicals we have studied the effect on cell cycle regulation of the widely used glyphosatecontaining pesticide roundupas a model system we have used sea urchin embryonic first divisions following fertilization which are appropriate for the study of universal cell cycle regulation without interference with transcriptionwe show that 08 roundup containing 8 mm glyphosate induces a delay in the kinetic of the first cell cleavage of sea urchin embryosthe delay is dependent on the concentration of roundupthe delay in the cell cycle could be induced using increasing glyphosate concentrations 110 mm in the presence of a subthreshold concentration of roundup 02 while glyphosate alone was ineffective thus indicating synergy between glyphosate and roundup formulation productsthe effect of roundup was not lethal and involved a delay in entry into mphase of the cell cycle as judged cytologicallysince cdk1cyclin b regulates universally the mphase of the cell cycle we analyzed cdk1cyclin b activation during the first division of early developmentroundup delayed the activation of cdk1cyclin b in vivoroundup inhibited also the global protein synthetic rate without preventing the accumulation of cyclin bin summary roundup affects cell cycle regulation by delaying activation of the cdk1cyclin b complex by synergic effect of glyphosate and formulation productsconsidering the universality among species of the cdk1cyclin b regulator our results question the safety of glyphosate and roundup on human health
