roundup is a glyphosatebased herbicide used worldwide including on most genetically modified plants that have been designed to tolerate itits residues may thus enter the food chain and glyphosate is found as a contaminant in riverssome agricultural workers using glyphosate have pregnancy problems but its mechanism of action in mammals is questionedhere we show that glyphosate is toxic to human placental jeg3 cells within 18 hr with concentrations lower than those found with agricultural use and this effect increases with concentration and time or in the presence of roundup adjuvantssurprisingly roundup is always more toxic than its active ingredientwe tested the effects of glyphosate and roundup at lower nontoxic concentrations on aromatase the enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesisthe glyphosatebased herbicide disrupts aromatase activity and mrna levels and interacts with the active site of the purified enzyme but the effects of glyphosate are facilitated by the roundup formulation in microsomes or in cell culturewe conclude that endocrine and toxic effects of roundup not just glyphosate can be observed in mammalswe suggest that the presence of roundup adjuvants enhances glyphosate bioavailability andor bioaccumulation
