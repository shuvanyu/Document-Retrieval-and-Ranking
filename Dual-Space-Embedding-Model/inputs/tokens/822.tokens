pesticides associated to genetically modified foods pagmf are engineered to tolerate herbicides such as glyphosate glyp and gluphosinate gluf or insecticides such as the bacterial toxin bacillus thuringiensis btthe aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between maternal and fetal exposure and to determine exposure levels of glyp and its metabolite aminomethyl phosphoric acid ampa gluf and its metabolite 3methylphosphinicopropionic acid 3mppa and cry1ab protein a bt toxin in eastern townships of quebec canadablood of thirty pregnant women pw and thirtynine nonpregnant women npw were studiedserum glyp and gluf were detected in npw and not detected in pwserum 3mppa and cryab1 toxin were detected in pw their fetuses and npwthis is the first study to reveal the presence of circulating pagmf in women with and without pregnancy paving the way for a new field in reproductive toxicology including nutrition and uteroplacental toxicitiescopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
