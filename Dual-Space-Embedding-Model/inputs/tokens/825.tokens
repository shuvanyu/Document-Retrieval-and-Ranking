the transforming growth factorbeta tgfbeta superfamily encompasses a large group of growth and differentiation factors playing important roles in regulating embryonic development and in maintaining tissue homeostasis in adult animalsusing degenerate polymerase chain reaction we have identified a new murine tgfbeta family member growthdifferentiation factor8 gdf8 which is expressed specifically in developing and adult skeletal muscleduring early stages of embryogenesis gdf8 expression is restricted to the myotome compartment of developing somitesat later stages and in adult animals gdf8 is expressed in many different muscles throughout the bodyto determine the biological function of gdf8 we disrupted the gdf8 gene by gene targeting in micegdf8 null animals are significantly larger than wildtype animals and show a large and widespread increase in skeletal muscle massindividual muscles of mutant animals weigh 23 times more than those of wildtype animals and the increase in mass appears to result from a combination of muscle cell hyperplasia and hypertrophythese results suggest that gdf8 functions specifically as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth
