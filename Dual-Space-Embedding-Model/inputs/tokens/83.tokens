docosahexaenoic acid dha is an omega3 fatty acid that comprises 22 carbons and 6 alternative double bonds in its hydrocarbon chain 226omega3previous studies have shown that dha from fish oil controls the growth and development of different cancers however safety issues have been raised repeatedly about contamination of toxins in fish oil that makes it no longer a clean and safe source of the fatty acidwe investigated the cell growth inhibition of dha from the cultured microalga crypthecodinium cohnii algal dha adha in human breast carcinoma mcf7 cellsadha exhibited growth inhibition on breast cancer cells dosedependently by 160 to 590 of the control level after 72h incubations with 40 to 160 microm of the fatty aciddna flow cytometry shows that adha induced subg1 cells or apoptotic cells by 644 to 1713 of the control levels after incubations with 80 mm of the fatty acid for 24 48 and 72 h western blot studies further show that adha did not modulate the expression of proapoptotic bax protein but induced the downregulation of antiapoptotic bcl2 expression timedependently causing increases of baxbcl2 ratio by 3034 and 3865 after 48 and 72h incubations respectively with the fatty acidresults from this study suggest that dha from the cultured microalga is also effective in controlling cancer cell growth and that downregulation of antiapoptotic bcl2 is an important step in the induced apoptosis
