we studied 19 male patients with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia a control group of 28 healthy men and 44 infertile males before any treatment was undertakenspermiogram seminal biochemical studies measurements of plasma hormone levels and lipid determinations were carried outmost hyperlipoproteinaemic patients showed abnormalities in the spermiograms and the mean values were lower than in the controls except for semen volumeseminal biochemical determinations were normal in the majority and the hormone profile showed some abnormal values mainly for e2lipid abnormalities were more common in azoospermic infertile men and mean lipid levels were highercorrelation studies suggest that high levels of c andor tg are associated with poor semen quality and higher fsh levelsthe results of our studies suggest that high lipid levels exert adverse direct effects at the testicular level
