this study measured 21 persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt pollutants in the us milk supplysince milk fat is likely to be among the highest dietary sources of exposure to pbts it is important to understand their levels in this foodnationwide samples were collected from 45 dairy plants in july of 2000 and again in january 2001the levels of all chemicals in the chlorobenzene pesticide and other halogenated organic groups were determined to be below their detection limits in all samplesnational averages were computed for 11 chemicals or chemical groups found above the detection limitsthe national average cddcdf and pcb teq concentrations were 1430 and 864 pgl respectively for a total of 2294 pglthese levels are about half the values found in a similar study conducted in 1996if this difference is in fact indicative of declining milk levels and assuming exposure levels from nondairy pathways have remained the same over this time period this would result in an overall decrease in adult background dioxin exposure of 14six pahs were detected with national averages ranging from 40 to 777 nglcadmium concentrations ranged from 150 to 870 ngl with a national average of 360 ngllead concentrations were consistently higher than those of cadmium ranging from 630 to 1950 ngl with a national average of 830 nglpahs showed the strongest seasonalgeographic differences with higher levels in winter than summer north than south and east than westaverage adult daily intakes from total milk fat ingestion were computed for all detected compounds and compared to total intakes from all pathways cddcdfpcb teqs 8 vs 55 pgday pahs 06 vs 3 micro gday lead 014 vs 46 micro gday and cadmium 006 vs 30 micro gday
