a retrospective study carried out recently in a large sample of men close to the general population has reported a significant and strong decline in sperm concentration and morphology in the whole of france between 1989 and 2005we studied these trends within each region of francedata were obtained from the fivnat databasethe study sample comprised male partners of sterile women in whom both tubes were absent or blockedthey were located at the assisted reproductive technology centera bayesian spatiotemporal model with parametric time trends adjusted for age was used to model overall time trends for each regionthe results show that sperm concentration decreased in almost all regions of franceamong them aquitaine showed the highest decrease and midipyrénées had the lowest average for the whole periodregarding total motility most regions showed a slight increase while bourgogne showed a steep and significant decreasewhile considering sperm morphology there was a decrease in most of the regionsthe decrease in aquitaine and midipyrénées was stronger when compared with the overall trendin conclusion a decrease in sperm concentration and morphology already shown at the french metropolitan territory level was observed in most regions of francethis is consistent with a global change in environmental exposure according to the endocrine disruptor hypothesis especiallyindeed ubiquitary exposure to chemicals has been growing in the general population of france since the 1950s and the results do not appear to support the lifestyle hypothesisthe highest decreases and lowest values are consistently observed in two proximate regions that are both highly agricultural and densely populated
