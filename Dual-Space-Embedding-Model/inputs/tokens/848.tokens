semen quality appears to have declined in recent decades in some populations egnorthwestern europeat the same time couple fertility may have increasedhypotheses are suggested for this apparent inconsistencyalongside the deterioration of spermatogenesis there is clear evidence of an increase in other related problems notably testicular cancerthe sharply rising trend in this condition started a century agodecades earlier than sometimes thoughtthis and other evidence clearly indicates an environmental origin but there is also a definite genetic componentthe relationship of genetics and environment is discussed in the context of the puzzle that infertility is inherited which appears to be impossible from an evolutionary standpointpoor semen quality is related not only to testicular cancer but also to zygote development in which cancerlike disruption of the genetic apparatus is observed with serious implications for offspring healththis needs to be seen in the context that human reproduction is prone to a higher degree of impairment than that of other mammalian species in relation to spermatogenesis couple fertility early pregnancy loss and embryonic aneuploidy female and malemediated pathways are both implicatedit is unclear whether such human specificity originated on an evolutionarygenetic or a historicosocial timescale which is important in relation to pathogenesisthe evidence clearly indicates that the currently most popular explanation for male reproductive system impairment the endocrine disruption hypothesis cannot explain the main features of the descriptive epidemiologyan alternative pathogenesis is outlined and some possible exposures considered that could be responsible
