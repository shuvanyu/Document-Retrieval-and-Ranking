reactive oxygen species ros have a negative impact on sperm dna leading to the formation of oxidative products such as 8oxo78dihydroxyguanosinethis compound causes fragmentation and thus has a mutagenic effectpatient treatment with oral antioxidant vitamins is therefore standard practice for male infertility in an attempt to decrease formation of ros and improve fertilityin this study the dna fragmentation index and the degree of sperm decondensation were measured using the sperm chromatin structure assay before and after 90 days treatment with antioxidant vitamins associated with zinc and seleniumantioxidant treatment led to a decrease in sperm dna fragmentation 191 p  00004 suggesting that at least part of the decay was linked to roshowever it also led to an unexpected negative effect an increase in sperm decondensation with the same order of magnitude 228 p  00009the opening of interchain disulphide bridges in protamines may explain this aspect as antioxidant vitamins especially vitamin c are able to open the cystin net thus interfering with paternal gene activity during preimplantation developmentthis observation might explain the discrepancy observed concerning the role of these antioxidant treatments in improving male fertility
