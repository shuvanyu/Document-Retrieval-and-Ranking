objective to investigate whether semen quality has changed during the past 50 yearsdesign review of publications on semen quality in men without a history of infertility selected by means of cumulated index medicus and current list 19301965 and medline silver platter database 1966august 1991subjects 14947 men included in a total of 61 papers published between 1938 and 1991main outcome measures mean sperm density and mean seminal volumeresults linear regression of data weighted by number of men in each study showed a significant decrease in mean sperm count from 113 x 106ml in 1940 to 66 x 106ml in 1990 p  00001 and in seminal volume from 340 ml to 275 ml p  0027 indicating an even more pronounced decrease in sperm production than expressed by the decline in sperm densityconclusions there has been a genuine decline in semen quality over the past 50 yearsas male fertility is to some extent correlated with sperm count the results may reflect an overall reduction in male fertilitythe biological significance of these changes is emphasised by a concomitant increase in the incidence of genitourinary abnormalities such as testicular cancer and possibly also cryptorchidism and hypospadias suggesting a growing impact of factors with serious effects on male gonadal function
