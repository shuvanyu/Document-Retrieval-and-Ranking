objective to investigate whether lifestyle factors such as increased dietary intake of micronutrients reduce the risks of sperm dna damage and whether older men benefit more than younger mendesign crosssectional study design with equalized assignments into age groupssetting national laboratory and universitypatients nonclinical group of 2280yearold nonsmoking men n  80 who reported no fertility problemsmain outcome measures sperm dna damage measured by alkaline and neutral dna electrophoresis ie sperm comet assayresults sociodemographics occupational exposures medical and reproductive histories and lifestyle habits were determined by questionnairethe average daily dietary and supplement intake of micronutrients vitamin c vitamin e bcarotene zinc and folate was determined using the 100item modified block food frequency questionnaire ffqmen with the highest intake of vitamin c had approximately 16 less sperm dna damage alkaline sperm comet than men with the lowest intake with similar findings for vitamin e folate and zinc but not Î²caroteneolder men 44 years with the highest vitamin c intake had approximately 20 less sperm dna damage compared with older men with the lowest intake with similar findings for vitamin e and zincthe older men with the highest intake of these micronutrients showed levels of sperm damage that were similar to those of the younger menhowever younger men 44 years did not benefit from higher intakes of the micronutrients surveyedconclusions men with higher dietary and supplement intake of certain micronutrients may produce sperm with less dna damage especially among older menthis raises the broader question of how lifestyle factors including higher intakes of antioxidants and micronutrients might protect somatic as well as germ cells against ageassociated genomic damagecopyright  2012published by elsevier inc
