background shortterm studies in adolescents have generally shown an enhancement of calcium absorption by inulintype fructans prebioticsresults have been inconsistent however and no studies have been conducted to determine whether this effect persists with longterm useobjective the objective was to assess the effects on calcium absorption and bone mineral accretion after 8 wk and 1 y of supplementation with an inulintype fructandesign pubertal adolescents were randomly assigned to receive 8 gd of a mixed short and long degree of polymerization inulintype fructan product fructan group or maltodextrin placebo control groupbone mineral content and bone mineral density were measured before randomization and after 1 y calcium absorption was measured with the use of stable isotopes at baseline and 8 wk and 1 y after supplementationpolymorphisms of the fok1 vitamin d receptor gene were determinedresults calcium absorption was significantly greater in the fructan group than in the control group at 8 wk difference 85  16 p  0001 and at 1 y difference 59  28 p  004an interaction with fok1 genotype was present such that subjects with an ff genotype had the least initial response to fructanafter 1 y the fructan group had a greater increment in both wholebody bone mineral content difference 35  16 g p  003 and wholebody bone mineral density difference 0015  0004 gcm2 p  001 than did the control groupconclusion daily consumption of a combination of prebiotic short and longchain inulintype fructans significantly increases calcium absorption and enhances bone mineralization during pubertal growtheffects of dietary factors on calcium absorption may be modulated by genetic factors including specific vitamin d receptor gene polymorphisms
