background although high soy consumption may be associated with lower breast cancer risk in asian populations findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistentobjective we investigated the effects of soy intake on breast cancer risk among korean women according to their menopausal and hormone receptor statusmethods we conducted a casecontrol study with 358 incident breast cancer patients and 360 agematched controls with no history of malignant neoplasmdietary consumption of soy products was examined using a 103item food frequency questionnaireresults the estimated mean intakes of total soy and isoflavones from this study population were 765 g per day and 150 mg per day respectivelyusing a multivariate logistic regression model we found a significant inverse association between soy intake and breast cancer risk with a doseresponse relationship odds ratios or 95 confidence interval ci for the highest vs the lowest intake quartile 036 020064when the data were stratified by menopausal status the protective effect was observed only among postmenopausal women or 95 ci for the highest vs the lowest intake quartile 008 003022the association between soy and breast cancer risk did not differ according to estrogen receptor erprogesterone receptor pr status but the estimated intake of soy isoflavones showed an inverse association only among postmenopausal women with erpr tumorsconclusions our findings suggest that high consumption of soy might be related to lower risk of breast cancer and that the effect of soy intake could vary depending on several factors
