most research studies in the field of dietary polyphenols or phenolic compounds use a chemical approach focusing exclusively on polyphenols extracted from plant foods with organic solventshowever an appreciable part of polyphenols are not extracted with organic solvents and thus are ignored in biological nutritional and epidemiological studiesrecent studies have shown that these nonextractable polyphenols nepp are a major part of total dietary polyphenols and that they exhibit a significant biological activitya physiological approach is proposed on the basis that the bioavailability and healthrelated properties of polyphenols depend on their solubility in intestinal fluids which is different from their solubility in organic solventsthis paper tries to clarify the concept of nepp distinguishing between chemical and physiological approaches and pointing out the main qualitative and quantitative differences between themit is stressed that the literature and databases refer to only extractable polyphenolsgreater attention to nepp may fill the current gap in the field of dietary polyphenols
