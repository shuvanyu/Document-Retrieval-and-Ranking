nonstarch polysaccharides nsps occur naturally in many foodsthe physiochemical and biological properties of these compounds correspond to dietary fibernonstarch polysaccharides show various physiological effects in the small and large intestine and therefore have important health implications for humansthe remarkable properties of dietary nsps are water dispersibility viscosity effect bulk and fermentibility into short chain fatty acids scfasthese features may lead to diminished risk of serious diet related diseases which are major problems in western countries and are emerging in developing countries with greater affluencethese conditions include coronary heart disease colorectal cancer inflammatory bowel disease breast cancer tumor formation mineral related abnormalities and disordered laxationinsoluble nsps cellulose and hemicellulose are effective laxatives whereas soluble nsps especially mixedlink Î²glucans lower plasma cholesterol levels and help to normalize blood glucose and insulin levels making these kinds of polysaccharides a part of dietary plans to treat cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetesmoreover a major proportion of dietary nsps escapes the small intestine nearly intact and is fermented into scfas by commensal microflora present in the colon and cecum and promotes normal laxationshort chain fatty acids have a number of health promoting effects and are particularly effective in promoting large bowel functioncertain nsps through their fermented products may promote the growth of specific beneficial colonic bacteria which offer a prebiotic effectvarious modes of action of nsps as therapeutic agent have been proposed in the present reviewin addition nsps based films and coatings for packaging and wrapping are of commercial interest because they are compatible with several types of food productshowever much of the physiological and nutritional impact of nsps and the mechanism involved is not fully understood and even the recommendation on the dose of different dietary nsps intake among different age groups needs to be studied
