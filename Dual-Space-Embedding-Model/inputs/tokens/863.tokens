objective to determine whether individual fruits are differentially associated with risk of type 2 diabetesdesign prospective longitudinal cohort studysetting health professionals in the united statesparticipants 66 105 women from the nurses health study 19842008 85 104 women from the nurses health study ii 19912009 and 36 173 men from the health professionals followup study 19862008 who were free of major chronic diseases at baseline in these studiesmain outcome measure incident cases of type 2 diabetes identified through self report and confirmed by supplementary questionnairesresults during 3 464 641 person years of followup 12 198 participants developed type 2 diabetesafter adjustment for personal lifestyle and dietary risk factors of diabetes the pooled hazard ratio of type 2 diabetes for every three servingsweek of total whole fruit consumption was 098 95 confidence interval 096 to 099with mutual adjustment of individual fruits the pooled hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes for every three servingsweek were 074 066 to 083 for blueberries 088 083 to 093 for grapes and raisins 089 079 to 101 for prunes 093 090 to 096 for apples and pears 095 091 to 098 for bananas 095 091 to 099 for grapefruit 097 092 to 102 for peaches plums and apricots 099 095 to 103 for oranges 103 096 to 110 for strawberries and 110 102 to 118 for cantaloupethe pooled hazard ratio for the same increment in fruit juice consumption was 108 105 to 111the associations with risk of type 2 diabetes differed significantly among individual fruits p0001 in all cohortsconclusion our findings suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the associations between individual fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetesgreater consumption of specific whole fruits particularly blueberries grapes and apples is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk
