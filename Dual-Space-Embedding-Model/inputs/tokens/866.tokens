the most important factors leading to fat accumulation in children are genetic inheritance endocrine alterations and behaviouralenvironmental causesin addition experimental animal studies have shown that infections due to various pathogens can lead to overweight and obesity conditions and studies of humans have found that the incidence of seroconversion against some of these may be significantly more frequent in obese adults and children than in normal subjectshowever the results of these studies are not conclusive and in some cases have raised more questions than answerswe reviewed the literature concerning the role of adenovirus 36 ad36 the most widely studied infectious agent in animals and humans because of its potential association with childhood obesitythe available evidence suggests that more studies are needed to evaluate whether or not the association between the presence of ad36 antibodies and obesity is simply unrelated and to verify whether there are subjects that have greater tendency to become obese because more easily susceptible to ad36 infection or with a predisposition to suffer from persistent viral infection more easily leading to the development of obesityif it is demonstrated that ad36 does play a role in obesity it will be important to investigate possible vaccines against the infection itself or antiviral drugs capable of inhibiting disease progressioncopyright  2012 elsevier bv all rights reserved
