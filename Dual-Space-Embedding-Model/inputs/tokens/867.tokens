human adenovirus ad36 is causatively and correlatively linked with animal and human obesity respectivelyad36 enhances differentiation of rodent preadipocytes but its effect on adipogenesis in humans is unknownto indirectly assess the role of ad36induced adipogenesis in human obesity the effect of the virus on commitment differentiation and lipid accumulation was investigated in vitro in primary human adiposederived stemstromal cells hascad36 infected hasc in a time and dosedependent mannereven in the presence of osteogenic media ad36infected hasc showed significantly greater lipid accumulation suggestive of their commitment to the adipocyte lineageeven in the absence of adipogenic inducers ad36 significantly increased hasc differentiation as indicated by a timedependent expression of genes within the adipogenic cascadeccaatenhancer binding proteinβ peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorγ and fatty acidbinding proteinand consequentially increased lipid accumulation in a time and viral dosedependent mannerinduction of hasc to the adipocyte state by ad36 was further supported by increased expression of lipoprotein lipase and the accumulation of its extracellular fractionhasc from subjects harboring ad36 dna in their adipose tissue due to natural infection had significantly greater ability to differentiate compared with ad36 dnanegative counterparts which offers a proof of conceptthus ad36 has the potential to induce adipogenesis in hasc which may contribute to adiposity induced by the virus
