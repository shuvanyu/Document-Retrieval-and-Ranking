objective in 1976 the royal college of physicians and the british cardiac society recommended eating less fatty red meat and more poultry instead because it was leanhowever the situation has changed since that time with a striking increase in fat content of the standard broiler chickenthe aim of the present study was to report a snapshot of data on fat in chickens now sold to the publicdesign samples were obtained randomly between 2004 and 2008 from uk supermarkets farm shops and a football clubthe amount of chicken fat was estimated by emulsification and chloroformmethanol extractionsetting food sold in supermarkets and farms in englandsubjects chicken samplesresults the fat energy exceeded that of proteinthere has been a loss of n3 fatty acidsthe n6n3 ratio was found to be as high as 91 as opposed to the recommendation of about 21moreover the tag level in the meat and whole bird mostly exceeded the proportion of phospholipids which should be the higher for muscle functionthe n3 fatty acid docosapentaenoic acid dpa 22  5n3 was in excess of dha 22  6n3previous analyses had as usual for birds more dha than dpaconclusions traditional poultry and eggs were one of the few landbased sources of longchain n3 fatty acids especially dha which is synthesized from its parent precursor in the green food chainin view of the obesity epidemic chickens that provide several times the fat energy compared with protein seem illogicalthis type of chicken husbandry needs to be reviewed with regard to its implications for animal welfare and human nutrition
