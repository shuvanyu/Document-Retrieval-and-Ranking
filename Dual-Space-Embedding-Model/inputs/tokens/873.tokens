objective ad36 a human adenovirus increases adiposity but improves glycemic control in animal modelssimilarly natural ad36 infection is crosssectionally associated with greater adiposity and better glycemic control in humansthis study compared longitudinal observations in indices of adiposity bmi and body fat percentage and glycemic control fasting glucose and insulin in ad36infected versus uninfected adultsresearch design and methods baseline sera from hispanic men and women n  1400 were screened post hoc for the presence of ad36specific antibodiesindices of adiposity and glycemic control at baseline and at 10 years past the baseline were compared between seropositive and seronegative subjects with adjustment for age and sexin addition to age and sex indices of glycemic control were adjusted for baseline bmi and were analyzed only for nondiabetic subjectsresults seropositive subjects 145 had greater adiposity at baseline compared with seronegative subjectslongitudinally seropositive subjects showed greater adiposity indices but lower fasting insulin levelssubgroup analyses revealed that ad36seropositivity was associated with better baseline glycemic control and lower fasting insulin levels over time in the normalweight group bmi 25 kgm2 and longitudinally with greater adiposity in the overweight bmi 2530 kgm2 and obese bmi 30 kgm2 menstatistically the differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals were modest in light of the multiple tests performedconclusions this study strengthens the plausibility that in humans ad36 increases adiposity and attenuates deterioration of glycemic controlpanoptically the study raises the possibility that certain infections may modulate obesity or diabetes riska comprehensive understanding of these underrecognized factors is needed to effectively combat such metabolic disorders
