background a growing number of preclinical studies have demonstrated that curcumin could be a promising anticancer drug however poor bioavailability has been the major obstacle for its clinical applicationto overcome this problem we developed a new form of curcumin theracurmin and reported high plasma curcumin levels could be safely achieved after a single administration of theracurmin in healthy volunteersin this study we aimed to evaluate the safety of repetitive administration of theracurmin in cancer patientsmethods pancreatic or biliary tract cancer patients who failed standard chemotherapy were eligible for this studybased on our previous pharmacokinetic study we selected theracurmin containing 200 mg of curcumin level 1 as a starting dose and the dose was safely escalated to level 2 which contained 400 mg of curcumintheracurmin was orally administered every day with standard gemcitabinebased chemotherapyin addition to safety and pharmacokinetics data nfÎºb activity cytokine levels efficacy and qualityoflife score were evaluatedresults ten patients were assigned to level 1 and six were to level 2peak plasma curcumin levels median after theracurmin administration were 324 ngml range 471029 ngml at level 1 and 440 ngml range 1791380 ngml at level 2no unexpected adverse events were observed and 3 patients safely continued theracurmin administration for 9 monthsconclusions repetitive systemic exposure to high concentrations of curcumin achieved by theracurmin did not increase the incidence of adverse events in cancer patients receiving gemcitabinebased chemotherapy
