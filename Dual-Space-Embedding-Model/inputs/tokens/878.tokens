epidemiologic studies of diet and pancreas cancer are few and include ecologic comparisons and a limited number of prospective and casecontrol studiesfoods andor nutrients that have been suggested to be associated with increased risk of this cancer include total fat intake eggs animal protein sugar meat coffee and butterconsumption of raw fruits and vegetables has been consistently associated with decreased riskdietary habits and medical history variables were evaluated in a prospective study of fatal pancreas cancer among 34000 california seventhday adventists between 1976 and 1983forty deaths from pancreas cancer occurred during the followup periodcompared to all us whites adventists experienced decreased risk from pancreas cancer death standardized mortality ratio smr  72 for men 90 for women which was not statistically significantalthough there was a suggestive relationship between increasing meat egg and coffee consumption and increased pancreatic cancer risk these variables were not significantly related to risk after controlling for cigarette smokinghowever increasing consumption of vegetarian protein products beans lentils and peas as well as dried fruit was associated with highly significant protective relationships to pancreas cancer riska prior history of diabetes was associated with increased risk of subsequent fatal pancreas cancer as was a history of surgery for peptic or duodenal ulcera history of tonsillectomy was associated with a slight nonsignificant protective relationship as was history of various allergic reactionsthese findings suggest that the protective relationships associated with frequent consumption of vegetables and fruits high in proteaseinhibitor content are more important than any increase in pancreas cancer risk attendant on frequent consumption of meat or other animal productsfurthermore the previously reported positive associations between diabetes and abdominal surgery and pancreas cancer risk are supported in these data
