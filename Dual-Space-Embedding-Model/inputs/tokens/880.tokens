pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and identifying modifiable risk factors could have substantial public health impactin this populationbased casecontrol study 532 cases 1701 controls we used principal component analysis and multivariable unconditional logistic regression models to examine whether a particular dietary pattern was associated with risk of pancreatic cancer adjusting for other known risk factorsa prudent dietary pattern characterized by greater intake of vegetables fruit fish poultry whole grains and lowfat dairy was associated with an approximate 50 reduction in pancreatic cancer risk among men or051 95 ci 031084 ptrend0001 and women or051 95 ci 029090 ptrend004a western dietary pattern characterized by higher intake of red and processed meats potato chips sugary beverages sweets high fat dairy eggs and refined grains was associated with a 24fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer among men 95 ci 1342 ptrend0008 but was not associated with risk among womenamong men those in the upper quintiles of the western diet and lower quintiles of the prudent diet had a 3fold increased riskconsistent with what has been recommended for several other chronic diseases consuming a diet rich in plantbased foods whole grains and white meat might reduce risk of pancreatic cancer
