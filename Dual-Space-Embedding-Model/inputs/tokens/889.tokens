introduction sex steroid exposure increases the risk of breast cancer by unclear mechanismsdiet modifications may be one breast cancer prevention strategythe proinflammatory cytokine family of il1 is implicated in cancer progressionil1ra is an endogenous inhibitor of the proinflammatory il1α and il1βobjective the objective of this study was to elucidate whether estrogen tamoxifen andor diet modification altered il1 levels in normal human breast tissuedesign and methods microdialysis was performed in healthy women under various hormone exposures tamoxifen therapy and diet modifications and in breast cancers of women before surgerybreast tissue biopsies from reduction mammoplasties were culturedresults we show a significant positive correlation between estradiol and in vivo levels of il1β in breast tissue and abdominal sc fat whereas il1ra exhibited a significant negative correlation with estradiol in breast tissuetamoxifen or a dietary addition of 25 g flaxseed per day resulted in significantly increased levels of il1ra in the breastthese results were confirmed in ex vivo culture of breast biopsiesimmunohistochemistry of the biopsies did not reveal any changes in cellular content of the il1s suggesting that mainly the secreted levels were affectedin breast cancer patients intratumoral levels of il1β were significantly higher compared with normal adjacent breast tissueconclusion il1 may be under the control of estrogen in vivo and may be attenuated by antiestrogen therapy and diet modificationsthe increased il1β in breast cancers of women strongly suggests il1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment and prevention
