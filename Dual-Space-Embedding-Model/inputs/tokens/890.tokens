background there are conflicting reports and a lack of evidencebased data regarding effects of medications on cognition in cognitively normal older adultswe explored whether use of 100 common medications taken by older adults is associated with longitudinal cognitive performancemethods a longitudinal observational cohort was used with analysis of data collected september 2005 through may 2011 and maintained in the national alzheimers coordinating center nacc uniform data setparticipants were aged 50 years or older and cognitively normal n4414composite scores were constructed from 10 psychometric testsscores for each participant reflecting change in the psychometric composite score from the baseline clinical assessment to the next assessment were calculatedgeneral linear models were used to test whether the mean composite change score differed for participants who reported starting stopping continuing or not taking each of the 100 most frequentlyused medications in the nacc sampleresults the average time between assessments was 12 years sd042nine medications showed a difference p005 across the four participant groups in mean psychometric change scores from the first to the second assessmentmedications associated with improved psychometric performance were naproxen calciumvitamin d ferrous sulfate potassium chloride flax and sertralinemedications associated with declining psychometric performance were bupropion oxybutynin and furosemideconclusions reported use of common medications is associated with cognitive performance in older adults but studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects
