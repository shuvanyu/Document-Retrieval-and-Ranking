in children omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas may elicit a suite of health benefits including enhancement of cognitive developmentsubsequently dietary supplements containing omega3 pufas have become increasingly popularoften the largest source of beneficial pufas in these supplements is fish oil which may contain significant levels of contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbsthe objectives of this study were to evaluate congenerspecific pcb concentrations in 13 overthecounter childrens dietary supplements containing fish oilspowders and assess potential pcb exposures through ingestion of these products on a daily basisevery supplement analysed contained pcbs with a mean concentration of 9  8 ng pcbsg supplementwhen following serving size suggestions mean daily exposure values ranged from 25 to 503 ng pcbsdaydaily exposures for childrens supplements were significantly lower than those previously reported for adult supplements and may be explained in part by the variability in the amount of fish oil and pufa content in a serving sizebased on this study factors such as fish oil purification methods eg molecular distillation and the trophic level of the fish species used to make the fish oil cannot be used as indicators of pcb levels within childrens supplementsfish supplements may decrease or increase daily pcb exposure compared with ingestion of fresh fishhowever eating fish high in omega3 pufas and low in pcbs may reduce pcb exposure compared with daily supplementation with fish oils for some products studied
