the need for a dietary supply of docosahexaenoic acid dha and arachidonic aid aa in term infants was evaluated in a doublemasked randomized clinical trial of the effects of supplementation of term infant formula with dha 035 of total fatty acids or with dha 036 and aa 072 on visual acuity developmentone hundred and eight healthy term infants were enrolled in the study 79 were exclusively formulafed from birth randomized group and 29 were exclusively breastfed gold standard groupinfants were evaluated at four time points during the first 12 mo of life for blood fatty acid composition growth sweep visual evoked potential vep acuity and forced choice preferential looking acuitysupplementation of term infant formula with dha or with dha and aa during the first 4 mo of life yields clear differences in total red blood cell rbc lipid compositionsupplementation of term infant formula with dha or with dha and aa also yields better sweep vep acuity at 6 17 and 52 wk of age but not at 26 wk of age when acuity development reaches a plateauthe rbc lipid composition and sweep vep acuity of supplemented infants was similar to that of human milkfed infants whereas the rbc lipid composition and sweep vep acuity of unsupplemented infants was significantly different from human milkfed infantsdifferences in acuity among diet groups were too subtle to be detected by the forced choice preferential looking protocolinfants in all diet groups had similar rates of growth and tolerated all diets wellthus early dietary intake of preformed dha and aa appears necessary for optimal development of the brain and eye of the human infant
