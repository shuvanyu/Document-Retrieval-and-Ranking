observations of increasing allergy prevalence with decreasing distance from the equator and positive associations with ambient ultraviolet radiation have contributed to a growing interest in the possible role of vitamin d in the etiology of allergythe aims of this study were to describe any latitudinal variation in the prevalence of childhood allergy in australia and to evaluate in parallel the individual associations between ultraviolet radiation uvr and vitamin drelated measures and hayfever asthma and both conditionsparticipants were populationbased controls who took part in a multicenter casecontrol study aged 1861 yr and resident in one of four study regions ranging in latitude from 27s to 43sdata were derived from a selfadministered questionnaire interview and examination by a research officer and biologic samplinglatitude and longitude coordinates were geocoded from participants residential locations and climatic data were linked to postcodes of current residencestored serum was analyzed for 25hydroxyvitamin d concentrations and silicone rubber casts of the skin were used as an objective measure of cumulative actinic damagethere was an inverse latitude gradient for asthma a 9 decrease per increasing degree of latitude however this pattern did not persist after adjusting for average daily temperaturethere was no association between any of the uvr or vitamin drelated measures and childhood asthma but greater time in the sun in winter between the ages 615 yr was associated with an increase in the odds of having hayfever adjusted odds ratios or 129 95 ci 101163oral supplementation with cod liver oil in childhood increased the odds of a history of having both asthma and hayfever 287 100832further investigation of the possible role of early vitamin d supplementation in the development of allergy is warrantedour results also suggest that solar exposure during childhood may be important in allergic sensitizationplausible explanations including biologic mechanisms exist for both observations 2010 john wiley  sons as
