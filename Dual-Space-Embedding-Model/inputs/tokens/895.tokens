the effect of dietary factors on manganesedependent superoxide dismutase mnsod activity in humans has not been studiedwe longitudinally evaluated changes in mnsod activity and other indices of manganese and iron status in 47 women during a 124d supplementation studysubjects received one of four treatments placebo 60 mg iron 15 mg manganese or both mineral supplements dailymanganese supplementation resulted in significant increases in lymphocyte mnsod activity and serum manganese concentrations from baseline values but no changes in urinary manganese excretion or in any indices of iron statusoral contraceptive use and the stage of the menstrual cycle did not confound the use of lymphocyte mnsod activity or serum manganese to monitor manganese status but fat intake affected both indicesthis work demonstrated that lymphocyte mnsod activity can be used with serum manganese concentrations to monitor manganese exposure in humans
