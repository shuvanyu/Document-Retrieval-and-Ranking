because manganese mn is potentially toxic and because dietary fat type may affect mn absorption the objectives of the current study were to determine whether diets containing very low or very high amounts of mn and enriched in either saturated or unsaturated fats affected measures of neuropsychological and basic metabolic functionhealthy young women were fed for 8 wk each in a crossover design diets that provided 08 or 20 mg of mndone half of the subjects received 15 of energy as cocoa butter and one half received 15 of energy as corn oila meal containing 54mn was fed after 4 wk and subjects underwent wholebody counting for the next 21 d blood draws and neuropsychological tests were administered at regular intervals during the dietary periodswhen subjects consumed the diets low in mn compared with the high mn diets they absorbed a significantly higher percentage of 54mn but had a significantly longer biological halflife of the absorbed 54mnmanganese intake did not affect any neurological measures and only minimally affected psychologic variablesthese data show that efficient mechanisms operate to maintain mn homeostasis over the range of intakes that may be encountered in a mixed western dietthus dietary intakes of mn from 08 to 20 mg for 8 wk likely do not result in mn deficiency or toxicity signs in healthy adults
