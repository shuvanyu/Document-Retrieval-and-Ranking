ten subjects with normal renal function were given different single doses of aluminium containing antacids 1 4 or 8 tabletsthe antacid tablets aluminium content 244 mg tablet1 were chewed and swallowed either with water with orange juice or with citric acid solutionthere was a marked increase in serum concentration of aluminium when the antacids was ingested with citric acid p less than 0001 or with orange juice p less than 005when antacids were taken with water a slight but significant increase in serum aluminium concentration was seen with 4 but not with 1 or with 8 tabletsfollowing all doses of antacid a significant increase in 24 h urinary excretion of aluminium was seenthe estimated absorption of aluminium was 8 and 50 times higher when antacids were taken with orange juice or with citric acid respectively than when taken with waterthus measurable quantities of aluminium are absorbed from single oral doses of antacidsthe absorption is substantially enhanced by concomitant ingestion of citric acid
