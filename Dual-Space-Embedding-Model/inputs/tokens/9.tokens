objective among plant foods grain products legumes and seeds are important sources of phosphorus pcurrent data on p content and absorbability of p from these foods are lackingmeasurement of inÂ vitro digestible p dp content of foods may reflect absorbability of p the objective of this study was to measure both total phosphorus tp and dp contents of selected foods and to compare the amounts of tp and dp and the proportion of dp to tp among different foodsmethods tp and dp content of 21 foods and drinks of plant origin were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometryin dp analysis samples were digested enzymatically in principle in the same way as in the alimentary canal before p analysesthe most popular national brands were chosen for analysisresults the highest amount of tp 667 mg100 g was found in sesame seeds with hull which also had the lowest percentage of dp 6 to tpinstead in cola drinks and beer the percentage of dp to tp was 87 to 100 13 to 22 mg100 gin cereal products the highest tp content 216 mg100 g and dp proportion 100 were present in industrial muffins which contain sodium phosphate as a leavening agentlegumes contained an average dp content of 83 mg100 g 38 of tpconclusion absorbability of p may differ substantially among different plant foodsdespite high tp content legumes may be a relatively poor p sourcein foods containing phosphate additives the proportion of dp is high which supports previous conclusions of the effective absorbability of p from p additivescopyright  2012 national kidney foundation incpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
