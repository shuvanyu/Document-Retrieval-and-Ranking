12 healthy volunteers on a controlled aluminium al diet each consumed a tea infusion 500 ml70 kg body weight with either milk or lemon juice as additives or mineral water following a threeway crossover designthe concentrations of al were determined in the diet mineral water and tea infusions and in plasma samples collected before and up to 24 hr after consumption of tea or water using graphitefurnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry or inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometryconsumption of up to 160 mg al from tea with milk or lemon juice did not increase plasma al levels compared with consumption of approximately 0001 mg al from mineral waterthe results suggest that in the shortterm drinking tea does not contribute significantly to the total body burden of al
