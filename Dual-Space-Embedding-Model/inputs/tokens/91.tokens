background boric acid is a commonly cited treatment for recurrent and resistant yeast vaginitis but data about the extent and mechanism of its antifungal activity are lackingobjectives the aim of this study was to use in vitro methods to understand the spectrum and mechanism of boric acid as a potential treatment for vaginal infectionmethods yeast and bacterial isolates were tested by agar dilution to determine the intrinsic antimicrobial activity of boric acidestablished microbial physiology methods illuminated the mechanism of the action of boric acid against candida albicansresults c albicans strains including fluconazoleresistant strains were inhibited at concentrations attainable intravaginally as were bacteriabroth dilution mics were between 1563 and 6250 mgl and boric acid proved fungistatic also reflected by a decrease in co2 generation prolonged culture at 50000 mgl was fungicidalseveral organic acids in yeast nitrogen broth yielded a lower ph than equimolar boric acid and sodium borate but were less inhibitorycold or anaerobic incubation protected yeast at high boric acid concentrationscells maintained integrity for 6 h in boric acid at 37 degrees c but after 24 h modest intrusion of propidium iodide occurred loss of plate count viability preceded uptake of vital staingrowth at submic concentrations of boric acid decreased cellular ergosterolthe drug efflux pump cdr1 did not protect candida as cdr1 expression was abrogated by boric acidboric acid interfered with the development of biofilm and hyphal transformationconclusions boric acid is fungistatic to fungicidal depending on concentration and temperatureinhibition of oxidative metabolism appears to be a key antifungal mechanism but inhibition of virulence probably contributes to therapeutic efficacy in vivo
