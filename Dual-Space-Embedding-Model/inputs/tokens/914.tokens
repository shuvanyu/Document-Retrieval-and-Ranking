as a hard tissue dental disease dental erosion has a multifactorial etiologythe majority of dental erosion that originates from extrinsic sources is the result of dietary intake particularly acidic beveragesseveral preventive means have been proposed to minimize the damage to the dentition including a reduction in the consumption of causative beverages and the adoption of a specific method of drinking utilizing a straw instead of a cupthis article presents two cases involving the clinical and radiographic features of erosion lesions associated with chronic and excessive intake of acidic carbonated beveragesthese examples embody how drinking patterns influence the formation of erosion lesions in various anatomic locations within the dentitionthe clinical and radiographic evidence presented in this report cautions against the use of nonspecific terms such as cup versus straw and instead suggests implementing a more precise description of the suggested methodin view of the extensive damage inflicted by the chronic excessive intake of carbonated beverages preventive measures are considered to be the only effective course of managementthis article offers illustrative examples of erosion lesions associated with longterm excessive intake of carbonated beveragesthe influence of the drinking methodthat is a straw positioned into the labial vestibule versus a cupon the anatomic location of the erosion lesions will be demonstrated through clinical and radiographic evidence
