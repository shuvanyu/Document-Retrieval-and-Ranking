importance previous studies have suggested an association between vegetarian diets and lower blood pressure bp but the relationship is not well establishedobjective to conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis of controlled clinical trials and observational studies that have examined the association between vegetarian diets and bpdata sources medline and web of science were searched for articles published in english from 1946 to october 2013 and from 1900 to november 2013 respectivelystudy selection all studies met the inclusion criteria of the use of 1 participants older than 20 years 2 vegetarian diets as an exposure or intervention 3 mean difference in bp as an outcome and 4 a controlled trial or observational study designin addition none met the exclusion criteria of 1 use of twin participants 2 use of multiple interventions 3 reporting only categorical bp data or 4 reliance on case series or case reportsdata extraction and synthesis data collected included study design baseline characteristics of the study population dietary data and outcomesthe data were pooled using a randomeffects modelmain outcomes and measures net differences in systolic and diastolic bp associated with the consumption of vegetarian diets were assessedresults of the 258 studies identified 7 clinical trials and 32 observational studies met the inclusion criteriain the 7 controlled trials a total of 311 participants mean age 445 years consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with a reduction in mean systolic bp 48 mm hg 95 ci 66 to 31 p  001 i2  0 p  45 for heterogeneity and diastolic bp 22 mm hg 95 ci 35 to 10 p  001 i2  0 p  43 for heterogeneity compared with the consumption of omnivorous dietsin the 32 observational studies a total of 21604 participants mean age 466 years consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with lower mean systolic bp 69 mm hg 95 ci 91 to 47 p  001 i2  914 p  001 for heterogeneity and diastolic bp 47 mm hg 95 ci 63 to 31 p  001 i2  926 p  001 for heterogeneity compared with the consumption of omnivorous dietsconclusions and relevance consumption of vegetarian diets is associated with lower bpsuch diets could be a useful nonpharmacologic means for reducing bp
