observational and clinical studies suggest that high protein intake particularly protein from plant sources might reduce blood pressure bpto examine the association of dietary protein with bp we analysed data from premier an 18month clinical trial n810 that examined the effects of two multicomponent lifestyle modifications on bpwe examined the association of protein intake with bp and in particular the independent relationship of plant and animal protein with bpmultivariable linear regression analyses were performed with both crosssectional and longitudinal datadietary plant protein was inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic bp in crosssectional analyses at the 6month followup p00045 and 00096 respectivelyfruit and vegetable intake was also inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic bp crosssectionally at 6 months p00003 and 00157 respectivelyin longitudinal analyses a high intake of plant protein at 6 months was marginally associated with a reduction of both systolic and diastolic bp from baseline to 6 months only p00797 and 00866 respectively independent of change in body weight and waist circumferencefurthermore increased intake of plant protein and fruits and vegetables was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension at 6 but not at 18 monthsresults of this study indicate that plant protein had a beneficial effect on bp and was associated with a lower risk of hypertension at 6 monthsour data in conjunction with other research suggest that an increased intake of plant protein may be useful as a means to prevent and treat hypertension
