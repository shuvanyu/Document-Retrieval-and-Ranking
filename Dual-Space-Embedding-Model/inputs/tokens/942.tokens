background several epidemiologic studies found no effect of egg consumption on the risk of coronary heart diseaseit is possible that the adverse effect of eggs on ldlcholesterol is offset by their favorable effect on hdl cholesterolobjective the objective was to review the effect of dietary cholesterol on the ratio of total to hdl cholesteroldesign studies were identified by medline and biological s searches from 1974 to june 1999 and by reviewing reference listsin addition we included data from a more recently published studystudies were included if they had a crossover or parallel design with a control group if the experimental diets differed only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs and were fed for  or 14 d and if hdlcholesterol concentrations were reportedof the 222 studies identified 17 studies involving 556 subjects met these criteriaresults the addition of 100 mg dietary cholesterold increased the ratio of total to hdl cholesterol by 0020 units 95 ci 0010 0030 total cholesterol concentrations by 0056 mmoll 22 mgdl 95 ci 0046 0065 mmoll 18 25 mgdl and hdlcholesterol concentrations by 0008 mmoll 03 mgdl 95 ci 0005 0010 mmoll 02 04 mgdlconclusions dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to hdl cholesterol and therefore adversely affects the cholesterol profilethe advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterolrich foods may therefore still be valid
