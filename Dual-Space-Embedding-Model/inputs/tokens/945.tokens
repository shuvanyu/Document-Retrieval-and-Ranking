background physical inactivity is an important risk factor for many agingrelated diseasesleukocyte telomere dynamics telomere length and agedependent attrition rate are ostensibly a biological indicator of human agingwe therefore tested the hypothesis that physical activity level in leisure time over the past 12 months is associated with leukocyte telomere length ltl in normal healthy volunteersmethods we studied 2401 white twin volunteers comprising 2152 women and 249 men with questionnaires on physical activity level smoking status and socioeconomic statusleukocyte telomere length was derived from the mean terminal restriction fragment length and adjusted for age and other potential confoundersresults leukocyte telomere length was positively associated with increasing physical activity level in leisure time p 001 this association remained significant after adjustment for age sex body mass index smoking socioeconomic status and physical activity at workthe ltls of the most active subjects were 200 nucleotides longer than those of the least active subjects 71 and 69 kilobases respectively p 006this finding was confirmed in a small group of twin pairs discordant for physical activity level on average the ltl of more active twins was 88 nucleotides longer than that of less active twins p 03conclusions a sedentary lifestyle in addition to smoking high body mass index and low socioeconomic status has an effect on ltl and may accelerate the aging processthis provides a powerful message that could be used by clinicians to promote the potentially antiaging effect of regular exercise
