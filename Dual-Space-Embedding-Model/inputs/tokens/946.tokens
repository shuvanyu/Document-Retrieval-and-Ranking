the telomere length is an indicator of biologic aging and shorter telomeres have been associated with coronary artery calcium cac a validated indicator of coronary atherosclerosisit is unclear however whether healthy lifestyle behaviors affect the relation between telomere length and cacin a sample of subjects aged 40 to 64 years with no previous diagnosis of coronary heart disease stroke diabetes mellitus or cancer n  318 healthy lifestyle behaviors of greater fruit and vegetable consumption lower meat consumption exercise being at a healthy weight and the presence of social support were examined to determine whether they attenuated the association between a shorter telomere length and the presence of caclogistic regression analyses controlling for age gender raceethnicity and framingham risk score revealed that the relation between having shorter telomeres and the presence of cac was attenuated in the presence of high social support low meat consumption and high fruit and vegetable consumptionthose with shorter telomeres and these characteristics were not significantly different from those with longer telomeresconversely the subjects with shorter telomeres and less healthy lifestyles had a significantly increased risk of the presence of cac low fruit and vegetable consumption odds ratio 330 95 confidence interval 161 to 675 high meat consumption odds ratio 333 95 confidence interval 154 to 720 and low social support odds ratio 258 95 confidence interval 124 to 537stratification by gender yielded similar results for men however among women only fruit and vegetable consumption attenuated the shorter telomere length and cac relationin conclusion the results of the present study suggest that being involved in healthy lifestyle behaviors might attenuate the association between shorter telomere length and coronary atherosclerosis as identified using cac2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
