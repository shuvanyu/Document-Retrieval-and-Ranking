dietary factors including dietary fat may affect the biological aging process as reflected by the shortening of telomere length tl by affecting levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory responseswe examined the direct relations of total and types of dietary fats and fatrich foods to peripheral leukocyte tlin 4029 apparently healthy postmenopausal women who participated in the womens health initiative intakes of total fat individual fatty acids and fatrich foods were assessed by a questionnairetl was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reactionintake of shorttomediumchain saturated fatty acids smsfas aliphatic tails of 12 carbons was inversely associated with tlcompared with participants in other quartiles of smsfa intake women who were in the highest quartile median 129 of energy had shorter tls mean 400 kb 95 ci 389 411 kb whereas women in the lowest quartile of intake median 029 of energy had longer tls mean 413 kb 95 ci 403 424 kb ptrend  0046except for lauric acid all other individual smsfas were inversely associated with tl p  005in isoenergetic substitution models the substitution of 1 of energy from smsfas with any other energy source was associated with 119 bp longer tls 95 ci 21 216 bpintakes of nonskim milk butter and wholemilk cheese major sources of smsfas were all inversely associated with tlno significant associations were found with longchain saturated fatty acids monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acidsin conclusion we found that higher intakes of smsfas and smsfarich foods were associated with shorter peripheral leukocyte tl among postmenopausal womenthese findings suggest the potential roles of smsfas in the rate of biological aging
