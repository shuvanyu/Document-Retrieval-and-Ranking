cellular senescence is an in vivo and in vitro phenomenon accompanied by physiological changes including cessation of division and disturbances of organelle structure and functionreview of the literature was undertaken to determine whether there is evidence that whole organism aging and cell senescence share a common initiation pathwayin vivo aged cells of different lineages including aged t lymphocytes show high expression of the ink4ap16 genein cell culture when telomeres are shortened past a key length or state the arfink gene system p16p14 humans p16p19 mice switches on and activates p53 which suppresses further cell divisionthe p53 gene is a key tumor suppressor and its deletion or mutation allows cancerous growththe switching on of p53 also causes changes in fatty acid metabolism especially downregulation of both fatty acid synthase and stearoylcoa delta9 desaturasethe cosuppression of these genes together with enhanced uptake of extracellular fatty acids leads to raised levels of cellular palmitate and induction of either apoptosis or senescencein senescent cells the fatty acid composition of the cellular membranes alters and leads to changes in both structure and function of organelles especially mitochondriaanimal models of accelerated aging exhibit repression of stearoylcoa desaturase activity while antiaging calorie restriction stimulates the same enzyme systemit is concluded that aging in cells and whole organisms share a common initiation pathway and that cellular senescence is protective against cancerhealthy longevity is likely to be most enhanced by factors that actively suppress excessive cell division
