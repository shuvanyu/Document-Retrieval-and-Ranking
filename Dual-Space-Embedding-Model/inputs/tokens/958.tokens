caregivers of alzheimers disease patients endure chronic stress associated with a decline of immune functionto assess the psychological and immunological changes of caregivers we compared depressive symptoms pbmc composition in vitro activationinduced proliferation and cytokine production and telomere length and telomerase activity of 82 individuals 41 caregivers and 41 age and gendermatched controlswe found depressive symptoms were significantly higher in caregivers than in controls p  0001correspondingly caregivers had significantly lower t cell proliferation but higher production of immuneregulatory cytokines tnfÎ± and il10 than controls in response to stimulation in vitrowe examined the impact of these changes on cellular replicative lifespan and found that caregivers had significantly shorter telomere lengths in pbmc than controls 62 and 64 kb respectively p  005 with similar shortening in isolated t cells and monocytes and that this telomere attrition in caregivers was not due to an increase of shorter telomere possessing t cell subsets in pbmcfinally we showed that basal telomerase activity in pbmc and t cells was significantly higher in caregivers than in controls p  00001 pointing to an unsuccessful attempt of cells to compensate the excessive loss of telomeres in caregiversthese findings demonstrate that chronic stress is associated with altered t cell function and accelerated immune cell aging as suggested by excessive telomere loss
