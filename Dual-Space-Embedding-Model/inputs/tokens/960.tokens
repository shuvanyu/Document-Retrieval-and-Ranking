numerous studies demonstrate links between chronic stress and indices of poor health including risk factors for cardiovascular disease and poorer immune functionnevertheless the exact mechanisms of how stress gets under the skin remain elusivewe investigated the hypothesis that stress impacts health by modulating the rate of cellular aginghere we provide evidence that psychological stress both perceived stress and chronicity of stressis significantly associated with higher oxidative stress lower telomerase activity and shorter telomere length which are known determinants of cell senescence and longevity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy premenopausal womenwomen with the highest levels of perceived stress have telomeres shorter on average by the equivalent of at least one decade of additional aging compared to low stress womenthese findings have implications for understanding how at the cellular level stress may promote earlier onset of agerelated diseases
