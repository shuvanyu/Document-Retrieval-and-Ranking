objective to examine whether an association exists between maternal dietary patterns and risk of preterm deliverydesign prospective cohort studysetting norway between 2002 and 2008participants 66â€‰000 pregnant women singletons answered food frequency questionnaire no missing information about parity or previously preterm delivery pregnancy duration between 220 and 416 gestational weeks no diabetes first enrolment pregnancymain outcome measure hazard ratio for preterm delivery according to level of adherence to three distinct dietary patterns interpreted as prudent for example vegetables fruits oils water as beverage whole grain cereals fibre rich bread western salty and sweet snacks white bread desserts processed meat products and traditional potatoes fishresults after adjustment for covariates high scores on the prudent pattern were associated with significantly reduced risk of preterm delivery hazard ratio for the highest versus the lowest third 088 95 confidence interval 080 to 097the prudent pattern was also associated with a significantly lower risk of late and spontaneous preterm deliveryno independent association with preterm delivery was found for the western patternthe traditional pattern was associated with reduced risk of preterm delivery for the highest versus the lowest third hazard ratio 091 083 to 099conclusion this study showed that women adhering to a prudent or a traditional dietary pattern during pregnancy were at lower risk of preterm delivery compared with other womenalthough these findings cannot establish causality they support dietary advice to pregnant women to eat a balanced diet including vegetables fruit whole grains and fish and to drink waterour results indicate that increasing the intake of foods associated with a prudent dietary pattern is more important than totally excluding processed food fast food junk food and snacks
