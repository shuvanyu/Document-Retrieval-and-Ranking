the us food and drug administration fda terminated the use of ball clay from a mine in mississippi as an additive in animal feed after discovering nanogram per gram concentrations of 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin 2378tcddthe fda collected chicken eggs and farmraised catfish in affected areas and throughout the remaining continental united states to assess levels of 2378tcdda new method using quadrupole ion storage tandemintime mass spectrometry qistms measured the 2378tcdd levels in 42 catfish fillet composites 3 tilapia fillet composites 46 chicken egg samples and 6 chicken feedssix catfish composites and 20 egg samples had 2378tcdd concentrations significantly above 10 pgg wet weight of fillet or whole eggfarmraised catfish not exposed to feed containing ball clay had a mean 2378tcdd concentration of 012 pggthe tcdd isomer pattern in ball clay differed from the tcdd isomer pattern in a fly ash sample and from the chick edema factor tcdd pattern in a sample of reference toxic fat used as a feed ingredient in the 1950s
