individualbased studies that investigated the relation between dietary alphalinolenic acid ala intake and prostate cancer risk have shown inconsistent resultswe carried out a metaanalysis of prospective studies to examine this associationwe systematically searched studies published up to december 2008log relative risks rrs were weighted by the inverse of their variances to obtain a pooled estimate with its 95 confidence interval ciwe identified five prospective studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported risk estimates by categories of ala intakecomparing the highest to the lowest ala intake category the pooled rr was 097 95 ci086110 but the association was heterogeneoususing the reported numbers of cases and noncases in each category of ala intake we found that subjects who consumed more than 15 gday of ala compared with subjects who consumed less than 15 gday had a significant decreased risk of prostate cancer rr  095 95 ci091099divergences in results could partly be explained by differences in sample sizes and adjustment but they also highlight limits in dietary ala assessment in such prospective studiesour findings support a weak protective association between dietary ala intake and prostate cancer risk but further research is needed to conclude on this question
