nine catfish fillets three catfish nuggets two feed samples and one pond sediment were analyzed for pcdd pcdf and pcbfarmraised catfish from mississippi alabama and arkansas contained significant levels of 2378substituted pcdd and pcdfin addition a large number of non2378substituted congeners were present in all samplesthe catfish fillets and catfish nuggets also contained high concentrations of dioxinlike pcb as well as a number of nondioxinlike pcbthe teq based on pcdd and pcdf ranged from 95 to 430 pgg lipid and the teq based on pcb ranged from 045 to 49 pgg lipid for all catfish samplesthe dioxinlike pcb contributed 416 to the total teq pcddpcdfpcb for the catfish samplesthe major source for the pcdd pcdf and pcb appears to be from feed and not from pond sedimentimmunoreactive cyp1a protein was elevated 25 fold in the pondraised catfish compared to the aquariumraised onethe results of this study suggest that the pcddpcdf are more important than the pcb in the cyp1a induction
