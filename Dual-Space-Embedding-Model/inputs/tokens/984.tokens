the concentrations of the 2378cl substituted dibenzopdioxinsfurans pcddspcdfs were determined in the edible tissues of whole chicken fryers and compared with the values found in their abdominal fatthe values are presented both on a whole weight basis and on a lipid adjusted basis for each tissuewhile there is a marked difference in the concentration of the 2378dibenzopdioxins in the edible tissues expressed on a whole weight basis the lipidadjusted concentrations of the individual dioxins were not statistically different in the various tissuesthis validates the use of lipid adjusted concentrations of 2378pcddspcdfs in abdominal fat for the determination of the presence of these compounds in different tissues
