in 1994 we analyzed 43 foodstuff samples from local supermarkets in southern mississippi usa for pcddpcdf2378cl4dd could be quantified in 31 of these sampleson a lipid basis levels in meat 053110 pg iteqg and dairy products 042110 pg iteqg were slightly lower than those reported from other industrialized countrieswhile levels in dairy samples from the united states and europe are comparable there is a difference in the contribution of individual congeners to the iteq for example in milk samples from germany approximately 40 of the iteq is due to the presence of 23 478cl5df while in the mississippi samples this congener only contributes 16the highest concentrations of pcddpcdf in our study were detected in the farmraised catfish 102278 pg iteqga unique finding was that in addition to the 2378substituted pcddpcdf the catfish samples contained many non2378substituted congenersthis is unusual because vertebrate animals selectively eliminate or metabolize the non2378substituted congeners
