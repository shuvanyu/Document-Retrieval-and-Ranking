attempts to estimate the effects of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol by metaanalysis have not previously included baseline together with added dietary cholesterol in a mathematical modelmean reported changes in serum cholesterol from 27 studies in which controlled diets were supplied by a metabolic kitchen provided 76 data points each weighted by the number of subjects in nonlinear regressiona good fit to the data p less than 00005 and r  0617 between observed and predicted points was given by the equation y  122e000384 chi 0 1e00136 chi where y is the change in serum cholesterol in mmoll chi is added dietary cholesterol and chi 0 is baseline dietary cholesterol both in mgdpossible reasons for the hyperbolic shape of the relationship between change in serum cholesterol and added dietary cholesterol mechanisms for individual responsiveness to dietary cholesterol and important implications regarding interpretation of prior studies and public health issues are discussed
