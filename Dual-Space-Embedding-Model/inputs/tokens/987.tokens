our aim was to determine the effects of increasing amounts of dietary cholesterol 0710 mg on the postprandial plasma lipid responses and lipoprotein changes in normolipidemic human subjectsten subjects were fed five different test meals in a random order one meal did not contain fat or cholesterol while the four others contained a fixed amount of lipids 45 g and 0 140 280 and 710 mg cholesterol respectivelyfasting and postmeal blood samples were obtained for 7 h large and small triglyceriderich lipoproteins trl low density ldl and high density hdl lipoproteins were isolatedcompared to the nofat nocholesterol meal the fatenriched meals raised p  005 plasma triglycerides phospholipids and free cholesterol and lowered cholesteryl esters postprandiallythe meals containing zero or 140 mg cholesterol generally elicited comparable postprandial plasma and lipoprotein lipid responsesthe meals providing 280 or 710 mg cholesterol significantly increased postprandial plasma phospholipids and large trl triglycerides and decreased plasma esterified cholesterolthe lipid composition of the large trls and the concentrations of the small trl lipid components were not altered postprandially by cholesterol intakeon the other hand ldl free cholesterol increased after 3 h ldl cholesteryl esters dropped after 3 and 7 h hdl cholesteryl esters dropped after 3 h and hdl phospholipids increased 7 h after ingesting meals highly enriched in cholesterolblood insulin apoai and apob were not altered postprandially by cholesterol intakethus the data show that ingesting more than 140 mg cholesterol per meal significantly alters the postprandial lipoprotein response in healthy subjects
