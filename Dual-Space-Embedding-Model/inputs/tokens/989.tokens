context nearly 80 of antibiotics in the united states are sold for use in livestock feedsthe manure produced by these livestock contains antibioticresistant bacteria resistance genes and antibiotics and is subsequently applied to crop fields where it may put community members at risk for antibioticresistant infectionsobjective to assess the association between individual exposure to swine and dairyveal industrial agriculture and risk of methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa infectiondesign setting and participants a populationbased nested casecontrol study of geisinger primary care patients in pennsylvania from 20052010incident mrsa cases were identified using electronic health records classified as communityassociated or healthcareassociated and frequencymatched to randomly selected controls and patients with skin and soft tissue infectionnutrient management plans were used to create two exposure variables seasonal crop field manure application and number of livestock at the operationin a substudy we collected 200 isolates from patients stratified by location of diagnosis and proximity to livestock operationsmain outcome measures communityassociated mrsa healthcare associatedmrsa and skin and soft tissue infection status with no history of mrsa compared to controlsresults from 446480 patients 1539 communityassociated mrsa 1335 healthcareassociated mrsa 2895 skin and soft tissue infection cases and 2914 controls were includedafter adjustment for mrsa risk factors the highest quartile of swine crop field exposure was significantly associated with communityassociated mrsa healthcareassociated mrsa and skin and soft tissue infection case status adjusted odds ratio 138 95 ci 113169 130 95 ci 105161 and 137 95 ci 118160 respectively and there was a trend of increasing odds across quartiles for each outcome all p for trend 001there were similar but weaker associations of swine operations with communityassociated mrsa and skin and soft tissue infectionmolecular testing of 200 isolates identified 31 unique spa types none of which corresponded to cc398 but some have been previously found in swineconclusion proximity to swine manure application to crop fields and livestock operations each was associated with mrsa and skin and soft tissue infectionthese findings contribute to the growing concern about the potential public health impacts of highdensity livestock production
