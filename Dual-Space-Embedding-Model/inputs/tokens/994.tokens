methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa is a pathogen that has developed resistance to betalactam antibiotics and has been isolated at low population numbers in retail meat productsthe objectives of this study were to estimate the potential transfer of mrsa from contaminated retail pork products to food contact surfaces and to estimate the potential for human exposure to mrsa by contact with those contaminated surfacespork loins bacon and fresh pork sausage were inoculated with a fourstrain mixed mrsa culture over a range of populations from approximately 4 to 8 log vacuum packaged and stored for 2 weeks at 5c to simulate normal packaging and distributionprimary transfer was determined by placing inoculated products on knife blades cutting boards and a human skin model pork skin for 5 minsecondary transfer was determined by placing an inoculated product on the contact surface removing it and then placing the secondary contact surface on the initial contact surfacea pork skin model was used to simulate transfer to human skin by placing it into contact with the contact surfacethe percentages of transfer for primary transfer from the inoculated products to the cutting board ranged from 39 to 49 while the percentages of transfer to the knife ranged from 17 to 42the percentages of transfer from the inoculated products to the pork skin ranged from 26 to 36the secondary transfer percentages ranged from 22 to 52 across all products and contact surfacesstatistical analysis showed no significant differences in the amounts of transfer between transfer surfaces and across cell concentrations
