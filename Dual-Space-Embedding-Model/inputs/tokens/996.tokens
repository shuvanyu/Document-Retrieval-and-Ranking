background overweight in adults is associated with increased morbidity and mortalityin contrast the longterm effect of overweight in adolescence on morbidity and mortality is not knownmethods we studied the relation between overweight and morbidity and mortality in 508 lean or overweight adolescents 13 to 18 years old who participated in the harvard growth study of 1922 to 1935overweight adolescents were defined as those with a bodymass index that on two occasions was greater than the 75th percentile in subjects of the same age and sex in a large national surveylean adolescents were defined as those with a bodymass index between the 25th and 50th percentilessubjects who were still alive were interviewed in 1988 to obtain information about their medical history weight functional capacity and other risk factorsfor those who had died information on the cause of death was obtained from death certificatesresults overweight in adolescent subjects was associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes and diseasespecific mortality among men but not among womenthe relative risks among men were 18 95 percent confidence interval 12 to 27 p  0004 for mortality from all causes and 23 95 percent confidence interval 14 to 41 p  0002 for mortality from coronary heart diseasethe risk of morbidity from coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis was increased among men and women who had been overweight in adolescencethe risk of colorectal cancer and gout was increased among men and the risk of arthritis was increased among women who had been overweight in adolescenceoverweight in adolescence was a more powerful predictor of these risks than overweight in adulthoodconclusions overweight in adolescence predicted a broad range of adverse health effects that were independent of adult weight after 55 years of followup
