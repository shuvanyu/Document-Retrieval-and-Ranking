            "Rank 1: 80w0wu9e [The impact of COVID-19 on African American communities in the United States] - IMPORTANCE: The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic in March 2020, may present with disproportionately higher rates in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority populations in the United States, including African American communities who have traditionally been over-represented in negative health outcomes. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. SETTING: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. PARTICIPANTS: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. RESULTS: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). CONCLUSION: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.\n",

These disparities are not new, but are rooted in structural inequities that must be addressed to adequately care for communities of color. We describe the historical context of these structural inequities, their impact on the progression of COVID-19 in the African American (Black) community, and suggest a multifaceted approach to addressing these healthcare disparities. Of note, terminology from survey data cited for this article varied from Blacks, African Americans or both; for consistency, we use African Americans throughout.\n",

A multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy. Gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment. To elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 vary in African Americans as compared to European Americans, we re-mine The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-Seq data. Multiple genes integral to infection, inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations. Most notably, F8A2 and F8A3, which encode the HAP40 protein that mediates early endosome movement in Huntington’s Disease, are more highly expressed by up to 24-fold in African Americans. Such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. We advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code, education level, and profession (as a proxies for socioeconomic condition) and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies. This relatively simple change would enable large-scale data-driven approaches to dissect relationships among race, socio-economic factors, and disease.\n",

Objective: To investigate whether state-imposed stay-at-home orders, African American population in the state, state poverty and other state socio-demographic characteristics, were associated with the state-level incidence of COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, Participants: State-level, aggregated, publicly available data on positive COVID-19 cases and tests were used. The period considered was March 1st -May 4th. All U.S. states except Washington were included. Outcomes of interest were daily cumulative and daily incremental COVID-19 infection rates. Outcomes were log-transformed. Log-linear regression models with a quadratic time-trend and random intercepts for states were estimated. Covariates included log-transformed test-rates, a binary indicator for stay-at-home, percentage of African American, poverty, percentage elderly, state population and prevalence of selected comorbidities. Binary fixed effects for date each state first started reporting test data were included. Results: Stay-at-home orders were associated with decreases in cumulative ({beta}:-1.23; T-stat: -6.84) and daily ({beta}:-0.46; T-stat: -2.56) infection-rates. Predictive analyses indicated that expected cumulative infection rates would be 3 times higher and expected daily incremental rates about 60% higher in absence of stay-at-home orders. Higher African American population was associated with higher cumulative ({beta}: 0.08; T-stat: 4.01) and daily ({beta}: 0.06; T-stat: 3.50) rates. State poverty rates had mixed results and were not robust to model specifications. There was strong evidence of a quadratic daily trend for cumulative and daily rates. Results were largely robust to alternate specifications. Conclusions: We find evidence that stay-at-home orders, which were widely supported by public-health experts, helped to substantially curb COVID-19 infection-rates. As we move to a phased re-opening, continued precautions advised by public-health experts should be adhered to. Also, a larger African American population is strongly associated with incidence of COVID-19 infection. Policies and resources to help mitigate African American vulnerability to COVID-19 is an urgent public health and social justice issue, especially since the ongoing mass protests against police brutality may further exacerbate COVID-19 contagion in this community.\n",

There are a multitude of factors that may explain the African American disparity in COVID-19 outcomes, including higher rates of comorbidities. While individual-level factors predictably contribute to disparate COVID-19 outcomes, systematic and structural factors have not yet been reported. It stands to reason that implicit biases may fuel the racial disparity in COVID-19 outcomes. To address this racial disparity, we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for African Americans, as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health-care system.\n",

From March 19 to May 15, more Detroiters died in 2 months than were killed in 2 years of city homicides. African Americans or Blacks (highest-risk phenotypes) developing COVID-19 infection are more likely to die disproportionately. The confluence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and the higher prevalence of obesity among Blacks have provided the needed environment for viruses like COVID-19 to thrive and cause serious infections. The purpose of this study is to connect mortality rates from COVID-19 infection to increasing obesity trends among African Americans within the city of Detroit. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS ver. 23. Results showed that the highest mortality rates among African Americans occurred more in the obese individuals infected with COVID-19 in the city of Detroit. Out of 1930 deaths from COVID-19 infections, 733 deaths were due to obesity alone in patients without reported comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Mortality rate for both male and female African Americans amounted to a total of 11.9%. Thirty-eight percent of reported COVID-19-infected African Americans were obese.

OBJECTIVE We compared disease-specific characteristics, treatment efficacy, and safety outcomes by sex and race and/or ethnicity in patients treated with RFA for BE. DESIGN The U.S. RFA patient registry is a multicenter collaboration reporting processes and outcomes of care for patients treated with RFA for BE. PATIENTS Patients enrolled with BE. INTERVENTIONS RFA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS We assessed safety (stricture, bleeding, perforation, hospitalization), efficacy (complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia [CEIM]), complete eradication of dysplasia, and number of treatments to CEIM by sex and race and/or ethnicity. RESULTS Among 5521 patients (4052 men; 5126 white, 137 Hispanic, 82 African American, 40 Asian, 136 heritage not identified), women were younger (60.0 vs 62.1 years) and had shorter BE segments (3.2 vs 4.4 cm) and less dysplasia (37% vs 57%) than did men. Women were almost twice as likely to stricture (odds ratio 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.3). Although white patients were predominantly male, about half of African Americans and Asians with BE were female. African Americans and Asians had less dysplasia than white patients. Asians and African Americans had more strictures than did white patients. There were no sex or race differences in efficacy. LIMITATIONS Observational study with non-mandated paradigms, no central laboratory for reinterpretation of pathology. CONCLUSION In the U.S. RFA patient registry, women had shorter BE segments and less-aggressive histology. The usual tendency toward BE in men was absent in African Americans and Asians. Posttreatment stricture was more common among women and Asians. RFA efficacy did not differ by sex or race.\n",

Health disparities, health inequities and issues with systemic health access are some of the pre-existing issues African American were subjected to within the southern states in the United States. Second, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, social distancing was not practical and presented a challenge within the African American community, specifically, in the southern states. Objective This article assesses the effect of COVID-19 on African American in the southern states. Methodology This short communication queried the publicly available Department of Health statistics on COVID-19 related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states (Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA] and Mississippi [MS]) with a high proportion of African American residents. Second, unacast COVID-19 toolkit was used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance travelled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline). Results Across the four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in the African American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of the population cumulatively. This article finds that all four southern states received a social distancing grade of F. COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise. Conclusion Recognizing that there is a great need for African American representation or diversity in the health workforce would be able to better address the health disparities. In addition, the lack of diversity in the healthcare system causes the morbidity and mortality rates to increase in the African American communities because it is not able to address its primary obligations within the African American communities in the southern states during COVID-19 pandemic. These primary obligations are to restore, protect, improve health and to suppress health disparities and inequalities of COVID-19 within in the African American communities.

Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in African American and Hispanics. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as it relates to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation. METHODS: COVID-19 data was obtained from the official New York (NY) authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age adjusted COVID-19 related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. This data was cross compared to historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC. RESULTS: The two NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are The Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both The Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates 32% and 27% respectively. The two ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanics and African Americans) were also found to have the highest age adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared to the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8% respectively). CONCLUSION: Hispanics and African Americans in NYC seem to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of the higher incidence of mortality rates. Obesity may have played a role in the high incidence of mortality in those ethnic groups.\n",
