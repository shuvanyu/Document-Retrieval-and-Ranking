The radioactivity from 3H-methyl methionine was rapidly incorporated into the surface lipids of Mycobacterium avium. The transmethylation reaction was efficiently inhibited by DL-ethionine, D-norleucine and DL-norleucine. The structure of the outerlayer of the M. avium envelope was profoundly altered in the bacteria treated with DL-norleucine.
