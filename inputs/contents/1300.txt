OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to examine milk allergic patients to determine concomitant reactivity between milk, beef, pork and cat and dog dander and other common inhalant allergens. METHODS: 19 patients were selected according to their Immuno-CAP results, which had increased Ig-E levels against milk, pork or beef. Patients were also tested against Johnson grass, short ragweed, cat/dog dander and d. farina. RESULTS: Pearson's test revealed strong correlation between beef and pork, beef and milk, pork and milk Ig-E counts (consecutively r2 = 0.89, r2 = 0.81, r2 = 0.60 and p < 0.01. All cat allergic patients also appeared to be allergic to either beef/pork meat or milk. The correlation between pork and dog dander Ig-E counts was also significant (r2 = 0.38, p < 0.01). No correlation detected between milk-meat-pet and grass-weed-dust allergies. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patients who are known to have pet allergies may need to be screened for meat and milk allergy. Milk allergic patients may also need to avoid cows and pork meat.
