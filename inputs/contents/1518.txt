Microbiology of meats has been a subject of great concern in food science and public health in recent years. Although many articles have been devoted to the microbiology of beef, pork, and poultry meats, much less has been written about microbiology of lamb meat and even less on restructured lamb meat. This article presents data on microbiology and shelf-life of fresh lamb meat; restructured meat products, restructured lamb meat products, bacteriology of restructured meat products, and important foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes in meats and lamb meats. Also, the potential use of sodium and potassium lactates to control foodborne pathogens in meats and restructured lamb meat is reviewed This article should be of interest to all meat scientists, food scientists, and public health microbiologists who are concerned with the safety of meats in general and lamb meat in particular.
