Recent research indicates similarities between obesity and addictive disorders on both the phenomenological and neurobiological level. In particular, neuroendocrine and imaging studies suggest a close link between the homeostatic regulation of appetite on the on hand, and motivation and reward expectancy on the other. In addition, findings from neuropsychological studies additionally demonstrate alterations of cognitive function in both obesity and addictive disorders that possibly contribute to a lack of control in resisting consumption. In this review, recent findings on overlapping neurobiological and phenomenological pathways are summarized and the impact with regard to new treatment approaches for obesity is discussed. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction Biology © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.
