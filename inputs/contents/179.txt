Diverticular disease of the colon is a new disease that appeared at the beginning of this century. It is now the commonest disease of the colon in the Western world, being found in 1 in 3 people of over 60 years of age. The pathogenesis of the disease involves excessive segmentation, but this does not explain its aetiology. The historical appearance of the disease on the clinical scene and its geographical distribution suggest that it is due to the removal of fibre from carbohydrates. The author treated 70 patients with symptomatic diverticular disease with a high-fibre diet. The results of this and the effects of bran are discussed.
