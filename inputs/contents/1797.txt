Urine morphine levels after the consumption of poppy seeds were measured in two separate trials. Maximum levels of approximately 18 micrograms/ml were found using RIA, EMIT-ST and GC methodologies. Positive immunoassay results were seen up to 60 h post-ingestion. Several different lots of seeds from various sources were assayed for morphine and found to range from 4-200 mg/kg. Differentiation of poppy seed eaters from opiate users was not possible via the identification of minor alkaloid constituents of poppy seeds. It is, however, possible to analyse opiate urines with respect to 6-O-acetylmorphine. Below the level of approximately 5 micrograms/ml total opiates, GC/MS is the method of choice for this analysis.
