Infection with pork tapeworm, or Taenia solium, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. The most important and potentially devastating form of the infestation, neurocysticercosis, occurs when the parasite invades the central nervous system. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases in the United States due to immigration from endemic areas. This case study of a pregnant woman in the 35th week of gestation exemplifies the serious consequences of this infection in pregnancy, and discusses an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, treatment and eradication of this preventable disease.
