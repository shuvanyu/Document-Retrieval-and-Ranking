An occupational health survey conducted in a workshop in which asbestos cement was used showed initial atmospheric asbestos levels ranging from 1.9 to 27.5 fibres per millilitre of air. Radiological changes suggestive of asbestos-related pleural disease were found in 2 workers (2.5%), while 3 (3.8%) had borderline features of asbestosis. The survey confirmed that uncontrolled and hazardous use of asbestos continues in industry despite public awareness of its dangers and the Asbestos Regulations of 1987.
