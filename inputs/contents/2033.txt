Postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders (PI-FGID) have become a category in the general FGID classification. Bacterial PI-FGID has been well documented in several studies and meta-analysis. Increased risk does not appear to be confined to bacterial gastroenteritis (GE), also protozoan and helminth infections are sometimes followed by PI-FGID. In this issue of the journal, Zanini et al. provides evidence that Norovirus GE also leads to the development of PI-irritable bowel syndrome in a substantial proportion of patients.
