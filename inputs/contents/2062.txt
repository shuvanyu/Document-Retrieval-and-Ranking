Numerous studies have revealed that kiwifruit contains many medicinally useful compounds, among which antioxidants and serotonin may be beneficial in the treatment of the sleep disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of kiwifruit on sleep patterns, including sleep onset, duration, and quality. In this study, we applied a free-living, self-controlled diet design. Twenty-four subjects (2 males, 22 females) 20 to 55 years of age consumed 2 kiwifruits 1 hour before bedtime nightly for 4 weeks. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI), a 3-day sleep diary, and the Actigraph sleep/activity logger watch were used to assess the subjective and objective parameters of sleep quality, including time to bed, time of sleep onset, waking time after sleep onset, time of getting up, total sleep time, and self-reported sleep quality and sleep onset latency, waking time after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency before and after the intervention. After 4 weeks of kiwifruit consumption, the subjective CPSQI score, waking time after sleep onset, and sleep onset latency were significantly decreased (42.4%, 28.9%, and 35.4%, respectively). Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were significantly increased (13.4% and 5.41%, respectively). Kiwifruit consumption may improve sleep onset, duration, and efficiency in adults with self-reported sleep disturbances. Further investigation of the sleep-promoting properties of kiwifruit may be warranted.
