BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) and chronic periodontitis (CP) share common risk factors. There is only one report on the association between ED and CP. Thus, the aim of this study is to find the association between vasculogenic ED and CP. METHODS: A total of 70 patients (mean age: 35.3 Â± 3.64 years) clinically diagnosed with ED were included in the study. They were given the Sexual Health Inventory for Men Questionnaire and subjected to colored penile Doppler ultrasound. Periodontal parameters of probing depth and periodontal attachment level were recorded. Five patients with ED and CP were selected randomly for cardiac color Doppler to assess the integrity. RESULTS: Among the selected vasculogenic patients with ED, mild-to-moderate vasculogenic ED showed the highest prevalence, whereas prevalence for CP among all vasculogenic patients with ED was highest among severe ED (81.8%). Association of CP and vasculogenic ED was found to be correlated positively, but it showed no statistical significance. Two of five patients were found to have vascular insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: It can be hypothesized that an association exists between vasculogenic ED and CP in young males. However, a large-scale study with confounder analysis and a longitudinal follow-up is warranted.
