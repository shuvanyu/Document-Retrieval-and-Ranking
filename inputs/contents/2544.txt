Fenugreek, maple syrup and the urine of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients all share a characteristic odour originating from a common component, sotolone. Ingestion of fenugreek by mothers during labour resulted in a maple syrup-like odour in their newborn infants, leading to a false suspicion of MSUD.
