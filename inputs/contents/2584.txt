In this review recent publications are cited for a number of antimutagens. The molecules surveyed are potential or proven "desmutagens" or "interceptors." These are biologically prevalent or synthetic molecules that are most often small metabolites proficient in binding to, or reacting with, mutagenic chemicals and free radicals. Many of this class of "blocking agents" are "soft" and "hard" nucleophiles with consequently varying abilities to react with particular classes of electrophiles, the major classes of direct-acting mutagens. Although they serve as a first line of defense against mutagens and carcinogens, many interceptor molecules are under-investigated with regard to their spectra of activity and their possible relevance to prophylaxis or treatment of human disease states.
