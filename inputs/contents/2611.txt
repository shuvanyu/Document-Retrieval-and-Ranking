We studied the obstruction-relieving capabilities of transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TVP) in 32 symptomatic patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Urodynamic studies with pressure-flow analysis were performed before and 6 months after treatment. All 32 patients showed significant improvement of both subjective and objective obstruction parameters. There were few postoperative irritative symptoms and one patient required recatheterization. In conclusion, TVP is a promising modification of performing transurethral resection of the prostate, and it is indeed capable of relieving bladder outflow obstruction.
