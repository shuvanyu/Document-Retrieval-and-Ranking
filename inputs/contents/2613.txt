OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic cancer (CaP) in the mainland of China. METHODS: The incidence of BPH and CaP in urological hospital was investigated in 1997 in 26 provinces and 4 metropolises scattered over the mainland of China. The change of hospital incidences of BPH and CaP in the Institute of Urology, Beijing Medical University from 1951 to 1997 was also reviewed. RESULTS: The incidence of BPH and CaP in 1997 in 187 hospitals scattered over the mainland of China was 16.1% (15,459/95,749) and 1.5% (1389/95,749), respectively. The incidence of BPH and CaP in the Institute of Urology, Beijing University from 1951 to 1960 was 7.6% and 0.6%, respectively, while it was 18.5% and 3.4% from 1991 to 1997. CONCLUSION: The hospital incidence of BPH and CaP is rising rapidly in China, but CaP is still not a common disease in China.
