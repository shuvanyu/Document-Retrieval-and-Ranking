BACKGROUND: In April 2009, experts on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were convened to review updates on STD prevention and treatment in preparation for the revision of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STD Treatment Guidelines. At this meeting, there was a discussion of important updates on human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts, and cervical cancer screening. METHODS: Key questions were identified with assistance from an expert panel, and systematic reviews of the literature were conducted searching the English-language literature of the PubMed computerized database (US National Library of Medicine). The available evidence was reviewed, and new information was incorporated in the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines. RESULTS: Two HPV vaccines are now available, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and the bivalent HPV vaccine; either vaccine is recommended routinely for girls aged 11 or 12 years. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine may be given to boys and men aged 9-26 years. A new patient-applied treatment option for genital warts, sinecatechins 15% ointment, is available and recommended for treatment of external genital warts. This product is a mixture of active ingredients (catechins) from green tea. Finally, updated counseling guidelines and messages about HPV, genital warts, and cervical cancer are included. CONCLUSIONS: This manuscript highlights updates to the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines for HPV and genital warts. Important additions to the 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines include information on prophylactic HPV vaccine recommendations, new patient-applied treatment options for genital warts, and counseling messages for patients on HPV, genital warts, cervical cancer screening, and HPV tests.
