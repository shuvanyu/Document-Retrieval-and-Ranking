In human pregnancies, maternal absorption of iron is markedly curtailed in the first trimester. In a murine model, iron was teratogenic in the analogous embryonic period. Although iron is a weak mutagen, it is a powerful oxidant and a catalyst of formation of hydroxyl radicals. Studies are needed to determine if there might be an association of first trimester iron supplementation with miscarriage/fetal abnormalities.
