Attempt was made to analyse the gallstone for typing depending upon the composition. AIMS & OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to see the prevalence of different types of gallstone in Nepal and to correlate them with the clinical findings. MATERIALS & METHODS: Gallstones of 80 different patients who underwent cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis were collected from 20th January 2005 to 16th May 2006 in Department of Pathology, Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital.

RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The most commonly involved age group for cholelithiasis (32.5%) is found to be 30-39 years with a female predominance (M: F=1:3.2). Cholelithiasis was found more commonly among non-vegetarian with the vegetarian: non-vegetarian ratio 1:9.
