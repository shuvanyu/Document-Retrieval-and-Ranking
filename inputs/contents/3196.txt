Laboratory and population-based studies suggest that exposure to environmental toxicants may be one of several triggers for the development of endometriosis. We discuss evidence that modulation of the endometrial endocrine-immune interface could mechanistically link toxicant exposure to the development of this disease. Capsule Summary: Environmental toxicant exposure induces an inflammatory-like endometrial response that may promote the development of endometriosis.
