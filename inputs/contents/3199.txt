The co-occurrence of fish MeHg and omega-3 fatty acids in wild species can indeed be optimized by choosing certain species. Farmed finfish and shellfish that are fed fish-meal, however, can bioconcentrate both MeHg (in muscle) and organohalogen pollutants passed on in the fat components [Dorea, J.G., 2006. Fish meal in animal feed and human exposure to persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances. J. Food Prot. 69, 2777-2785); when fish-meal is used to feed farm animals it may offer the worst of both worlds: saturated fat (with organohalogen pollutants) and MeHg. It is time to address the dietary sources of Hg derived from animals raised on fish-meal that may contribute to increase tissue Hg concentrations.
