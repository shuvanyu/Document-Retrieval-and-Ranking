We examined the association of dietary lignan intake with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and ER positive (ER+) breast cancer risk in a breast cancer case-control study. Among premenopausal women only, there was a reduced risk of ER- breast cancer for those in the highest compared to the lowest quartile of lignan intake suggesting that the observed negative association of lignans with breast cancer may be limited to ER- tumors.
