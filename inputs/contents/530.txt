Considerable evidence suggests that the carcinogens or co-carcinogens responsible for the development of colorectal cancer are either bacterially degraded bile acids or cholesterol. It is proposed that a high colonic pH promotes co-carcinogen formation from these substances and that acidification of the colon either by dietary fibre (following its bacterial digestion to short-chain fatty acids) or milk (in lactose-intolerant individuals) may prevent this process.
