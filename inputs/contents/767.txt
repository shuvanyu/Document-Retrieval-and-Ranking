Beneficial effects of consumption of fruit and vegetables on the cardiovascular system have been reported. Fruit and vegetable components affect the cardiovascular system in both antioxidant and nonantioxidant ways. The mechanisms of their actions are, however, still not well understood. The compounds present in fruits and vegetables may function individually or in concert to protect lipoproteins and vascular cells from oxidation or by other mechanisms such as reducing plasma lipid levels, high blood pressure, and platelet hyperactivity. Emerging data indicate that kiwifruit is beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, as consumption of two or three fruit per day for 28 days or more lowers platelet hyperactivity, plasma lipids, and blood pressure in human volunteers. These studies suggest that kiwifruit may provide a new dietary means as part of a preventive or therapeutic strategy to favorably modify cardiovascular risk factors. The relevance of lowering the cardiovascular risk factors by kiwifruit in human health is discussed. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
