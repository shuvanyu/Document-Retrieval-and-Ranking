Semen analysis of 66 unmarried medical students in the age group of 17-21 years was carried out. A higher liquefaction time pH, motility, lower sperm count and abnormal forms were observed compared to reported values. Liquefaction time, pH and sperm count was found significantly different in non-vegetarians and vegetarians, perhaps due to difference in their dietary proteins.
