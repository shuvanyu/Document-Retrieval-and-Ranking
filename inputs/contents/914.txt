As a hard tissue dental disease, dental erosion has a multifactorial etiology. The majority of dental erosion that originates from extrinsic sources is the result of dietary intake, particularly acidic beverages. Several preventive means have been proposed to minimize the damage to the dentition, including a reduction in the consumption of causative beverages and the adoption of a specific method of drinking, utilizing a straw instead of a cup. This article presents two cases involving the clinical and radiographic features of erosion lesions associated with chronic and excessive intake of acidic carbonated beverages. These examples embody how drinking patterns influence the formation of erosion lesions in various anatomic locations within the dentition. The clinical and radiographic evidence presented in this report cautions against the use of nonspecific terms, such as "cup versus straw," and instead suggests implementing a more precise description of the suggested method. In view of the extensive damage inflicted by the chronic, excessive intake of carbonated beverages, preventive measures are considered to be the only effective course of management. This article offers illustrative examples of erosion lesions associated with long-term excessive intake of carbonated beverages. The influence of the drinking method--that is, a straw positioned into the labial vestibule versus a cup--on the anatomic location of the erosion lesions will be demonstrated through clinical and radiographic evidence.
