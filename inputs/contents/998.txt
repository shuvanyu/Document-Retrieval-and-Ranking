PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent literature on important topics in pediatric office practice: bullying, screening for the prediabetic state, and pediatric oral health. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature shows that bullying behaviors are common in children as young as kindergarten age, that there is a strong association between being a bully or victim and a range of psychosomatic and depressive symptoms in children, and that interventions including family therapy and school-based programs are effective for bullies and victims. Recent studies have further delineated glucose and insulin metabolism. Recent work has provided new models to help practitioners screen for the prediabetic state in hope of providing earlier opportunities to intervene and avoid the morbidities associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent literature emphasizes continued gaps in dental healthcare for patients who are most at risk. Recent studies emphasize the important role that diet and sealants have in preventing dental caries. SUMMARY: Recent literature emphasizes the important role that office-based pediatricians have in identifying patients who are involved in bullying, at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, or have poor dental health. Future research will help delineate these problems and provide us with refined primary prevention and treatment guidelines.
