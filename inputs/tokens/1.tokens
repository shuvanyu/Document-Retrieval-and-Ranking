recent studies have suggested that statins an established drug group in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality could delay or prevent breast cancer recurrence but the effect on diseasespecific mortality remains unclearwe evaluated risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a populationbased cohort of breast cancer patientsthe study cohort included all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in finland during 19952003 31236 cases identified from the finnish cancer registryinformation on statin use before and after the diagnosis was obtained from a national prescription databasewe used the cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users with statin use as timedependent variablea total of 4151 participants had used statinsduring the median followup of 325 years after the diagnosis range 00890 years 6011 participants died of which 3619 602 was due to breast cancerafter adjustment for age tumor characteristics and treatment selection both postdiagnostic and prediagnostic statin use were associated with lowered risk of breast cancer death hr 046 95 ci 038055 and hr 054 95 ci 044067 respectivelythe risk decrease by postdiagnostic statin use was likely affected by healthy adherer bias that is the greater likelihood of dying cancer patients to discontinue statin use as the association was not clearly dosedependent and observed already at lowdoseshortterm usethe dose and timedependence of the survival benefit among prediagnostic statin users suggests a possible causal effect that should be evaluated further in a clinical trial testing statins effect on survival in breast cancer patients
