microgreens seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs have gained popularity as a new culinary trend over the past few yearsalthough small in size microgreens can provide surprisingly intense flavors vivid colors and crisp textures and can be served as an edible garnish or a new salad ingredienthowever no scientific data are currently available on the nutritional content of microgreensthe present study was conducted to determine the concentrations of ascorbic acid carotenoids phylloquinone and tocopherols in 25 commercially available microgreensresults showed that different microgreens provided extremely varying amounts of vitamins and carotenoidstotal ascorbic acid contents ranged from 204 to 1470 mg per 100 g fresh weight fw while βcarotene luteinzeaxanthin and violaxanthin concentrations ranged from 06 to 121 13 to 101 and 09 to 77 mg100 g fw respectivelyphylloquinone level varied from 06 to 41 μgg fw meanwhile αtocopherol and γtocopherol ranged from 49 to 874 and 30 to 394 mg100 g fw respectivelyamong the 25 microgreens assayed red cabbage cilantro garnet amaranth and green daikon radish had the highest concentrations of ascorbic acids carotenoids phylloquinone and tocopherols respectivelyin comparison with nutritional concentrations in mature leaves usda national nutrient database the microgreen cotyledon leaves possessed higher nutritional densitiesthe phytonutrient data may provide a scientific basis for evaluating nutritional values of microgreens and contribute to food composition databasethese data also may be used as a reference for health agencies recommendations and consumers choices of fresh vegetables
