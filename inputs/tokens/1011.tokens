background type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the united statessome risk factors  elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load overweight and a sedentary lifestyle  are potentially reversiblewe hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyleintervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetesmethods we randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and postload plasma glucose concentrations to placebo metformin 850 mg twice daily or a lifestylemodification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per weekthe mean age of the participants was 51 years and the mean bodymass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 340 68 percent were women and 45 percent were members of minority groupsresults the average followup was 28 yearsthe incidence of diabetes was 110 78 and 48 cases per 100 personyears in the placebo metformin and lifestyle groups respectivelythe lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent 95 percent confidence interval 48 to 66 percent and metformin by 31 percent 95 percent confidence interval 17 to 43 percent as compared with placebo the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metforminto prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years 69 persons would have to participate in the lifestyleintervention program and 139 would have to receive metforminconclusions lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high riskthe lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin
