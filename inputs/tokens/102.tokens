cutaneous synthesis of vitamin d by exposure to uvb is the principal source of vitamin d in the human bodyour current clothing habits and reduced time spent outdoors put us at risk of many insufficiencyrelated diseases that are associated with calcaemic and noncalcaemic functions of vitamin d populations with traditional lifestyles having lifelong yearround exposure to tropical sunlight might provide us with information on optimal vitamin d status from an evolutionary perspectivewe measured the sum of serum 25hydroxyvitamin d₂ and d₃ 25ohd concentrations of thirtyfive pastoral maasai 34 sd 10 years 43  male and twentyfive hadzabe huntergatherers 35 sd 12 years 84  male living in tanzaniathey have skin type vi have a moderate degree of clothing spend the major part of the day outdoors but avoid direct exposure to sunlight when possibletheir 25ohd concentrations were measured by liquid chromatographymsmsthe mean serum 25ohd concentrations of maasai and hadzabe were 119 range 58167 and 109 range 71171 nmoll respectivelythese concentrations were not related to age sex or bmipeople with traditional lifestyles living in the cradle of mankind have a mean circulating 25ohd concentration of 115 nmollwhether this concentration is optimal under the conditions of the current western lifestyle is uncertain and should as a possible target be investigated with concomitant appreciation of other important factors in ca homeostasis that we have changed since the agricultural revolution
