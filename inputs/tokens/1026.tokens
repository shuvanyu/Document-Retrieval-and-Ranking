aim to investigate all patients referred to our center with nonresponsive celiac disease nrcd to establish a cause for their continued symptomsmethods we assessed all patients referred to our center with nonresponsive celiac disease over an 18mo periodthese individuals were investigated to establish the eitiology of their continued symptomsthe patients were first seen in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine blood work including tissue transglutaminase antibody measurementthey were also referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to identift any lapses in the diet and sources of hidden gluten ingestiona repeat small intestinal biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital where possiblecolonoscopy lactulose hydrogen breath testing pancreolauryl testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the symptoms persistedtheir clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2 yearsresults one hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with nrcdtwelve were found not to have celiac disease cdof the remaining 100 patients 45 were not adequately adhering to a strict glutenfree diet with 24 53 found to be inadvertently ingesting gluten and 21 47 admitting noncompliancemicroscopic colitis was diagnosed in 12 and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in 9refractory cd was diagnosed in 9three of these were diagnosed with intestinal lymphomaafter 2 years 78 patients remained well eight had continuing symptoms and four had diedconclusion in individuals with nrcd a remediable cause can be found in 90 with continued gluten ingestion as the leading causewe propose an algorithm for investigation
