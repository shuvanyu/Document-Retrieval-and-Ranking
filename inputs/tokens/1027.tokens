epidemiological studies find that wholegrain intake is protective against cancer cvd diabetes and obesitydespite recommendations to consume three servings of whole grains daily usual intake in western countries is only about one servingdwhole grains are rich in nutrients and phytochemicals with known health benefitswhole grains have high concentrations of dietary fibre resistant starch and oligosaccharideswhole grains are rich in antioxidants including trace minerals and phenolic compounds and these compounds have been linked to disease preventionother protective compounds in whole grains include phytate phytooestrogens such as lignan plant stanols and sterols and vitamins and mineralspublished wholegrain feeding studies report improvements in biomarkers with wholegrain consumption such as weight loss bloodlipid improvement and antioxidant protectionalthough it is difficult to separate the protective properties of whole grains from dietary fibre and other components the disease protection seen from whole grains in prospective epidemiological studies far exceeds the protection from isolated nutrients and phytochemicals in whole grains
