natural killer nk cell activity and concentration of cd16 cells nk cells and cd20 cells monocytes in peripheral blood were measured in highly trained racing cyclists and in age and sexmatched untrained controlsmedian nk cell activity was 381 range 200571 in trained vs 303 range 197431 in untrained p  0008median cd16 cells was 17 range 733 in trained vs 11 329 in untrained p  0007indomethacin in vitro enhanced the nk cell activity in both groupsthere was however no significant difference between the nk cell activity in trained and untrained after exposure to indomethacin in vitroindomethacinenhanced nk cell activity was 459 range 244675 in trained and 400 range 239685 in untrained p  0138mean cd14 cells was 83 range 215 in trained vs 38 28 in untrained p less than 00001the increased nk cell function thus demonstrated in highly trained persons might result in better resistance against infectious disease
