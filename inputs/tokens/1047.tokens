cancer incidence increases with advancing ageover 60 of new cancers and 70 of cancer deaths occur in individuals aged 65 years or olderone factor that may contribute to this is immunosenescence  a canopy term that is used to describe agerelated declines in the normal functioning of the immune systemthere are multiple agerelated deficits in both the innate and adaptive systems that may play a role in the increased incidence of cancerthese include decreased nkcell function impaired antigen uptake and presentation by monocytes and dendritic cells an increase in inflammaging a decline in the number of na√Øve tcells able to respond to evolving tumor cells and an increase in functionally exhausted senescent cellsthere is consensus that habitual physical exercise can offer protection against certain types of cancer however the evidence linking immunological mechanisms exercise and reduced cancer risk remain tentativemultiple studies published over the last two decades suggest that exercise can mitigate the deleterious effects of age on immune function thus increasing anticancer immunitythe potential ameliorative effect of exercise on these mechanisms include evidence that physical activity is able to stimulate greater nkcell activity enhance antigenpresentation reduce inflammation and prevent senescent cell accumulation in the elderlyhere we discuss the role played by the immune system in preventing and controlling cancer and how aging may retard these anticancer mechanismswe also propose a pathway by which exerciseinduced alterations in immunosenescence may decrease the incidence of cancer and help improve prognosis in cancer patientscopyright  2013 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
