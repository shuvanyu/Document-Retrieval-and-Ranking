aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of chlorella in 18 patients chronically infected with hepatitis c virus hcv genotype 1methods eighteen adults with chronic infection by hcv genotype 1 received daily oral supplementation of chlorella for 12 wkchanges in the rna levels of hcv as well as those of aspartate aminotransferase ast and alanine aminotransferase alt levels were evaluated following this treatment periodpaired t tests were conducted to compare the means of the different variables at the beginning and end of the studyside effects and quality of life aspects were also compared between weeks 0 and 12 of the study periodresults a majority 8461 of the patients had a significant decrease in their alt levels from week 0 to week 12evaluation of side effects showed that chlorella was well toleratedquality of life assessment showed that 769 of the participants reported an improvement in their energy levels and 461 reported an improvement in their perception of general healthalthough 6923 also showed a decrease in their ast levels this was not statistically significantmost patients that exhibited an improvement in their alt and ast levels also showed a tendency toward a decreased hcv viral loadthe hcv rna levels showed a decrease in 6923 of the patients which along with changes in astalt ratios from week 0 to week 12 these results were not statistically significantconclusion chlorella supplementation was well tolerated in patients with chronic hcv and associated with a significant decrease in alt liver enzyme levels
