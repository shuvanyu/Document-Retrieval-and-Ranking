the relationship between cardiorespiratory exercise immune function and upper respiratory tract infection urti was studied in elderly women utilizing a randomized controlled experimental design with a followup of 12 wkthirtytwo sedentary elderly caucasian women 6785 yr of age who met specific selection criteria were randomized to either a walking or calisthenic group 30 completed the studytwelve highly conditioned elderly women 6584 yr of age who were active in endurance competitions were recruited at baseline for crosssectional comparisonsintervention groups exercised 3040 min 5 dwk1 for 12 wk with the walking group training at 60 heart rate reserve and the calisthenic group engaging in mild rangeofmotion and flexibility movements that kept their heart rates close to resting levelsat baseline the highly conditioned subjects exhibited superior nk 119  13 vs 77  8 lytic units p  001 and t 333  49 vs 214  21 cpm x 103 using pha p  005 cell function despite no differences in circulating levels of lymphocyte subpopulationstwelve weeks of moderate cardiorespiratory exercise improved the vo2max of the sedentary subjects 126 but did not result in any improvement in nk cell activity or t cell functionincidence of urti was lowest in the highly conditioned group and highest in the calisthenic control group during the 12wk study with the walkers in an intermediate position chisquare  636 p  0042in conclusion the highly conditioned elderly women in this study had superior nk and t cell function when compared with their sedentary counterpartsabstract truncated at 250 words
