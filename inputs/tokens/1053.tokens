a randomly controlled 15wk exercise training et study five 45min sessionswk brisk walking at 60 heart rate reserve with a group of 36 mildly obese sedentary women was conducted to investigate the relationship between improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness changes in natural killer nk cell number and activity and acute upper respiratory tract infection uri symptomatologythe study was conducted using a 2 exercise and nonexercise groups x 3 baseline 6 and 15wk testing sessions factorial design with data analyzed using repeated measures anovano significant change in nk cell number occurred as a result of et as measured by the cd16 and leu19 monoclonal antibodieset did have a significant effect on nk cell activity et 501 especially during the initial 6wk period f268  1234 p less than 0001using data from daily logs kept by each subject the exercise group was found to have significantly fewer uri symptom daysincident than the nonexercise group 36  07 vs 70  14 days respectively p  0049improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness was correlated significantly with a reduction in uri symptom daysincident r  037 p  0025 and a change in nk cell activity from baseline to six but not 15 wks r  035 p  0036in summary moderate et is associated with elevated nk cell activity after six but not 15 weeks and reduced uri symptomatology in comparison to a randomized sedentary control group
