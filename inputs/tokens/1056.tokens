objectives it has been reported that a number of children with constipation respond to a diet free of cowsmilk cm proteins although evidence is lacking to support an immunoglobulin emediated mechanismpatients and methods we performed an openlabel crossover study comparing cm and rice milk in 69 children who fulfilled rome iii criteria for chronic constipationclinical physical and immunologic parameters of patients who responded r and who did not respond nr to a cmfree diet were comparedresults thirtyfive of the 69 children 51 improved during the first cmfree diet phase 8 of these did not develop constipation when cm was reintroduced and 27 children 39 developed constipation during the cm challenge and improved during the second cmfree diet phase r groupthirtyfour children 49 did not improve during the first cmfree diet phase nr groupbowel movements per week among r children significantly increased compared with nr children r 2877 vs nr 2627 p  0001seventyeight percent of the children with developmental delay responded to the cmfree diet p  0007no significant statistical difference was found between the r and nr children in terms of fiber and milk consumption atopic or allergic history fullblood eosinophil count and percentage and lymphocyte populations immunoglobulins immunoglobulin igg subclasses total ige and serumspecific immunoglobulin e for cm proteinsconclusions a clear association between cm consumption and constipation has been found in more than one third of childrenhowever analytical parameters do not demonstrate an immunoglobulin emediated immunologic mechanism
