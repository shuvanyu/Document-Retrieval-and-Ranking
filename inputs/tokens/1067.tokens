epidemiological evidence shows that regular consumption of brassicaceae is associated with a reduced risk of cancer and heart diseasecruciferous species are usually processed before eating and the real impact of cooking practices on their bioactive properties is not fully understoodwe have evaluated the effect of common cooking practices boiling microwaving and steaming on the biological activities of broccoli cauliflower and brussels sproutsantiproliferative and chemoprotective effects towards dna oxidative damage of fresh and cooked vegetable extracts were evaluated by 345dimethylthiazol2yl53carboxymethoxyphenyl24sulfophenyl2htetrazolium and comet assays on ht29 human colon carcinoma cellsthe fresh vegetable extracts showed the highest antiproliferative and antioxidant activities on ht29 cells broccolicauliflower  brussels sproutsno genotoxic activity was detected in any of the samples testedthe cooking methods that were applied influenced the antiproliferative activity of brassica extracts but did not alter considerably the antioxidant activity presented by the raw vegetablesraw microwaved boiled except broccoli and steamed vegetable extracts at different concentrations presented a protective antioxidative action comparable with vitamin c 1 mmthese data provide new insight into the influence of domestic treatment on the quality of food which could support the recent epidemiological studies suggesting that consumption of cruciferous vegetables mainly cooked may be related to a reduced risk of developing cancer
