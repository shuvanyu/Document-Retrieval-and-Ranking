sulforaphane 1isothiocyanate4rmethylsulfinylbutane is a natural dietary isothiocyanate produced by the enzymatic action of the myrosinase on glucopharanin a 4methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables of the genus brassica such as broccoli brussel sprouts and cabbagestudies on this compound is increasing because its anticarcinogenic and cytoprotective properties in several in vivo experimental paradigms associated with oxidative stress such as focal cerebral ischemia brain inflammation intracerebral hemorrhage ischemia and reperfusion induced acute renal failure cisplatin inducednephrotoxicity streptozotocininduced diabetes carbon tetrachlorideinduced hepatotoxicity and cardiac ischemia and reperfusionthis protective effect also has been observed in in vitro studies in different cell lines such as human neuroblastoma shsy5y renal epithelial proximal tubule llcpk1 cells and aortic smooth muscle a10 cellssulforaphane is considered an indirect antioxidant this compound is able to induce many cytoprotective proteins including antioxidant enzymes through the nrf2antioxidant response element pathwayheme oxygenase1 nadph quinone oxidoreductase glutathionestransferase gammaglutamyl cysteine ligase and glutathione reductase are among the cytoprotective proteins induced by sulforaphanein conclusion sulforaphane is a promising antioxidant agent that is effective to attenuate oxidative stress and tissuecell damage in different in vivo and in vitro experimental paradigmscopyright  2010 elsevier gmbhall rights reserved
