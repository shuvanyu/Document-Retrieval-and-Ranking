glucosinolates glss are found in brassica vegetablesexamples of these sources include cabbage brussels sprouts broccoli cauliflower and various root vegetables egradish and turnipa number of epidemiological studies have identified an inverse association between consumption of these vegetables and the risk of colon and rectal canceranimal studies have shown changes in enzyme activities and dna damage resulting from consumption of brassica vegetables or isothiocyanates the breakdown products bdp of glss in the bodymechanistic studies have begun to identify the ways in which the compounds may exert their protective action but the relevance of these studies to protective effects in the human alimentary tract is as yet unprovenin vitro studies with a number of specific isothiocyanates have suggested mechanisms that might be the basis of their chemoprotective effectsthe concentration and composition of the glss in different plants but also within a plant egin the seeds roots or leaves can vary greatly and also changes during plant developmentfurthermore the effects of various factors in the supply chain of brassica vegetables including breeding cultivation storage and processing on intake and bioavailability of glss are extensively discussed in this paper
