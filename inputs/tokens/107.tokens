background and objectives momordica charantia locally known as ampalaya is being widely used and advertised for its hypoglycemic effectshowever to date no large clinical trial has been published on the efficacy of any type of preparationthe main objective of this study is to determine if addition of m charantia capsules to standard therapy can decrease glycosylated hemoglobin hemoglobin a1c or hba1c levels in diabetic patients with poor sugar controlstudy design and setting a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial was conducted between april and september 2004 at the outpatient clinics of the philippine general hospitalthe trial included 40 patients 18 years old and above who were either newly diagnosed or poorly controlled type 2 diabetics with a1c levels between 7 and 9on top of the standard therapy the patients were randomized to either m charantia capsules or placebothe treatment group received two capsules of m charantia three times a day after meals for 3 monthsthe control group received placebo at the same dosethe primary efficacy endpoint was change in the a1c level in the two groupsthe secondary efficacy endpoints included its effect on fasting blood sugar serum cholesterol and weightsafety endpoints included effects on serum creatinine hepatic transaminases alanine aminotransferasealt and aspartate aminotransferaseast sodium potassium and adverse eventsresults baseline characteristics between the treatment and control groups were similarthe difference in mean change in a1c between the two groups was 022 in favor of m charantia 95 ci 040 to 084 with p04825there was no significant effect on mean fasting blood sugar total cholesterol and weight or on serum creatinine alt ast sodium and potassiumthere were few adverse events and these were generally mildconclusion this is the first randomized controlled trial to shed light on the issue concerning the hypoglycemic effects of m charantiathe investigators targeted a 1 decline in a1c at the outset with an estimated power of 88with the observed decline of 024 the achieved power was only 11for this reason we are unable to make a definite conclusion about the effectiveness of m charantiahowever the results of this study can be used estimate the sample size for bigger studies
