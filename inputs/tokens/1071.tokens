scope sulforaphane a potent anticarcinogenic isothiocyanate derived from glucoraphanin is widely considered responsible for the protective effects of broccoli consumptionbroccoli is typically purchased fresh or frozen and cooked before consumptionwe compared the bioavailability and metabolism of sulforaphane from portions of lightly cooked fresh or frozen broccoli and investigated the bioconversion of sulforaphane to erucinmethods and results eighteen healthy volunteers consumed broccoli soups produced from fresh or frozen broccoli florets that had been lightly cooked and sulforaphane thioconjugates quantified in plasma and urinesulforaphane bioavailability was about tenfold higher for the soups made from fresh compared to frozen broccoli and the reduction was shown to be due to destruction of myrosinase activity by the commercial blanchingfreezing processsulforaphane appeared in plasma and urine in its free form and as several thioconjugates formserucin nacetylcysteine conjugate was a significant urinary metabolite and it was shown that human gut microflora can produce sulforaphane erucin and their nitriles from glucoraphaninconclusion the short period of blanching used to produce commercial frozen broccoli destroys myrosinase and substantially reduces sulforaphane bioavailabilitysulforaphane was converted to erucin and excreted in urine and it was shown that human colonic flora were capable of this conversion 2012 wileyvch verlag gmbh  co kgaa weinheim
