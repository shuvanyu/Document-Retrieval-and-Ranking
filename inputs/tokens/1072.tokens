purpose protecting the lens against oxidative stress is of great importance in delaying the onset of cataractisothiocyanates such as sulforaphane sfn are proposed to provide cytoprotection against oxidative stresswe therefore tested the ability of sfn to perform this role in lens cells and establish its ability to delay the onset of cataractmethods the human lens epithelial cell line fhl124 and whole porcine lens culture systems were usedthe apotoxglo triplex assay was used to assess fhl124 cell survival cytotoxicity and apoptosisthe mts assay was used to assess cell populationsto determine levels of dna strand breaks the alkaline comet assay was performed and quantifiedlactate dehydrogenase levels in the medium were evaluated to reflect cell damagedeathto assess level of gene expression an illumina wholegenome ht12 v4 beadchip was usedprotein expression was determined by western blot and immunocytochemistryresults exposures of 30 μm h2o2 to fhl124 cells caused a reduction in cell viability and increased cytotoxicityapoptosis these effects were significantly inhibited by 24hour pretreatment with 1 μm sfnin addition 1 μm sfn significantly reduced h2o2induced dna strand breakswhen applied to cultured porcine lenses sfn protected against h2o2induced opacificationillumina wholegenome ht12 v4 beadchip microarray data revealed eight genes upregulated following 24hour exposure to 1 and 2μm sfn which included nqo1 and txnrd1this pattern was confirmed at the protein levelnrf2 translocated to the nucleus in response to 05 to 20μm sfn exposure conclusions the dietary component sfn demonstrates an ability to protect human lens cells against oxidative stress and thus could potentially delay the onset of cataract
