induction of phase 2 detoxication enzymes eg glutathione transferases epoxide hydrolase nadph quinone reductase and glucuronosyltransferases is a powerful strategy for achieving protection against carcinogenesis mutagenesis and other forms of toxicity of electrophiles and reactive forms of oxygensince consumption of large quantities of fruit and vegetables is associated with a striking reduction in the risk of developing a variety of malignancies it is of interest that a number of edible plants contain substantial quantities of compounds that regulate mammalian enzymes of xenobiotic metabolismthus edible plants belonging to the family cruciferae and genus brassica eg broccoli and cauliflower contain substantial quantities of isothiocyanates mostly in the form of their glucosinolate precursors some of which eg sulforaphane or 4methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate are very potent inducers of phase 2 enzymesunexpectedly 3dayold sprouts of cultivars of certain crucifers including broccoli and cauliflower contain 10100 times higher levels of glucoraphanin the glucosinolate of sulforaphane than do the corresponding mature plantsglucosinolates and isothiocyanates can be efficiently extracted from plants without hydrolysis of glucosinolates by myrosinase by homogenization in a mixture of equal volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide dimethylformamide and acetonitrile at 50cextracts of 3dayold broccoli sprouts containing either glucoraphanin or sulforaphane as the principal enzyme inducer were highly effective in reducing the incidence multiplicity and rate of development of mammary tumors in dimethylbenzaanthracenetreated ratsnotably sprouts of many broccoli cultivars contain negligible quantities of indole glucosinolates which predominate in the mature vegetable and may give rise to degradation products eg indole3carbinol that can enhance tumorigenesishence small quantities of crucifer sprouts may protect against the risk of cancer as effectively as much larger quantities of mature vegetables of the same variety
