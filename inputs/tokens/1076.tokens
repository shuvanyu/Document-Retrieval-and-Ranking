frozen broccoli can provide a cheaper product with a longer shelf life and less preparation time than fresh broccoliwe previously showed that several commercially available frozen broccoli products do not retain the ability to generate the cancerpreventative agent sulforaphanewe hypothesized that this was because the necessary hydrolyzing enzyme myrosinase was destroyed during blanching as part of the processing that frozen broccoli undergoesthis study was carried out to determine a way to overcome loss of hydrolyzing activityindustrial blanching usually aims to inactivate peroxidase although lipoxygenase plays a greater role in product degradation during frozen storage of broccoliblanching at 86 c or higher inactivated peroxidase lipoxygenase and myrosinaseblanching at 76 c inactivated 92 of lipoxygenase activity whereas there was only an 18 loss in myrosinasedependent sulforaphane formationwe considered that thawing frozen broccoli might disrupt membrane integrity allowing myrosinase and glucoraphanin to come into contactthawing frozen broccoli for 9 h did not support sulforaphane formation unless an exogenous source of myrosinase was addedthermal stability studies showed that broccoli root as a source of myrosinase was not more heat stable than broccoli floretdaikon radish root supported some sulforaphane formation even when heated at 125 c for 10 min a time and temperature comparable to or greater than microwave cookingdaikon radish 025 added to frozen broccoli that was then allowed to thaw supported sulforaphane formation without any visual alteration to that of untreated broccoli 2013 institute of food technologists
