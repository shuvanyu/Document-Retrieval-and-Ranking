isothiocyanates are found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli brussels sprouts cauliflower and cabbageepidemiologic studies suggest that cruciferous vegetable intake may lower overall cancer risk including colon and prostate cancersulforaphane sfn is an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables and is especially high in broccoli and broccoli sproutssfn has proved to be an effective chemoprotective agent in cell culture carcinogeninduced and genetic animal cancer models as well as in xenograft models of cancerearly research focused on the blocking activity of sfn via phase 2 enzyme induction as well as inhibition of enzymes involved in carcinogen activation but there has been growing interest in other mechanisms of chemoprotection by sfnrecent studies suggest that sfn offers protection against tumor development during the postinitiation phase and mechanisms for suppression effects of sfn including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are of particular interestin humans a key factor in determining the efficacy of sfn as a chemoprevention agent is gaining an understanding of the metabolism distribution and bioavailability of sfn and the factors that alter these parametersthis review discusses the established anticancer properties of sfn with an emphasis on the possible chemoprevention mechanismsthe current status of sfn in human clinical trials also is included with consideration of the chemistry metabolism absorption and factors influencing sfn bioavailability
