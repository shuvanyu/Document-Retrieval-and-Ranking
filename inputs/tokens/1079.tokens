cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries and although many processes play a role in the development of vascular disease thrombosis is the primary event that precipitates stroke and acute coronary syndromesthe blood platelets are of significant importance in medicinethese cells are involved in many physiological processes particularly haemostasis through their ability to aggregate and form clots in response to activationin addition these dynamic cells display activities that extend beyond thrombosis including an important role in initiating and sustaining vascular inflammationthe expansion of knowledge from basic and clinical research has highlighted the critical position of platelets in several inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosisplatelets are emerging as important mediators of inflammation and provide important signals to mediate phenotype of other blood and vascular cellsthe important role of platelets in arterial thrombosis and the onset of acute myocardial infarction after atherosclerotic plaque rupture make inhibition of platelet aggregation a critical step in preventing thrombotic events associated with stroke heart attack and peripheral arterial thrombosishowever the use of platelet inhibitors for thrombosis prevention must seek a delicate balance between inhibiting platelet activation and an associated increased bleeding riskthe aim of this review is to update the knowledge on platelets physiology and dysfunction in pathologies such as diabetes mellitus hypercholesterolemia and hypertension emphasizing the link between platelets and the inflammationrelated atherosclerosisthe review evaluates the opportunities offered by the novel platelet inhibitors to efficiently alleviate the thrombotic eventscopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
