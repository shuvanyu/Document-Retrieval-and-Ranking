adrenocortical carcinomas are rare but present with extremely poor prognosisone of the approaches to control cancer progression and reduce cancer risk is prevention through dietbitter melon is widely consumed as a vegetable and especially as a traditional medicine in many countriesin this study we have used human and mouse adrenocortical cancer cells as an in vitro model to assess the efficacy of bitter melon extract bme as an anticancer agentthe protein concentrations of bme and other extracts were measured before usefirst bme treatment of adrenocortical cancer cells resulted in a significantly dosedependent decrease in cell proliferationhowever we did not observe an antiproliferative effect in adrenocortical cancer cells treated with extracts from blueberry zucchini and acorn squashsecond apoptosis of adrenocortical cancer cells was accompanied by increased caspase3 activation and polyadpribose polymerase cleavagebme treatment enhanced cellular tumor antigen p53 cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1a also called p21 and cyclic ampdependent transcription factor3 levels and inhibited g1sspecific cyclin d1 d2 and d3 and mitogenactivated protein kinase 8 also called janus kinase expression suggesting an additional mechanism involving cell cycle regulation and cell survivalthird bme treatment decreased the key proteins involved in steroidogenesis in adrenocortical cancer cellsbme treatment decreased the level of phosphorylation of cyclindependent kinase 7 which is required at least in part for steroidogenic factor 1 activationfinally we observed that bme treatment significantly reduced the level of insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor and its downstream signaling pathway as evidenced by lower levels of phosphorylated racÎ± serinethreonineprotein kinasetaken together these data illustrate the inhibitory effect of bitter melon on cell proliferation of adrenocortical cancer through modulation of diverse mechanisms
