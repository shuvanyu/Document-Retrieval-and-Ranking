strawberries are an important fruit in the mediterranean diet because of their high content of essential nutrients and beneficial phytochemicals which seem to exert beneficial effects in human healthhealthy volunteers were supplemented daily with 500 g of strawberries for 1 monthplasma lipid profile circulating and cellular markers of antioxidant status oxidative stress and platelet function were evaluated at baseline after 30 days of strawberry consumption and 15 days after the end of the studya high concentration of vitamin c and anthocyanins was found in the fruitsstrawberry consumption beneficially influenced the lipid profile by significantly reducing total cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides levels 878 1372 and 2080 respectively p05 compared with baseline period while highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol remained unchangedstrawberry supplementation also significant decreased serum malondialdehyde urinary 8ohdg and isoprostanes levels 3140 2967 2790 respectively p05all the parameters returned to baseline values after the washout perioda significant increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity measured by both ferric reducing ability of plasma and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays and vitamin c levels 2497 4118 4136 respectively p05 was observed after strawberry consumptionmoreover the spontaneous and oxidative hemolysis were significant reduced 317 and 3903 respectively p05 compared to the baseline point which remained stable after the washout periodfinally strawberry intake significant decrease p05 the number of activated platelets compared to both baseline and washout valuesstrawberries consumption improves plasma lipids profile biomarkers of antioxidant status antihemolytic defenses and platelet function in healthy subjects encouraging further evaluation on a population with higher cardiovascular disease riskcopyright  2014 elsevier inc all rights reserved
