beyond obvious functions in haemostasis and thrombosis platelets are considered to be essential in proinflammatory surroundings such as atherosclerosis allergy rheumatoid arthritis and even cancerin atherosclerosis platelets facilitate the recruitment of inflammatory cells towards the lesion sites and release a plethora of inflammatory mediators thereby enriching and boosting the inflammatory milieuplatelets do so by interacting with endothelial cells circulating leukocytes monocytes neutrophils dendritic cells tcells and progenitor cellsthis crosstalk enforces leukocyte activation adhesion and transmigrationfurthermore platelets are known to function in innate host defense through the release of antimicrobial peptides and the expression of pattern recognition receptorsin severe sepsis platelets are able to trigger the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps nets which bind and clear pathogensthe present antiplatelet therapies that target key pathways of platelet activation and aggregation therefore hold the potential to modulate plateletderived immune functions by reducing cellular interactions of platelets with other immune components and by reducing the secretion of inflammatory proteins into the milieuthe objective of this review is to update and discuss the current perceptions of the platelet immune constituents and their prospect as therapeutic targets in an atherosclerotic setting
