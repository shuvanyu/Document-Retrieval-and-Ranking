coronary artery disease is responsible for much mortality and morbidity around the worldplatelets are involved in atherosclerotic disease development and the reduction of platelet activity by medications reduces the incidence and severity of diseasered wine and grapes contain polyphenolic compounds including flavonoids which can reduce platelet aggregation and have been associated with lower rates of cardiovascular diseasecitrus fruits contain different classes of polyphenolics that may not share the same propertiesthis study evaluated whether commercial grape orange and grapefruit juices taken daily reduce ex vivo platelet activityin a randomized crossover design ten healthy human subjects ages 2658 y five of each gender drank 575 mlkgd of purple grape juice orange juice or grapefruit juice for 710 d eachplatelet aggregation whole blood impedance aggregometry chronolog model 590 at baseline was compared to results after consumption of each juicedrinking purple grape juice for one week reduced the whole blood platelet aggregation response to 1 mgl of collagen by 77 from 179  23 to 40  68 ohms p  00002orange juice and grapefruit juice had no effect on platelet aggregationthe purple grape juice had approximately three times the total polyphenolic concentration of the citrus juices and was a potent platelet inhibitor in healthy subjects while the citrus juices showed no effectthe platelet inhibitory effect of the flavonoids in grape juice may decrease the risk of coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction
