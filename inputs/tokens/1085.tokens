a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is known to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseasehowever the information regarding the antithrombotic activity antiplatelet anticoagulant and fibrinolytic of fruits and vegetables is scarcethe aim of this study was to assess the antithrombotic activity of extracts from fruits and vegetables widely consumed in central chilethe study included samples of 19 fruits and 26 vegetables representative of the local dietthe extracts prepared from each sample included an aqueous juice or pressed solubles andor methanolsoluble fractionthe extracts were evaluated for antiplatelet anticoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in vitro at a final concentration of 1 mgmlthe antiplatelet activity was assessed by platelet aggregation inhibition anticoagulant activity was measured by the prothrombin time pt diluted prothrombin time dpt activated partial thromboplastin time aptt kaolin clotting time kct and thrombin timethe fibrinolytic effect was determined with the euglobin clot lysis time and fibrin plate methodsextracts of green beans and tomatoes inhibited platelet aggregation induced by adp and arachidonic acid in a concentrationdependent mannerthe methanolic extracts of grapes prolonged the pt and dptfinally extracts of raspberry prolonged the aptt and also presented fibrinolytic activityin conclusion from a screening that included a variety of fruits and vegetables we found antiplatelet activity in green beans and tomatoes anticoagulant activities in grapes and raspberries whereas fibrinolytic activity was observed only in raspberriesfurther investigations are necessary to advance in knowledge of the active compounds of these fruits and vegetables and their mechanisms of action
