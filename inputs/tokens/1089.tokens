in this study genotoxicity of two mouthwash products chlorexidin benzidaminehcl were investigated in the drosophila wingspot test which makes use of the wing cell markers multiple wing hairs mwh and flare flr and detects both mitotic recombination and various types of mutational eventsinduced mutations are detected as single mosaic spots on the wing blade of surviving adults that show either the multiple wing hairs or flare phenotypeinduced recombination leads to mwh and flr twin spots and also to some extent to mwh single spotsrecording of the frequency and the size of different spots is allowed for a quantitative determination of the mutagenic and recombinogenic effectstransheterozygous thirdinstar larvae were treated at different concentrations of the mouthwash productschlorexidin exposure concentrations were 05 1 and 2mgmlbenzidaminehcl exposure concentrations were 038 075 and 15mgmlin addition the observed mutations were classified according to size and type of mutation per wingboth chlorexidin and benzidaminehcl were genotoxic in terms of total mutations per wing at the highest dosessurvival rates of flies used in the experiments were significantly lower than those of the control group with both mouthwash products showing toxic effects on drosophila melanogaster larvaecopyright c 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
