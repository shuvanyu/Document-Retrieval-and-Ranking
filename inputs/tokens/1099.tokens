watersoluble dietary fibers from apple peels and waterinsoluble dietary fibers from wheat bran and soybeanseed hull were used to evaluate their binding capacities for four toxic elements pb hg cd and as lard cholesterol and bile acidsthe watersoluble dietary fibers showed a higher binding capacity for three toxic cations cholesterol and sodium cholate and a lower binding capacity for lard compared to the waterinsoluble onesa mixture of the dietary fibers from all samples  apple peels wheat bran and soybeanseed hull  in the ratio 244 ww significantly increased the binding capacity of waterinsoluble dietary fibers for the three toxic cations cholesterol and sodium cholate moreover the mixture could lower the concentrations of pb2 and cd in the tested solutions to levels lower than those occurring in rice and vegetables grown in polluted soilshowever all the tested fibers showed a low binding capacity for the toxic anion aso33copyright  2010published by elsevier bv
