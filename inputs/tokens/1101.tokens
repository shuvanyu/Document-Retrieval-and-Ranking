the notion that a breastgut connection might modulate the microenvironment of breast tissue was supported by the finding that breast cyst fluid contains bile acids that are characteristically found in the intestinesto establish that the gut rather than circulating steroid precursors is the source of bile acids in breast cyst fluid we gave two patients deuteriumlabelled chenodeoxycholic acid three 200 mg doses by mouth starting 9 days before aspiration of breast cyststhe chenodeoxycholic acid concentration of seven samples of aspirated cyst fluid ranged from 42 to 94 mumollthe corresponding serum concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid on the same day were 08 and 29 mumoll of which the labelled compound comprised 130 038 mumoll and 282 023 mumollthe deuterated chenodeoxycholic acid concentrations in cyst fluid were 079 and 126 mumoll in two samples from patient 1 and 322 mumoll in patient 2 these values are equivalent to 1117 of the serum concentrations correctedthis study shows that intestinal bile acids rapidly gain access to cyst fluidfurther studies should investigate the mechanisms that govern the exchange processes and the maintenance of the high cyst fluid to plasma concentration gradients and the biological halflives of individual constituents
