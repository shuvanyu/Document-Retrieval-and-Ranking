objective high concentrations of plasma deoxycholic acid dca are found in human breast cyst fluid and it has been hypothesised that this may be related to risk of breast cancerthe aim of this pilot study was to ascertain whether plasma bile acid concentrations were greater in women with breast cancerdesign a casecontrol study comparing postmenopausal women with breast cancer with healthy controls was conductedsubjects twenty caucasian postmenopausal breast cancer patients were recruited at the time of diagnosis together with 20 healthy controls matched for age and body mass indexexclusion criteria included any treatment for breast cancer use of hormone replacement therapy in the last 12 months diabetes mellitus a history of liver or gall bladder disease or abnormal liver functionmeasurements fasting plasma bile acid concentrations were determined by gasliquid chromatographymass spectrometryresults the mean plasma dca concentration was 52 higher p0012 in patients with breast cancer compared with controlsconclusion these results support the hypothesis that dca may be involved in the aetiology of breast cancer
