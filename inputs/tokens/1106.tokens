intestinal transit has a substantial influence on the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and steroid hormones on colonic ph and on short chain fatty acid concentrations in the distal colonslow transit is likely to favor disease processes that are related to overefficient enterohepatic recirculation and to lack of short chain fatty acid in the distal colonthese include gallstones large bowel cancer and possibly breast cancerthe bestdocumented influence of slow colonic transit is on bile acid metabolismslowing colonic transit increases deoxycholate and raises cholesterol saturation of bile making gallstone formation more likelyin this review we also examine the evidence that slow colonic transit may be important in the etiology of large bowel and breast cancerthere is a lack of data pertaining to the relationship between colonic transit and diseases such as colon and breast cancershould slow colonic transit prove to be a significant factor in the etiology of such diseases then the health of the population might benefit from dietary and lifestyle changes that speed up intestinal transit
