acne in adolescents of developed countries is an epidemic skin disease and has currently been linked to the western diet wdit is the intention of this viewpoint to discuss the possible impact of wdmediated nutrient signalling in the pathogenesis of acnehigh glycaemic load and dairy protein consumption both increase insulininsulinlike growth factor1 igf1 signalling iis that is superimposed on elevated igf1 signalling of pubertythe cells nutritional status is primarily sensed by the forkhead box transcription factor o1 foxo1 and the serinethreonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1increased iis extrudes foxo1 into the cytoplasm whereas nuclear foxo1 suppresses hepatic igf1 synthesis and thus impairs somatic growthfoxo1 attenuates androgen signalling interacts with regulatory proteins important for sebaceous lipogenesis regulates the activity of innate and adaptive immunity antagonizes oxidative stress and most importantly functions as a rheostat of mtorc1 the master regulator of cell growth proliferation and metabolic homoeostasisthus foxo1 links nutrient availability to mtorc1driven processes increased protein and lipid synthesis cell proliferation cell differentiation including hyperproliferation of acroinfundibular keratinocytes sebaceous gland hyperplasia increased sebaceous lipogenesis insulin resistance and increased body mass indexenhanced androgen tnfÎ± and igf1 signalling due to genetic polymorphisms promoting the risk of acne all converge in mtorc1 activation which is further enhanced by nutrient signalling of wddeeper insights into the molecular interplay of foxo1mtorc1mediated nutrient signalling are thus of critical importance to understand the impact of wd on the promotion of epidemic acne and more serious mtorc1driven diseases of civilization
