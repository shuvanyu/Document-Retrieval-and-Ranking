dietary pufa mainly those of the n3 family are known to play essential roles in the maintenance of energy balance and in the reduction of body fat deposition through the upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling that is the main source of reactive oxygen specieswe hypothesized that rat supplementation with raw donkeys milk dm characterized by lowfat content and higher n3n6 ratio may affect energy balance lipid metabolism and prooxidant status as compared to animals treated with cows milkin the present study the effects of drinking raw dm for 4 weeks on energy balance lipid metabolism antiinflammatory and antioxidantdetoxifying defences was compared to that produced by rat intake of an isoenergetic amount of raw cows milkthe hypolipidemic effect produced by dm paralleled with the enhanced mitochondrial activityproton leakage and with the increased activity or expression of mitochondrial markers namely carnitine palmitoyl transferase and uncoupling protein 2the association of decreased energy efficiency with reduced proinflammatory signs tnfÎ± and lps levels with the significant increase antioxidant total thiols and detoxifying enzyme activities glutathionestransferase nadh quinone oxidoreductase in dmtreated animals indicated that beneficial effects were attributable at least in part to the activation of nuclear factor 2 erythroidrelated factor 2 pathway 2012 wileyvch verlag gmbh  co kgaa weinheim
