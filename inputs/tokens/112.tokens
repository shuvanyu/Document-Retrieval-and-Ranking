background and aim the mediterranean diet medd has long been associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular diseaselittle information is available on association between medd vitamins intake and arrhythmiaswe sought to investigate the relationship between adherence to medd antioxidants intake and spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation afmethods and results a group of 800 subjects was included in a casecontrol study 400 of them had a first detected episode of afnutritional parameters were assessed by a selfadministered food frequency validated questionnaire and completed by an intervieweradministered 7 days diet recalladherence to medd was evaluated using the mediterranean score and intake of antioxidants from food was calculatedadherence to the med diet was lower in patients that developed af compared to control mean med score 223  31 vs 279  56 p  0001the median value was 235 q1q3 range 2330 in patients with af and 274 q1q3 range 2633the estimated intake of total antioxidants was lower in patients with af 135  83 vs 182  94 mmold p  0001patients in the highest quartile of mediterranean score had higher probability of spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation or19 95ci 158281high levels of antioxidants intake were also associated with an increasing probability of spontaneous conversion of arrhythmia or18 95ci 156299 p  001conclusions patients with atrial fibrillation had lower adherence to medd and lower antioxidant intake compared to control populationmoreover patients with arrhythmia showing a higher med score had more probability of a spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillationcopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
