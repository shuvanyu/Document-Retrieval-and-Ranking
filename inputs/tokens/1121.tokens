increased protein supply by feeding cowmilkbased infant formula in comparison to lower protein content of human milk is a wellrecognized major risk factor of childhood obesityhowever there is yet no conclusive biochemical concept explaining the mechanisms of formulainduced childhood obesityit is the intention of this article to provide the biochemical link between leucinemediated signalling of mammalian milk proteins and adipogenesis as well as early adipogenic programmingleucine has been identified as the predominant signal transducer of mammalian milk which stimulates the nutrientsensitive kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mtorc1leucine thus functions as a maternalneonatal relay for mtorc1dependent neonatal Î²cell proliferation and insulin secretionthe mtorc1 target s6k1 plays a pivotal role in stimulation of mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into adipocytes and to induce insulin resistanceit is of most critical concern that infant formulas provide higher amounts of leucine in comparison to human milkexaggerated leucinemediated mtorc1s6k1 signalling induced by infant formulas may thus explain increased adipogenesis and generation of lifelong elevated adipocyte numbersattenuation of mtorc1 signalling of infant formula by leucine restriction to physiologic lower levels of human milk offers a great chance for the prevention of childhood obesity and obesityrelated metabolic diseases
