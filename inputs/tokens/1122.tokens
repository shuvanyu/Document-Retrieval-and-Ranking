the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor is a conserved protein kinase involved in a multitude of cellular processes including cell growthincreased mtor activation is observed in multiple human cancers and inhibition of mtor has proven efficacious in numerous clinical trialsmtor comprises two complexes termed mtorc1 and mtorc2both complexes respond to growth factors whereas only mtorc1 is controlled by nutrients such as glucose and amino acidssince the discovery of mtor extensive studies have intricately detailed the molecular mechanisms by which mtorc1 is regulatedsomewhat paradoxically amino acid induced mtorc1 activationarguably the most essential stimulus leading to mtorc1 activationis the least understoodhere we review the current knowledge of nutrient dependent regulation of mtorc1
