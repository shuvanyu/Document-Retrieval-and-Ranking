in metazoans tor is an essential protein that functions as a master regulator of cellular growth and proliferationover the past decade there has been an explosion of information about this critical master kinase ranging from the composition of the tor protein complex to its ability to act as an integrator of numerous extracellular signalsunfortunately this plethora of information has also raised numerous questions regarding tor functioncurrently the prevailing view is that mammalian tor mtor exists in at least two molecular complexes mtorc1 and mtorc2 which are largely defined by the presence of either raptor or rictorhowever additional cofactors have been identified for each complex and their importance in mediating mtor signals has been incompletely elucidatedsimilarly there are differences in mtor function that reflect the tissue of originin this review we present an alternative view to mtor complex formation and function which envisions mtor regulation and signal propagation as a reflection of cell type and basal statedependent conditionsthe reinterpretation of mtor biology in this framework may facilitate the design of therapies most likely to effectively inhibit this central regulator of cell behavior
