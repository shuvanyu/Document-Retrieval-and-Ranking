the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor is a protein kinase that plays key roles in cellular regulationit forms complexes with additional proteinsthe bestunderstood one is mtor complex 1 mtorc1the regulation and cellular functions of mtorc1 have been the subjects of intense study despite this many questions remain to be answeredthey include questions about the actual mechanisms by which mtorc1 signaling is stimulated by hormones and growth factors which involves the small gtpase rheb and by amino acids which involves other gtpase proteinsthe control of rheb and the mechanism by which it activates mtorc1 remain incompletely understoodalthough it has been known for many years that rapamycin interferes with some functions of mtorc1 it is not known how it does this or why only some functions of mtorc1 are affectedmtorc1 regulates diverse cellular functionsseveral mtorc1 substrates are now known although in several cases their physiological roles are poorly or incompletely understoodin the case of several processes although it is clear that they are regulated by mtorc1 it is not known how mtorc1 does thislastly mtorc1 is implicated in ageing but again it is unclear what mechanisms account for thisgiven the importance of mtorc1 signaling both for cellular functions and in human disease it is a high priority to gain further insights into the control of mtorc1 signaling and the mechanisms by which it controls cellular functions and animal physiology
