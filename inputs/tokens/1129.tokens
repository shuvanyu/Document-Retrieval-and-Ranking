prostate cancer pca is dependent on androgen receptor signaling and aberrations of the pi3kaktmtorc1 pathway mediating excessive and sustained growth signalingthe nutrientsensitive kinase mtorc1 is upregulated in nearly 100 of advanced human pcasoncogenic mtorc1 signaling activates key subsets of mrnas that cooperate in distinct steps of pca initiation and progressionepidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of pcamtorc1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis lipid synthesis and autophagy pathways that couple nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancerthis review provides evidence that pca initiation and progression are promoted by cows milk but not human milk stimulation of mtorc1 signalingmammalian milk is presented as an endocrine signaling system which activates mtorc1 promotes cell growth and proliferation and suppresses autophagynaturally milkmediated mtorc1 signaling is restricted only to the postnatal growth phase of mammalshowever persistent consumption of cows milk proteins in humans provide highly insulinotropic branchedchain amino acids bcaas provided by milks fast hydrolysable whey proteins which elevate postprandial plasma insulin levels and increase hepatic igf1 plasma concentrations by caseinderived amino acidsbcaas insulin and igf1 are pivotal activating signals of mtorc1increased cows milk proteinmediated mtorc1 signaling along with constant exposure to commercial cows milk estrogens derived from pregnant cows may explain the observed association between high dairy consumption and increased risk of pca in westernized societiesas wellbalanced mtorc1signaling plays an important role in appropriate prostate morphogenesis and differentiation exaggerated mtorc1signaling by high cows milk consumption predominantly during critical growth phases of prostate development and differentiation may exert longterm adverse effects on prostate healthattenuation of mtorc1 signaling by contemporary paleolithic diets and restriction of dairy protein intake especially during mtorc1dependent phases of prostate development and differentiation may offer protection from the most common dairypromoted cancer in men of western societies
