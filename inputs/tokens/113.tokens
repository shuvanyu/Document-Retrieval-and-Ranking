background energy drink consumption has been anecdotally linked with sudden cardiac death and more recently myocardial infarctionas myocardial infarction is strongly associated with both platelet and endothelial dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that energy drink consumption alters platelet and endothelial functionmethods fifty healthy volunteers 34 male aged 222 years participated in the studyplatelet aggregation and endothelial function were tested before and 1 hour after the consumption of 250 ml 1 can of a sugarfree energy drinkplatelet function was assessed by adenosine diphosphateinduced 1 micromoll optical aggregometry in plateletrich plasmaendothelial function was assessed via changes in peripheral arterial tonometry and expressed as the reactive hyperemia index rhiresults compared with baseline values there was a significant increase in platelet aggregation following energy drink consumption while no change was observed with control 13737 vs 0308 aggregation respectively p 01similarly rhi decreased following energy drink consumption 033013 vs 007012 rhi control p 05mean arterial pressure significantly increased following energy drink consumption compared with control p 05heart rate was unaffected by energy drink consumptionconclusion energy drink consumption acutely increases platelet aggregation and decreases endothelial function in healthy young adultscopyright c 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
