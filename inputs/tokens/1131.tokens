context restricting caloric intake is one of the most effective ways to extend lifespan and to reduce spontaneous tumor occurrence in experimental animals but whether similar associations hold in humans has not been appropriately studiedobjective to determine whether caloric restriction in early life reduces the risk of invasive breast cancerdesign setting and participants retrospective cohort study using data from the swedish inpatient registry the swedish cancer registry the swedish death registry and the swedish fertility registryparticipants were 7303 swedish women hospitalized for anorexia nervosa prior to age 40 years between 1965 and 1998women were excluded n  31 if they were diagnosed with cancer prior to their first discharge from hospitalization for anorexia nervosamain outcome measure incidence of invasive breast cancerresults compared with the swedish general population women hospitalized for anorexia nervosa prior to age 40 years had a 53 95 confidence interval ci 381 lower incidence of breast cancer nulliparous women with anorexia nervosa had a 23 95 ci 79 higher to 75 lower lower incidence and parous women with anorexia nervosa had a 76 95 ci 1397 lower incidenceconclusions severe caloric restriction in humans may confer protection from invasive breast cancerlow caloric intake prior to first birth followed by a subsequent pregnancy appears to be associated with an even more pronounced reduction in risk
