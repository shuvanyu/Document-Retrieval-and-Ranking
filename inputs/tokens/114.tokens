backgroundobjectives coffee is the most widely consumed beverage in the world but its effect on the cardiovascular system has not been fully understoodcoffee contains caffeine and antioxidants which may influence endothelial function both of which have not yet been investigatedthe objective of this study was to investigate the acute effects of coffee on endothelial function measured by brachial artery flowmediated dilation fmdsubjectsmethods a total of 20 10 males and 10 females healthy nonobese subjects underwent a doubleblind crossover studysubjects ingested one cup of caffeinated cc and one cup of decaffeinated dc italian espresso coffee in random order at 5 to 7day intervalsresults following cc ingestion fmd decreased progressively and significantly meansem 0 min 7706 30 min 6307 60 min 6008 anova analysis of variance p005 but it did not significantly increase after dc ingestion 0 min 6906 30 min 8109 60 min 8509 p0115similarly cc significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure this effect was not observed after dc ingestionblood glucose concentrations remained unchanged after ingestion of both cc and dc but insulin 0 min 15809 60 min 15008 muuml p005 and cpeptide 0 min 125009 60 min 118009 ngml p001 blood concentrations decreased significantly only after cc ingestionconclusions cc acutely induced unfavorable cardiovascular effects especially on endothelial functionin the fasting state insulin secretion is also likely reduced after cc ingestionfuture studies will determine whether cc has detrimental clinically relevant effects especially in unhealthy subjects
