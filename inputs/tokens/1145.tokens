obesity has been recognized as a key component of the metabolic syndrome a cluster of risk factors associated with diabetes and cardiovascular morbidityin addition obesity has been linked to higher frequency of cancers in a variety of tissues including the liverliver cancer most often occurs as hepatocellular carcinoma hcc complicating cirrhosis due to chronic viral infection or toxic injury and remains the third leading cause of cancer death in the worldhowever hcc is increasingly diagnosed among individuals with obesity and related disordersas these metabolic conditions have become globally prevalent they coexist with wellestablished risk factors of hcc and create a unique challenge for the liver as a chronically diseased organobesityassociated hcc has recently been attributed to molecular mechanisms such as chronic inflammation due to adipose tissue remodeling and proinflammatory adipokine secretion ectopic lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity altered gut microbiota and disrupted senescence in stellate cells as well as insulin resistance leading to increased levels of insulin and insulinlike growth factorsthese mechanisms synergize with those occurring in chronic liver disease resulting from other etiologies and accelerate the development of hcc before or after the onset of cirrhosisincreasingly common interactions between oncogenic pathways linked to obesity and chronic liver disease may explain why hcc is one of the few malignancies with rising incidence in developed countriesbetter understanding of this complex process will improve our strategies of cancer prevention prediction and surveillancepublished by elsevier inc
