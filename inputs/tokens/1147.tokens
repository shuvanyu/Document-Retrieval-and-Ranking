background coffee is associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic c hepatitisthis prospective trial was aimed at assessing the mechanisms underlying coffeerelated protective effectsmethods forty patients with chronic hepatitis c were randomized into two groups the first consumed 4 cups of coffeeday for 30 days while the second remained coffee abstinentat day 30 the groups were switched over for a second monthresults at baseline aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were lower in patients drinking 35 group b than 02 cupsday group a 56  6 vs 74  1160  3 vs 73  7 ul p005p004 respectivelyhcvrna levels were significantly higher in group b 62  15  105vs 39  10  105uiml p005during coffee intake 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine and collagen levels were significantly lower than during abstinence 15  3 vs 44  16 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine105deoxyguanosine p005 and 56  9 vs 86  21 ngml p004telomere length was significantly higher in patients during coffee intake 068  006 vs 048  004 arbitrary units p0006telomere length and 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine were inversely correlatedconclusion in chronic hepatitis c coffee consumption induces a reduction in oxidative damage correlated with increased telomere length and apoptosis with lower collagen synthesis factors that probably mediate the protection exerted by coffee with respect to disease progressioncopyright  2012 editrice gastroenterologica italiana srlpublished by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
