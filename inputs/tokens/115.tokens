caffeine is the most widely used pharmacologic substance in the worldit is found in common nonessential grocery items eg coffee tea cocoa and chocolatethe effects of caffeine on cardiovascular diseases including hypertension remain controversial and there is little information on its direct effect on vascular functionthe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of caffeine on endothelial function in humansthis study was a doubleblind randomized placebo and active drug studyforearm blood flow fbf responses to acetylcholine ach an endotheliumdependent vasodilator and to sodium nitroprusside an endotheliumindependent vasodilator were evaluated in healthy young men before and after the oral administration of caffeine 300 mg n  10 or placebo n  10fbf was measured by using a straingauge plethysmographcaffeine significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 60  60 and 26  31 mm hg p 005 respectively but did not alter heart rate or baseline fbfcaffeine augmented the fbf responses to ach from 212  71 to 266  81 mlmin100 ml tissue p 005 whereas sodium nitroprussidestimulated vasodilation was not altered by caffeine administrationthe intraarterial infusion of ngmonomethyllarginine a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor abolished the caffeineinduced augmentation of fbf response to achin the placebo group the ach and sodium nitroprussidestimulated vasodilation was similar before and after the followup periodin conclusion these findings suggest that the acute administration of caffeine augments endotheliumdependent vasodilation in healthy young men through an increase in nitric oxide production
