aims coffee consumption has been recently linked with decreased blood gammaglutamyltransferase ggt activities and protection from alcoholic liver diseaseto explore the relationship and dose response we assessed the impacts of coffee and alcohol intake on serum ggt activity in apparently healthy men and women with varying levels of coffee and alcohol consumptionmethods data on coffee alcohol consumption and serum ggt activities were collected from 18899 individuals 8807 men and 10092 women mean age 48 years range 2574 years who participated in a large national crosssectional health surveybody mass index smoking index and age were used as covariates in all analysesresults among the study population 898 reported varying levels of coffee consumption 69 were abstainers from alcohol 861 moderate drinkers 37 heavy drinkers and 33 former drinkersin men the elevation of ggt induced by heavy drinking 280 gweek was found to be significantly reduced by coffee consumption exceeding 4 cups per daya similar trend was also observed among women which however did not reach statistical significanceconclusion coffee modulates the effect of ethanol on serum ggt activities in a dose and genderdependent mannerthese observations should be implicated in studies on the possible hepatoprotective effects of coffee in alcohol consumers
