death of dopaminergic neurons in parkinsons disease pd may partially be caused by synthesis and accumulation of endogenous and exogenous toxinsbecause of structural similarity to mptp betacarbolines like norharman and harman have been proposed as putative neurotoxinsin vivo they may easily be formed by cyclization of indoleamines with egaldehydesfor further elucidation of the role of betacarbolines in neurodegenerative disorders harman and norharman levels in cerebrospinal fluid csf were measured in 14 patients with pd and compared to an age and sexmatched control group n  14csf levels of norharman and harman in pd were significantly higher compared to controlsthese results may suggest a possible role of harman and norharman or its nmethylated carbolinium ions in the pathophysiological processes initiating pdhowever the origin of increased levels of these betacarbolines remains unclearon the one hand one may speculate that unknown metabolic processes induce the increased synthesis of harman and norharman in pdon the other hand a possible impact of exogenous sources may also be possible
