essential tremor et is a widespread latelife neurological diseasegenetic and environmental factors are likely to play important etiological rolesharmane 1methyl9hpyrido34bindole is a potent tremorproducing neurotoxinpreviously elevated blood harmane concentrations were demonstrated in et cases compared to controls but these observations were all been crosssectional assessing each subject at only one time pointthus no one has ever repeatassayed blood harmane in the same subjects twicewhether the observed casecontrol difference persists at a second time point years later is unknownthe current goal was to reassess a sample of our et cases and controls to determine whether blood harmane concentration remained elevated in et at a second time pointblood harmane concentrations were quantified by a wellestablished high performance liquid chromatography method in 63 et cases and 70 controlsa mean of approximately 6 years elapsed between the initial and this subsequent blood harmane determinationthe mean log blood harmane concentration was significantly higher in cases than controls 030  061 g10ml vs 008  055 g10ml and the median value in cases was double that of controls 022 g10ml vs 011 g10mlthe log blood harmane concentration was highest in cases with a family history of etblood harmane concentration was elevated in et cases compared to controls when reassessed at a second time point several years later indicating what seems to be a stable association between this environmental toxin and et
