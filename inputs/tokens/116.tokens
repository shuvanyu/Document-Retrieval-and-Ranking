approximately 75 of all kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium oxalate and hyperoxaluria is a primary risk factor for this disordernine types of raw and cooked vegetables were analyzed for oxalate using an enzymatic methodthere was a high proportion of watersoluble oxalate in most of the tested raw vegetablesboiling markedly reduced soluble oxalate content by 3087 and was more effective than steaming 553 and baking used only for potatoes no oxalate lossan assessment of the oxalate content of cooking water used for boiling and steaming revealed an approximately 100 recovery of oxalate lossesthe losses of insoluble oxalate during cooking varied greatly ranging from 0 to 74because soluble sources of oxalate appear to be better absorbed than insoluble sources employing cooking methods that significantly reduce soluble oxalate may be an effective strategy for decreasing oxaluria in individuals predisposed to the development of kidney stones
