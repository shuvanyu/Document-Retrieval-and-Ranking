essential tremor et is among the most prevalent neurological diseases yet its etiology is not well understoodsusceptibility genotypes undoubtedly underlie many et cases although no genes have been identified thus farenvironmental factors are also likely to contribute to the etiology of etharmane 1methyl9hpyrido34βindole is a potent tremorproducing βcarboline alkaloid and emerging literature has provided initial links between this neurotoxin and etin this report we review this literaturetwo studies both in new york have demonstrated higher blood harmane levels in et cases than controls and in one study especially high levels in familial et casesreplication studies of populations outside of new york and studies of brain harmane levels in et have yet to be undertakena small number of studies have explored several of the biological correlates of exposure to harmane in et patientsstudies of the mechanisms of this putative elevation of harmane in et have explored the role of increased dietary consumption finding weak evidence of increased exogenous intake in male et cases and other studies have found initial evidence that the elevated harmane in et might be due to a hereditarily reduced capacity to metabolize harmane to harmine 7methoxy1methyl9hpyrido34βindolestudies of harmane and its possible association with et have been intriguingadditional studies are needed to establish more definitively whether these toxic exposures are associated with et and are of etiological importance
