mptp 1methyl4phenyl1236tetrahydropyridine causes selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway in humans and other primatesit is less specific and much less potent in mice and has only slight effects in ratsdifferences in rates and sites of metabolism of mptp to its active toxic highly polar metabolite mpp 1methyl4phenylpyridine appear to influence species specificityin rats type b monoamine oxidase maob which mediates the conversion of mptp to mpp may act as an enzymatic barrier at brain microvessels whereas in primates the enzyme present mainly in astrocytes appears important for bioactivation of mptp into the toxic metabolitempp is a substrate for catecholamine uptake sites and is concentrated in these neuronsthe molecular mechanism of mpp toxicity has not been established definitively but conversion to a free radical or uptake by mitochondria and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes leading to calcium release and cell death have been suggestedthe discovery of toxin which causes an animal model of parkinsons disease has stimulated new research on environmental factors that might contribute to this progressive degenerative disorder and provides a means for assessing new approaches to therapy
