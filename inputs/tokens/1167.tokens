the aromatic betacarbolines norharman and harman have been implicated in a number of human diseases including parkinsons disease tremor addiction and cancerit has been shown that these compounds are normal body constituents formed endogenously but external sources have been identifiedhere we summarise literature data on levels of norharman and harman in fried meat and fish meat extracts alcoholic drinks and coffee brewsother sources include edible and medicinal plants but tobacco smoke has been identified as a major sourceexposure levels from these different dietary sources are estimated to a maximum of 4 microg norharman per kg body weight bw per day and 1 microg harman per kg bw per dayexposure via tobacco smoke depends on smoking habits and type of cigarettes but can be estimated to 11 microgkg bw for norharman and 06 microgkg bw for harman per package of cigarettes smokedstudies on toxicokinetics indicate that inhalative exposure leads to a rapid increase in plasma levels and high bioavailability of norharman and harmanoral bioavailability is lower but there are indications that sublingual absorption may increase dietary uptake of betacarbolinesendogenous formation can be estimated to be 50100 ngkg bw per day for norharman and about 20 ngkg bw per day for harman but these rates may increase with high intake of precursorsbiomarker studies on plasma levels of betacarbolines reported on elevated levels of norharman harman or both in diseased patients alcoholics and following tobacco smoking or consumption of betacarbolinecontaining foodcigarette smoking has been identified as major influence but dietary exposure may contribute to exposure
