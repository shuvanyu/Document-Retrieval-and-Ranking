background tremor is a widespread phenomenon in human populationsenvironmental factors are likely to play an etiological roleharmane 1methyl9hpyrido34βindole is a potent tremorproducing βcarboline alkaloidlead is another tremorproducing neurotoxicantthe effects of harmane and lead with respect to tremor have been studied in isolationobjectives we tested the hypothesis that tremor would be particularly severe among individuals who had high blood concentrations of both of these toxicantsmethods blood concentrations of harmane and lead were each quantified in 257 individuals 106 essential tremor cases and 151 controls enrolled in an environmental epidemiological studytotal tremor score range  0  36 was a clinical measure of tremor severityresults the total tremor score ranged from 0  36 indicating that a full spectrum of tremor severities was captured in our sampleblood harmane concentration correlated with total tremor score p  0007 as did blood lead concentration p  0045the total tremor score was lowest in participants with both low blood harmane and lead concentrations 84  82 intermediate in participants with high concentrations of either toxicant 105  98 and highest in participants with high concentrations of both toxicants 137  104p  001conclusions blood harmane and lead concentrations separately correlated with total tremor scoresparticipants with high blood concentrations of both toxicants had the highest tremor scores suggesting an additive effect of these toxicants on tremor severitygiven the very high population prevalence of tremor disorders identifying environmental determinants is important for primary disease prevention
