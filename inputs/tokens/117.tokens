oxalate bioavailability from sugar beet fibre 40 g spinach 25 g and a solution of sodium oxalate 182 mg was tested in nine women using a triplicated 3 x 3 latin square arrangementeach test substance provided 120 mg oxalic acidthroughout the study the volunteers consumed a control diet and the test substances were administered at breakfast on specified daysafter an initial 2day control period oxalate was administered in three test periods that consisted of one test day followed by one control dayurine collected during 24hr periods was analysed daily for oxalateoxalate excretion did not differ among the five control days and was not increased significantly following the ingestion of sugar beet fibre by the volunteersoxalate excretion was greater p less than 00001 for the mean of the spinach and sodium oxalate solution diets than for the mean of the sugar beet fibre and control dietsoxalate bioavailability from sugar beet fibre was 07 compared with bioavailabilities of 45 and 62 for spinach and oxalate solutions respectivelythe low bioavailability of oxalate from sugar beet fibre may be attributable to its high ratio of minerals calcium and magnesium to oxalate its complex fibre matrix or the loss of the soluble oxalate during processing of sugar beets
