background little is known about the impact of location of food consumption and preparation upon daily energy intake for childrenobjective to examine trends in daily energy intake by children for foods eaten at home or awayfromhome by source of preparation and for combined categories of eating location and food sourcesubjects the analysis uses data from 29217 children aged 218 years from the 19771978 nationwide food consumption survey 19891991 and 19941998 continuing survey of food intake by individuals and 20032006 national health and nutrition examination surveysmethods nationally representative weighted percentages and means of daily energy intake by eating location were analyzed for trends from 1977 to 2006comparisons by food source were examined from 1994 to 2006analyses were repeated for 3 age groups 26 712 and 1318 year oldsdifference testing was conducted using a t testresults increased energy intake 179 kcald by children from 19772006 was associated with a major increase in calories eaten awayfromhome 255 kcaldthe percentage of kcald eaten awayfromhome increased from 234 to 339 from 19772006no further increase was observed from 19942006 but the sources of calories shiftedthe percentage of calories from fast food increased to surpass intake from schools and become the largest contributor to foods prepared awayfromhome for all age groupsfor foods eaten awayfromhome the percentage of kcald from stores increased to become the largest source of calories eaten awayfromhomefast food eaten at home and storebought food eaten awayfromhome increased significantlyconclusion eating location and food source significantly impact daily energy intake for childrenfoods prepared awayfromhome including fast food eaten at home and storeprepared food eaten awayfromhome are fueling the increase in total calorie intakehowever further research using alternative data sources is necessary to verify that storebought foods eaten awayfromhome are increasingly storeprepared
