the effects of baking and boiling on the nutritional and antioxidant properties of three sweet potato cultivars beniazuma koganesengan kotobuki cultivated in turkey were investigatedthe samples were analyzed for proximate composition total phenolic content ascorbic acid βcarotene antiradical activity and free sugarsthe dry matter protein and starch contents of the sweet potatoes were significantly changed by the treatments while the ash and crude fiber contents did not differ as significantlythe βcarotene contents of baked and boiled sweet potatoes were lower than those of fresh sweet potatoes however the total phenolic and ascorbic acid contents of the baked and boiled sweet potatoes were higher than those of the fresh samplesgenerally the antiradical activity of the sweet potatoes increased with the treatmentssucrose glucose and fructose were quantified as free sugars in all fresh sweet potatoes however maltose was determined in the treated samplesin terms of the analyzed parameters there were no explicit differences among the sweet potato cultivars
