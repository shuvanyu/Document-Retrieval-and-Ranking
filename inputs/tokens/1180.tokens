scope anthocyanins the natural pigments in plant foods have been associated with cancer preventionhowever the content of anthocyanins in staple foods is typically low and the mechanisms by which they exert anticancer activity is not yet fully definedmethods and results we selected an anthocyaninenriched purplefleshed sweet potato clone p40 and investigated its potential anticancer effect in both in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal modelin addition to a high level of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity p40 possesses a high content of anthocyanins at 75 mgg dry mattertreatment of human colonic sw480 cancer cells with p40 anthocyanin extracts at 040 Î¼m of peonidin3glucoside equivalent resulted in a dosedependent decrease in cell number due to cytostatic arrest of cell cycle at g1 phase but not cytotoxicityfurthermore dietary p40 at 1030 significantly suppressed azoxymethaneinduced formation of aberrant crypt foci in the colons of cf1 mice in conjunction with at least in part a lesser proliferative pcna and a greater apoptotic caspase3 expression in the colon mucosal epithelial cellsconclusion these observations coupled with both in vitro and in vivo studies reported here suggest anthocyaninenriched sweet potato p40 may protect against colorectal cancer by inducing cell cycle arrest antiproliferative and apoptotic mechanisms
