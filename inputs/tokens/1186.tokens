the initial investigation of the nature of the proteins in the tuber of sweet potato ipomoea batatas lamrevealed a globulindesignated ipomoein which was reported by jones and gersdorff 1931later ipomoein was renamed sporamin and was found to be a major storage protein that accounted for over 80 of the total protein in the tuberous rootto date sporamin has been studied by a series of biochemical and molecular approachesthe first purification of sporamin into two major fractions a and b was successfully completed in 1985several characteristics of the protein such as the diversification of the nucleotide sequences in the gene family the protein structure the biological functions of storage defense inhibitory activity and ros scavenging were identifiedin the past decade sporamin was classified as a kunitztype trypsin inhibitor and its insectresistance capability has been examined in transgenic tobacco and cauliflower plants indicating the multiple functions of this protein has evolved to facilitate the growth and development of sweet potatosporamin is constitutively expressed in the tuberous root and is not normally expressed in the stem or leaveshowever this protein is expressed systemically in response to wounding and other abiotic stressesthese dual expression patterns at the transcriptional level revealed that the complex regulatory mechanism of sporamin was modulated by environmental stressesthe versatile functions of sporamin make this storage protein a good research model to study molecular evolution regulatory mechanisms and physiological functions in plantsthis review summarizes and discusses recent approaches and future perspectives in agricultural biotechnologycopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
