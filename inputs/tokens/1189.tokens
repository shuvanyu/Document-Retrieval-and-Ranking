the objective of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative effect and the mechanism of trypsin inhibitor ti from sweet potato ipomoea batatas l lamtainong 57 storage roots on nb4 promyelocytic leukemia cellsthe results showed that ti inhibited cellular growth of nb4 promyelocytic leukemia cells in a timedependent and dosedependent manner and treatment for 72 h induced a marked inhibition of cellular growth showing an ic50 of 571  826 microgmlti caused cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase as determined by flow cytometric analysis and apoptosis as shown by dna ladderingtiinduced cell apoptosis involved p53 bcl2 bax and cytochrome c protein in nb4 cellsp53 and bax proteins were accumulated and antiapoptotic molecule bcl2 was decreased in the tested cells in a timedependent manner during ti treatmentti also induced a substantial release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosolhence ti induced apoptosis in nb4 cells through a mitochondriadependent pathway which was associated with the activation of caspase3 and 8these results demonstrated that ti induces nb4 cell apoptosis through the inhibition of cell growth and the activation of the pathway of caspase3 and 8 cascades
