coloredflesh potatoes are an excellent source of healthbenefiting dietary polyphenols but are stored for up to 36 months before consumptionthis study investigated the effect of simulated commercial storage conditions on antioxidant activity dpph abts phenolic content fcr and composition uplcms and anticancer properties early hct116 and advanced stage ht29 human colon cancer cell lines of potato bioactive compoundsextracts from seven potato clones of differing flesh colors white yellow and purple before and after 90 days of storage were used in this studythe antioxidant activity of all clones increased with storage however an increase in total phenolic content was observed only in purplefleshed clonesadvanced purplefleshed selection co972272ppw had greater levels of total phenolics monomeric anthocyanins antioxidant activity and a diverse anthocyanin composition as compared with purple majestypurplefleshed potatoes were more potent in suppressing proliferation and elevating apoptosis of colon cancer cells compared with white and yellowfleshed potatoesthe extracts from both fresh and stored potatoes 1030 Î¼gml suppressed cancer cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis compared with the solvent control but these anticancer effects were more pronounced with the fresh potatoesstorage duration had a strong positive correlation with antioxidant activity and percentage of viable cancer cells and a negative correlation with apoptosis inductionthese results suggest that although the antioxidant activity and phenolic content of potatoes were increased with storage the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities were suppressedthus in the assessment of the effects of farm to fork operations on the healthbenefiting properties of plant foods it is critical to use quantitative analytical techniques in conjunction with in vitro andor in vivo biological assays
