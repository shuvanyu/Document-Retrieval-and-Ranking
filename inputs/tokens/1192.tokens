we investigated the effects of sporamin the major soluble protein with a kunitztype trypsin inhibitory activity in the root tuber of the sweet potato on cell proliferation apoptosis aktgsk3 signaling and its related genes to provide more insights in the mechanism behind the inhibitory effects of sporamin in a human tongue cancer line tca8113in this study sporamin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in tca8113 cells in a concentrationdependent and timedependent mannerconsistently bax was upregulated and bcl2 was downregulated in sporamintreated cellsfurthermore aktgsk3 signaling was downregulated in sporamintreated cellsconsistently the phosphorylated bad was significantly declined in sporamintreated tca8113 cellsthese results suggest the antiproliferative effects of sporamin in tca8113 cells might result partly from induction of apoptosis by downregulating aktgsk3 pathway 2010 the authors fundamental and clinical pharmacology  2010 société française de pharmacologie et de thérapeutique
