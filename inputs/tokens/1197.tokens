we investigated the relationship between animal product consumption and evidence of dementia in two cohort substudiesthe first enrolled 272 california residents matched for age sex and zip code 1 vegan 1 lactoovovegetarian and 2 heavy meat eaters in each of 68 quartetsthis design ensured a wide range of dietary exposurethe second included 2984 unmatched subjects who resided within the loma linda california areaall subjects were enrolled in the adventist health studythe matched subjects who ate meat including poultry and fish were more than twice as likely to become demented as their vegetarian counterparts relative risk 218 p  0065 and the discrepancy was further widened relative risk 299 p  0048 when past meat consumption was taken into accountthere was no significant difference in the incidence of dementia in the vegetarian versus meateating unmatched subjectsthere was no obvious explanation for the difference between the two substudies although the power of the unmatched substudy to detect an effect of heavy meat consumption was unexpectedly limitedthere was a trend towards delayed onset of dementia in vegetarians in both substudies
