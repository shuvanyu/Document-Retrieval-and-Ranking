background alzheimers disease ad rates in japan and developing countries have risen rapidly in recent yearsresearchers have associated factors such as the western diet obesity alcohol consumption and smoking with risk of adobjective this paper evaluates whether the dietary transition might explain the rising trend of ad prevalence in japan and in developing countries evaluating other factors when possiblemethods this study used two approaches to see whether dietary or other changes could explain ad trends in japan and developing countriesone approach involved comparing trends of ad in japan with changes in national dietary supply factors alcohol consumption and lung cancer mortality rates from zero to 25 years before the prevalence datathe second compared ad prevalence values for eight developing countries with dietary supply factors from zero to 25 years before the prevalence dataresults for japan alcohol consumption animal product meat and rice supply and lung cancer rates correlated highly with ad prevalence data with the strongest correlation for a lag of 1525 yearsin the eightcountry study total energy and animal fat correlated highly with ad prevalence data with a lag of 1520 yearsmechanisms to explain the findings include increased obesity for the eight countries and increases in cholesterol saturated fat and iron from increases in animal products and meat supply for japanconclusion evidently ad rates will continue rising in nonwestern countries for some time unless we address major risk factors involving diet obesity and smoking
