objective to determine prevalence of dementia and its subtypes in japaneseamerican men and compare these findings with rates reported for populations in japan and elsewheredesign and setting the honolulu heart program is a prospective populationbased study of cardiovascular disease established in 1965prevalence estimates were computed from cases identified at the 1991 to 1993 examinationcognitive performance was assessed using standardized methods instruments and diagnostic criteriaparticipants subjects were 3734 japaneseamerican men 80 of surviving cohort aged 71 through 93 years living in the community or in institutionsmain outcome measures agespecific agestandardized and cohort prevalence estimates were computed for dementia all cause defined by 2 sets of diagnostic criteria and 4 levels of severityprevalence levels for alzheimer disease and vascular dementia were also estimatedresults dementia prevalence by diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders third edition revised ranged from 21 in men aged 71 through 74 years to 334 in men aged 85 through 93 yearsagestandardized prevalence was 76prevalence estimates for the cohort were 93 for dementia all cause 54 for alzheimer disease primary or contributing and 42 for vascular dementia primary or contributingmore than 1 possible cause was found in 26 of casesthe alzheimer diseasevascular dementia ratio was 15 for cases attributed primarily to alzheimer disease or vascular dementiaconclusions prevalence of alzheimer disease in older japaneseamerican men in hawaii appears to be higher than in japan but similar to europeanancestry populationsprevalence of vascular dementia appears to be slightly lower than in japan but higher than in europeanancestry populationsfurther crossnational research with emphasis on standardized diagnostic methods is needed
