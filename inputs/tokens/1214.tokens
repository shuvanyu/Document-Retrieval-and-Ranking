changes in physiological and biochemical metabolism as well as glucoraphanin and sulforaphane contents of germinating broccoli seeds and sprouts were investigated in this studysprout length root length and fresh weight increased with germination timedry weight varied from 25 to 30 mg per sprouta rapid increase in respiratory rate of sprouts occurred between 24 and 36 h of germination and then stayed at a high levelhplc analysis found that glucoraphanin content increased at the early stage 012 h of germination decreased to a low value of 302 mgg at 48 h and then reached the highest value of 630 mgg at 72 h of germinationsulforaphane content decreased dramatically during the first day of germination then increased slowly and reached a high value of 338 mgg at 48 h before declining again
