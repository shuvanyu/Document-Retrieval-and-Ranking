broccoli consumption may reduce the risk of various cancers and many broccoli supplements are now availablethe bioavailability and excretion of the mercapturic acid pathway metabolites isothiocyanates after human consumption of broccoli supplements has not been testedtwo important isothiocyanates from broccoli are sulforaphane and erucinwe employed a crossover study design in which 12 subjects consumed 40 grams of fresh broccoli sprouts followed by a 1 month washout period and then the same 12 subjects consumed 6 pills of a broccoli supplementas negative controls for isothiocyanate consumption four additional subjects consumed alfalfa sprouts during the first phase and placebo pills during the secondblood and urine samples were collected for 48 hours during each phase and analyzed for sulforaphane and erucin metabolites using lcmsmsthe bioavailability of sulforaphane and erucin is dramatically lower when subjects consume broccoli supplements compared to fresh broccoli sproutsthe peaks in plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were also delayed when subjects consumed the broccoli supplementgstp1 polymorphisms did not affect the metabolism or excretion of sulforaphane or erucinsulforaphane and erucin are able to interconvert in vivo and this interconversion is consistent within each subject but variable between subjectsthis study confirms that consumption of broccoli supplements devoid of myrosinase activity does not produce equivalent plasma concentrations of the bioactive isothiocyanate metabolites compared to broccoli sproutsthis has implications for people who consume the recommended serving size 1 pill of a broccoli supplement and believe they are getting equivalent doses of isothiocyanates
