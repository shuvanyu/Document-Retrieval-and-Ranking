the ubiquitous food contaminant cadmium has features of an estrogen mimetic that may promote the development of estrogendependent malignancies such as breast cancerhowever no prospective studies of cadmium exposure and breast cancer risk have been reportedwe examined the association between dietary cadmium exposure at baseline 1987 and the risk of overall and estrogen receptor erdefined er or er breast cancer within a populationbased prospective cohort of 55987 postmenopausal womenduring an average of 122 years of followup 2112 incident cases of invasive breast cancer were ascertained 1626 er and 290 erafter adjusting for confounders including consumption of whole grains and vegetables which account for 40 of the dietary exposure but also contain putative anticarcinogenic phytochemicals dietary cadmium intake was positively associated with overall breast cancer tumors comparing the highest tertile with the lowest rate ratio rr 121 95 confidence interval ci 107136 ptrend  002among lean and normal weight women statistically significant associations were observed for all tumors rr 127 95 ci 107150 and for er tumors rr 125 95 ci 103152 and similar but not statistically significant associations were found for er tumors rr 122 95 ci 076193the risk of breast cancer increased with increasing cadmium exposure similarly within each tertile of whole grainvegetable consumption and decreased with increasing consumption of whole grainvegetables within each tertile of cadmium exposure pinteraction  073overall these results suggest a role for dietary cadmium in postmenopausal breast cancer development
