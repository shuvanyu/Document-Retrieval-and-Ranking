previous studies on healthy subjects have shown that the intake of 6 g cinnamomum cassia reduces postprandial glucose and that the intake of 3 g c cassia reduces insulin response without affecting postprandial glucose concentrationscoumarin which may damage the liver is present in c cassia but not in cinnamomum zeylanicumthe aim of the present study was to study the effect of c zeylanicum on postprandial concentrations of plasma glucose insulin glycaemic index gi and insulinaemic index gii in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance igta total of ten subjects with igt were assessed in a crossover triala standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ogtt was administered together with placebo or c zeylanicum capsulesfingerprick capillary blood samples were taken for glucose measurements and venous blood for insulin measurements before and at 15 30 45 60 90 120 150 and 180 min after the start of the ogttthe ingestion of 6 g c zeylanicum had no significant effect on glucose level insulin response gi or giiingestion of c zeylanicum does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin levels in human subjectsthe federal institute for risk assessment in europe has suggested the replacement of c cassia by c zeylanicum or the use of aqueous extracts of c cassia to lower coumarin exposurehowever the positive effects seen with c cassia in subjects with poor glycaemic control would then be lost
