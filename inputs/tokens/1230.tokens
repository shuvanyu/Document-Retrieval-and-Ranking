studies suggested the intake of cd from diet can be approximately equivalent to that from smokingmoreover a mutual metabolic influence between cd and nutrients has been reportedthe purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between blood cadmium concentration bcdc and food consumption nutrients intake ca fe zn vitamin c and vitamin d tobacco smoking and some other variables age body mass index and residence in 243 adults living in the italian island of sardinia sassari provincespecifically we hypothesized that offal consumption contributes to cd intakes and blood levelsthe bcdc was quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and information on personal data was collected through questionnairessmoke significantly contributed to the bcdc p  001nonsmoker subjects who eat offal showed significantly higher bcdc p  04moreover slightly higher bcdcs were also observed in nonsmoker subjects who eat rice fish and breadthe bcdc positively correlated with age of subjects r  0144 p  025 and offal daily intake in nonsmokers r  0393 p  001the intake of ca was negatively correlated r  0281 p  001 with the bcdc in femalesthe multiple linear regression analysis showed smoking  consumption of offal  body mass index  age as the most important risk factors for the bcdc in the selected populationcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
