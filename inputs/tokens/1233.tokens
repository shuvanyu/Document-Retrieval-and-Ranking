background diet is a major source of cadmium intake among the nonsmoking general populationrecent studies have determined that cadmium exposure may produce adverse health effects at lower exposure levels than previously predictedwe conducted a metaanalysis to combine and analyze the results of previous studies that have investigated the association of dietary cadmium intake and cancer riskmethods we searched pubmed embase and medline database for casecontrol and cohort studies that assessed the association of dietary cadmium intake and cancer riskwe performed a metaanalysis using eight eligible studies to summarize the data and summary relative risks rrs and 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated using a random effects modelresults overall dietary cadmium intake showed no statistically significant association with cancer risk rr  110 95 ci 099122 for highest vs lowest dietary cadmium grouphowever there was strong evidence of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were conducted using the study design geographical location and cancer typein subgroup analyses the positive associations between dietary cadmium intake and cancer risk were observed among studies with western populations rr  115 95 ci 108123 and studies investigating some hormonerelated cancers prostate breast and endometrial cancersconclusion our analysis found a positive association between dietary cadmium intake and cancer risk among studies conducted in western countries particularly with hormonerelated cancersadditional experimental and epidemiological studies are required to verify our findings
