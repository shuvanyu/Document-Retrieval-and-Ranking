background lowlevel environmental cadmium exposure and neurotoxicity has not been well studied in adultsour goal was to evaluate associations between neurocognitive exam scores and a biomarker of cumulative cadmium exposure among adults in the third national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iiimethods nhanes iii is a nationally representative crosssectional survey of the us population conducted between 1988 and 1994we analyzed data from a subset of participants age 2059 who participated in a computerbased neurocognitive evaluationthere were four outcome measures the simple reaction time test srtt visual motor speed the symbol digit substitution test sdst attentionperception the serial digit learning test sdlt trialstocriterion and the sdlt totalerrorscore sdlttests learning recallshortterm memorywe fit multivariableadjusted models to estimate associations between urinary cadmium concentrations and test scoresresults 5662 participants underwent neurocognitive screening and 5572 98 of these had a urinary cadmium level availableprior to multivariableadjustment higher urinary cadmium concentration was associated with worse performance in each of the 4 outcomesafter multivariableadjustment most of these relationships were not significant and age was the most influential variable in reducing the association magnitudeshowever among neversmokers with no known occupational cadmium exposure the relationship between urinary cadmium and sdst score attentionperception was significant a 1 μgl increase in urinary cadmium corresponded to a 193 95ci 005 381 decrement in performanceconclusions these results suggest that higher cumulative cadmium exposure in adults may be related to subtly decreased performance in tasks requiring attention and perception particularly among those adults whose cadmium exposure is primarily though diet no smoking or work based cadmium exposurethis association was observed among exposure levels that have been considered to be without adverse effects and these levels are common in us adultsthus further research into the potential neurocognitive effects of cadmium exposure is warrantedbecause cumulative cadmium exposure may mediate some of the effects of age and smoking on cognition adjusting for these variables may result in the underestimation of associations with cumulative cadmium exposureprospective studies that include neversmokers and nonoccupationally exposed individuals are needed to clarify these issues
