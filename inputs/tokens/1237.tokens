mean blood cadmium bcd concentrations are two to threefold higher in smokers than in nonsmokersthe basis for this phenomenon is not well understoodwe conducted a detailed multifaceted study of cadmium exposure in smokersgroups were older smokers 624 years n  25 20 male and nonsmokers 623 years n  16 31 maleeach subjects cigarettes were machine smoked generating individually paired measures of inhaled cadmium icd versus bcd icd and bcd were each evaluated three times at monthly intervalsurine cadmium ucd was analyzed for comparisonin four smokers a duplicatediet study was conducted along with a kinetic study of plasma cadmium versus bcdfemale smokers had a mean bcd of 121ng cdml with a nearly 10fold range 029274ng cdml nonsmokers had a lower mean bcd 035ng cdml p  005 and narrower range 020061ng cdmlmeans and ranges for males were similarestimates of cadmium amounts inhaled daily for our subjects smoking  20 cigarettesday were far less than the 15 Âµg cd reported to be ingested daily via dietthis icd amount was too low to alone explain the 35fold elevation of bcd in our smokers even assuming greater cadmium absorption via lungs than gastrointestinal tract cadmium accumulated in smokers lungs may provide the added cadmiumfinally bcd appeared to be linearly related to icd values in 75 of smokers whereas 25 had far higher bcd implying a possible heterogeneity among smokers regarding circulating cadmium concentrations and potentially cadmium toxicity
