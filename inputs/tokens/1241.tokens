background chronic dietary cadmium cd exposure results in kidney dysfunction and decrease in bone mineral densityobjective to determine and compare the bioavailability of cd from vegetable and animalbased foodsmaterial and method caco2 cells were exposed to cd in boiled pig kidney ark shell kale raw kale mixed boiled pig kidney with raw kale and cdcl2 after in vitro digestionthen cellular cd uptake from the digests and reference cdcl2 solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrometryresults cd bioavailability from animalbased foods was higher than that from vegetablebased foodsin addition raw kale exhibited an inhibitory effect on cd bioavailability when mixed with boiled pig kidneyhowever cd in kale was increasingly absorbed after boilingconclusion cd binding to different molecular species other food components in vegetable and animalbased foods food combination as well as cooking processes influenced the uptake of dietary cda relative bioavailability factor accounted for the food matrix might be necessary for exposure assessment and consequently for estimation and prevention of the risk of dietary cd
