background exposure to overthecounter otc ibuprofen and other otc nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids is substantialalthough the literature on gastrointestinal gi safety of nsaid therapy is extensive the risk profiles of otc and prescription dosing are seldom separated and few studies provide risks specific to otc ibuprofenobjective to conduct a literature review to evaluate the risk of gi bleeding events related to otc ibuprofen usemethods published clinical trials observational studies and metaanalyses of otc ibuprofen use defined as up to 1200â€‰mgday or stated as over the counter reporting endpoints of incidence rates and proportions of gi bleeding events eg gi bleedingrelated hospitalizations and deaths were identified via medline through 2010data from these studies were summarizedresults twenty studies nine observational ten clinical trials one metaanalysis reporting incidence rates and proportions of a gi bleedingrelated event associated with otc or otcspecific doses of ibuprofen were includedthe frequency of a girelated hospitalization was 02 for patients on otccomparable dosesincidence rates among those using otccomparable doses ranged from 0 to 319 per 1000 patientyearsthe incidence of a gi bleedingrelated event increased with age and the use of concomitant medications and there was a general though not always statistically significant ibuprofen doseresponse relationshipthe relative risk of any gi bleedingrelated event ranged from 11 to 24 for users of otcspecific doses of ibuprofen compared to nonusersconclusions studies reported low incidence of gi bleeding events with use of otc ibuprofenfew published studies that specifically investigated otc ibuprofen use were identifiedvarying methodologies and definitions of exposure and outcomes prevented direct comparison of many resultsonly studies that used the methods herein described were identifiedfurther research evaluating the risk of gi bleeding events in patients taking otcspecific ibuprofen use may be useful
