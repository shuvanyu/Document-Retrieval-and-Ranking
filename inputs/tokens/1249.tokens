to assess the physiologic effects of cherry consumption we measured plasma urate antioxidant and inflammatory markers in 10 healthy women who consumed bing sweet cherriesthe women age 2240 y consumed two servings 280 g of cherries after an overnight fastblood and urine samples were taken before the cherry dose and at 15 3 and 5 h postdoseplasma urate decreased 5 h postdose mean  sem  183  15 micro moll compared with predose baseline of 214  13 micro moll p  005urinary urate increased postdose with peak excretion of 350  33 micro molmmol creatinine 3 h postdose compared with 202  13 at baseline p  001plasma creactive protein crp and nitric oxide no concentrations had decreased marginally 3 h postdose p  01 whereas plasma albumin and tumor necrosis factoralpha were unchangedthe vitamin c content of the cherries was solely as dehydroascorbic acid but postdose increases in plasma ascorbic acid indicated that dehydroascorbic acid in fruits is bioavailable as vitamin c the decrease in plasma urate after cherry consumption supports the reputed antigout efficacy of cherriesthe trend toward decreased inflammatory indices crp and no adds to the in vitro evidence that compounds in cherries may inhibit inflammatory pathways
