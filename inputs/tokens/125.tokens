the effects of different polyphenolcontaining beverages on fe absorption from a bread meal were estimated in adult human subjects from the erythrocyte incorporation of radiofethe test beverages contained different polyphenol structures and were rich in either phenolic acids chlorogenic acid in coffee monomeric flavonoids herb teas camomile matricaria recutita l vervain verbena officinalis l lime flower tilia cordata mill pennyroyal mentha pulegium l and peppermint mentha piperita l or complex polyphenol polymerization products black tea and cocoaall beverages were potent inhibitors of fe absorption and reduced absorption in a dosedependent fashion depending on the content of total polyphenolscompared with a water control meal beverages containing 2050 mg total polyphenolsserving reduced fe absorption from the bread meal by 5070 whereas beverages containing 100400 mg total polyphenolsserving reduced fe absorption by 6090inhibition by black tea was 7994 peppermint tea 84 pennyroyal 73 cocoa 71 vervain 59 lime flower 52 and camomile 47at an identical concentration of total polyphenols black tea was more inhibitory than cocoa and more inhibitory than herb teas camomile vervain lime flower and pennyroyal but was of equal inhibition to peppermint teaadding milk to coffee and tea had little or no influence on their inhibitory natureour findings demonstrate that herb teas as well as black tea coffee and coca can be potent inhibitors of fe absorptionthis property should be considered when giving dietary advice in relation to fe nutrition
