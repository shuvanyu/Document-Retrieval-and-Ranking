objective to examine and quantify the relation between purine intake and the risk of recurrent gout attacks among gout patientsmethods the authors conducted a casecrossover study to examine associations of a set of putative risk factors with recurrent gout attacksindividuals with gout were prospectively recruited and followed online for 1 yearparticipants were asked about the following information when experiencing a gout attack the onset date of the gout attack clinical symptoms and signs medications including antigout medications and presence of potential risk factors including daily intake of various purinecontaining food items during the 2day period prior to the gout attackthe same exposure information was also assessed over 2day control periodsresults this study included 633 participants with goutcompared with the lowest quintile of total purine intake over a 2day period or of recurrent gout attacks were 117 138 221 and 476 respectively with each increasing quintile p for trend 0001the corresponding or were 142 134 177 and 241 for increasing quintiles of purine intake from animal sources p for trend 0001 and 112 099 132 and 139 from plant sources p004 respectivelythe effect of purine intake persisted across subgroups by sex use of alcohol diuretics allopurinol nsaids and colchicineconclusions the study findings suggest that acute purine intake increases the risk of recurrent gout attacks by almost fivefold among gout patientsavoiding or reducing amount of purinerich foods intake especially of animal origin may help reduce the risk of gout attacks
