cox1 and cox2 are two cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for prostanoid productioncox2 is expressed in inflammatory cells and fibroblasts of the gastric mucosa and through the production of various growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor hgf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf plays a key role in the tissue repair processaspirin induces and acetylates cox2 to produce 15repilipoxina4 an antiinflammatory mediator thought to protect the gastric mucosa against aspirininduced injuryrecently three different pge synthases have been identified that convert cox2 metabolites into pge2mpge synthase mpges1 has been shown to be inducible and to colocalize with cox2 in fibroblasts and macrophages infiltrating the gastric ulcer bedcpges and mpges2 have been found expressed in normal gastric mucosa with no change in expression levels seen in gastritis or gastric ulcer tissuefinally this review discusses the role of these enzymes in the pathophysiology of the gastric mucosa as well as the biologcal significance of their inhibition
