processing of fruits and vegetables affects their phytochemical and nutrient contenttart cherries are commercially promoted to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory activityhowever processing affects their phytochemical content and may affect their related health benefitsthe current study compares the in vitro antioxidant capacity and antiinflammatory cyclooxygenase activity of processed tart cherry prunus cerasus productscherry juice concentrate individually quickfrozen cherries canned cherries and dried cherriescherry products were analyzed for total anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin content and profileon a per serving basis total anthocyanins were highest in frozen cherries and total proanthocyanidins were highest in juice concentratetotal phenolics were highest in juice concentratejuice concentrate had the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac and peroxynitrite radical averting capacity noracdried cherries had the highest hydroxyl radical averting capacity horac and superoxide radical averting capacity soracprocessed tart cherry products compared very favorably to the us deptof agriculturereported orac of other fresh and processed fruitsinhibition of in vitro inflammatory cox1 activity was greatest in juice concentratein summary all processed tart cherry products possessed antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity but processing differentially affected phytochemical content and in vitro bioactivityon a per serving basis juice concentrate was superior to other tart cherry products 2012 institute of food technologists
