a complex system of interacting mediators exists in the gastric mucosa to strengthen its resistance against injuryin this system prostaglandins play an important roleprostaglandin biosynthesis is catalysed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase cox which exists in two isoforms cox1 and cox2initially the concept was developed that cox1 functions as housekeeping enzyme whereas cox2 yields prostaglandins involved in pathophysiological reactions such as inflammationin the gastrointestinal tract the maintenance of mucosal integrity was attributed exclusively to cox1 without a contribution of cox2 and ulcerogenic effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids were believed to be the consequence of inhibition of cox1recent findings however indicate that both cox1 and cox2 either alone or in concert contribute to gastric mucosal defencethus in normal rat gastric mucosa specific inhibition of cox1 does not elicit mucosal lesions despite nearmaximal suppression of gastric prostaglandin formationwhen a selective cox2 inhibitor which is not ulcerogenic when given alone is added to the cox1 inhibitor severe gastric damage developsin contrast to normal gastric mucosa which requires simultaneous inhibition of cox1 and cox2 for breakdown of mucosal resistance in the acidchallenged rat stomach inhibition of cox1 alone results in dosedependent injury which is further increased by additional inhibition of cox2 enzyme activity or prevention of acidinduced upregulation of cox2 expression by dexamethasonecox2 inhibitors do not damage the normal or acidchallenged gastric mucosa when given alonehowever when nitric oxide formation is suppressed or afferent nerves are defunctionalized specific inhibition of cox2 induces severe gastric damageischemiareperfusion of the gastric artery is associated with upregulation of cox2 but not cox1 mrnacox2 inhibitors or dexamethasone augment ischemiareperfusioninduced gastric damage up to fourfold an effect abolished by concurrent administration of 1616dimethylpge2selective inhibition of cox1 is less effectivefurthermore cox2 inhibitors antagonize the protective effect of a mild irritant or intragastric peptone perfusion in the rat stomach whereas the protection induced by chronic administration of endotoxin is mediated by cox1finally an important function of cox2 is the acceleration of ulcer healingcox2 is upregulated in chronic gastric ulcers and inhibitors of cox2 impair the healing of ulcers to the same extent as nonselective nsaidstaken together these observations show that both cox isoenzymes are essential factors in mucosal defence with specific contributions in various physiological and pathophysiological situations
