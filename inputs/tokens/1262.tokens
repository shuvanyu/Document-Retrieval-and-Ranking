background differences in nutrient profiles between vegetarian and non vegetarian dietary patterns reflect nutritional differences that may contribute to the development of diseaseobjective to compare nutrient intakes between dietary patterns characterized by consumption or exclusion of meat and dairy productsdesign crosssectional study of 71751 subjects mean age 59 years from the adventisthealthstudy2data was collected between 2002 and 2007participants completed a 204item validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnairedietary patterns compared were non vegetarian semi vegetarian pesco vegetarian lactoovo vegetarian and strict vegetarianancova was used to analyze differences in nutrient intakes by dietary patterns and were adjusted for age and sex and racebmi and other relevant demographic data were reported and compared by dietary pattern using chisquare tests and anovaresults many nutrient intakes varied significantly between dietary patternsnon vegetarians had the lowest intakes of plant proteins fiber Î²carotene and mg than those following vegetarian dietary patterns and the highest intakes of saturated trans arachidonic and docosahexaenoic fatty acidsthe lower tails of some nutrient distributions in strict vegetarians suggested inadequate intakes by a portion of the subjectsenergy intake was similar among dietary patterns at close to 2000 kcald with the exception of semi vegetarians that had an intake of 1713 kcaldmean bmi was highest in nonvegetarians mean standard deviation sd 287 64 and lowest in strict vegetarians 240 48conclusions nutrient profiles varied markedly between dietary patterns that were defined by meat and dairy intakesthese differences can be of interest in the etiology of obesity and chronic diseases
