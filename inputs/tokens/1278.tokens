background few studies have evaluated the linkage between food cost and mortality among older adultsthis study considers the hypothesis that greater food expenditure in general and particularly on more nutritious plant and animalderived foods decreases mortality in older adultsmethods this study uses the 19992000 elderly nutrition and health survey in taiwan and follows the cohort until 2008 collecting 24hr dietary recall data for 1781 participants 874 men and 907 women aged 65 y or olderusing monthly mean national food prices and 24hr recall this study presents an estimate of daily expenditures for vegetable fruit animalderived and grain food categoriesparticipants were linked to the national death registryresults of the 1781 original participants 625 died during the 10y followup periodamong the 4 food categories the fourth and fifth expenditure quintiles for vegetables and for fruits had the highest survival ratesafter adjusting for covariates higher q4 vegetable and higher fruit q4 food expenditures referent to q1 were significantly predictive of reduced mortality hr  055 95 ci 039078 and hr  064 95 ci 042099 respectively and the risk decreased by 12 and 10 for every nt15 us050 increase in their daily expendituresanimalderived and grain food spending was not predictive of mortalityconclusion greater and more achievable vegetable and fruit affordability may improve food security and longevity for older adults
