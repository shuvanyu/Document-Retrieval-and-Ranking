background similar to the general population in taiwan the health of aborigines has steadily improved over the last 30 years but the gap remains wide especially in males despite an infusion of substantial medical resourcesthe objectives of this study are to quantify the contribution of major causes of death to the gap in life expectancy and to propose initiatives to bridge the health gap between aborigines and the general populationmethods this study included residents slightly over 200000 from 30 aboriginal townships in taiwanthe gap in life expectancy between aborigines and the general population was analysed by decomposing these gaps according to major causes of deathsthis analysis quantifies the contribution of different causes of deaths to the gap in life expectancy between the two populationsresults the overall mortality of aborigines in these townships was approximately 70 higher than the respective male and female general populations over the past 30 yearsmortality from infectious disease cirrhosis of the liver accidents and suicide are substantially higher than the general populationthe gap in life expectancy at birth in males was 85 years during 19711973 increasing to 135 years by 19982000 however the gap in females remained relatively stable 80 years and 84 years respectivelyof the 135year difference in life expectancy in males the differential mortality from diseases of the digestive system mainly due to cirrhosis of the liver accidents from both motor vehicle and nonmotor vehicle accidents and infectious and parasitic disease contributed half 50 of the gap in life expectancyin females the above primarily preventable causes of deaths accounted for 41 of the life expectancy gapconclusions based on the findings of this study we suggest that future focus should be in the area of primary prevention in order to reduce the incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases liver cirrhosis and accidents
