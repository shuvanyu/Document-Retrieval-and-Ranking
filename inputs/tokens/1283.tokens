background the word selectivity describes a drugs ability to affect a particular cell population in preference to othersas part of the current state of art in the search for new therapeutic agents the property of selectivity is a mode of action thought to have a high degree of desirabilityconsequently there is a growing activity in this area of researchselectivity is generally a worthy property in a drug because a drug having high selectivity may have a dramatic effect when there is a single agent that can be targeted against the appropriate moleculardriver involved in the pathogenesis of a diseasean example is chronic myeloid leukemia cmlcml has a specific chromosomal abnormality the philadelphia chromosome that results in a single gene that produces an abnormal protein discussion there is a burgeoning understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control the etiology and pathogeneses of diseasesthis understanding both enables and motivates the development of drugs that induce a specific action in a selected cell population ie a targeted treatmentconsequently drugs that can target distinct molecular targets involved in pathologicpathogenetic processes or signaltransduction pathways are being developedhowever in most cases diseases involve multiple abnormalitiesa disease may be associated with more than one dysfunctional protein and these may be outofbalance with each otherlikewise a drug might strongly target a protein that shares a similar active domain with other proteinsa drug may also target pleiotropic cytokines or other proteins that have multiphysiological functionsin this way multiple normal cellular pathways can be simultaneously influencedlong term experience with drugs supposedly designed for only a single target but which unavoidably involve other functional effects is uncovering the fact that molecular targeting is not medically flawlesssummary we contend that an ideal drug may be one whose efficacy is based not on the inhibition of a single target but rather on the rebalancing of the several proteins or events that contribute to the etiology pathogeneses and progression of diseases ie in effect a promiscuous drugideally if this could be done at minimum drug concentration side effects could be minimizedcorollaries to this argument are that the growing fervor for researching truly selective drugs may be imprudent when considering the totality of responses and that the expensive screening techniques used to discover these may be both medically and financially inefficient
