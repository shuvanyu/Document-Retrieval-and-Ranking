restriction of food intake by 1050 of ad libitum on a per unit of weight or energy content basis can extend the lifespan of a wide variety of species and prevent or delay agerelated diseasethis review first briefly summarizes the data delineating mortality trajectories of various species populations maintained on restricted diets to provide insight into the effects of nutrient deprivation on distinct components of the aging processnext i discuss a number of important studies that have addressed the question whether it is the lack of calories andor specific nutrients that determines the longevity response to dietary restrictionfinally i review the evidence for hormesis as a proximate mechanism underpinning the impact of dietary restriction on lifespanin aggregate the currently available demographic data suggest that dietary restriction can both slow the agerelated progressive accumulation of cellular damage and also enhance the ability of organisms to cope with irreversible injuryrestriction of essential nutrients as well as calories may affect life expectancy perhaps in a species specific fashionhormesis iean evolutionary conserved stress response routine providing protection against a wide variety of other hazards in response to low levels of stress is very likely to contribute to the beneficial health effects of dietary restrictioncopyright Ã¢ 2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
