hormesis is a term used by toxicologists to refer to a biphasic dose response to an environmental agent characterized by a low dose stimulation or beneficial effect and a high dose inhibitory or toxic effectin the fields of biology and medicine hormesis is defined as an adaptive response of cells and organisms to a moderate usually intermittent stressexamples include ischemic preconditioning exercise dietary energy restriction and exposures to low doses of certain phytochemicalsrecent findings have elucidated the cellular signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that mediate hormetic responses which typically involve enzymes such as kinases and deacetylases and transcription factors such as nrf2 and nfÎºbas a result cells increase their production of cytoprotective and restorative proteins including growth factors phase 2 and antioxidant enzymes and protein chaperonesa better understanding of hormesis mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels is leading to and to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of many different diseases
