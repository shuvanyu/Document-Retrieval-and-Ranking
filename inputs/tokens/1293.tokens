until recently the study and understanding of plant and animal signalling and response mechanisms have developed independentlyrecent biochemical and molecular work is producing a growing list of elements involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli that are very similar across kingdomssome of the more interesting examples of these include prostaglandinoctadecanoidmediated responses to wounding steroidbased signalling systems and pathogenrecognition mechanismssome of these similarities probably represent evolutionary convergence others may be ancestral to plants and animalsecological and evolutionary implications of such overlaps include the existence of pathogens that can cause disease in plants and animals the ability of herbivores to manipulate plant responses usurpation of microbial mechanisms and genes by herbivorous animals and plants evolution of plant defenses exploiting shared signals in animals and the medicinal use of plants by humanscomparative study of the signalling and response mechanisms used by plants animals and microbes provides novel and useful insights to the ecology and evolution of interactions across kingdoms
