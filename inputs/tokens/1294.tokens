xenohormesis is a biological principle that explains how environmentally stressed plants produce bioactive compounds that can confer stress resistance and survival benefits to animals that consume themanimals can piggyback off products of plants sophisticated stress response which has evolved as a result of their stationary lifestylefactors eliciting the plant stress response can judiciously be employed to maximize yield of healthpromoting plant compoundsthe xenohormetic plant compounds can when ingested improve longevity and fitness by activating the animals cellular stress response and can be applied in drug discovery drug production and nutritional enhancement of diet
