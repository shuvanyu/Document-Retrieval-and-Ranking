background allergic reactions to food can be produced by contaminants that induce sensitizationamong these anisakis simplex can cause seafood infestation and allergic symptoms urticariaangioedema anaphylaxis and asthma can follow the eating or handling of affected fishalthough seafood is the principal source of human infections by this parasite we have found allergic symptoms in 8 patients previously diagnosed as having a simplex sensitization after they ate chicken meatchicken feed usually has a high proportion of fishmeal which might possibly be contaminated by this nematodeobjective the aim of our study was to determine whether parasite proteins present in chicken meat could be responsible for the symptoms reported by these subjectsmethods we carried out in vivo tests prick bronchial challenge and doubleblind placebocontrolled challenge with meat chicken in these 8 patientswe performed immunoblotting using the sera from the 8 patients and controls in order to detect a simplex sensitizationwe also investigated the presence of a simplex proteins in sera from chickens fed with fishmeal and in other sera from chickens fed only with cerealswe excluded sensitization to other chicken nematodes by serologic methodsresults all 8 patients presented positive prick and challenges to a simplexwhen we used serum from chickens fed with fishmeal as the antigen in blotting patients 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 recognized a band of 16 kd also obtained when using pools of fishshellfish and a simplex larvano detection was observed with sera from chickens fed with only cerealsconclusion we provide evidence based on in vivo and in vitro tests that subjects highly sensitized to a simplex can detect the presence of anisakis species allergens in chicken meat
