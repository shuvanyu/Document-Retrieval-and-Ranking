the cytotoxicity of extracts from a widely used species of plant moringa stenopetala was assessed in hepg2 cells by measuring the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and cell viabilitythe functional integrity of extractexposed cells was determined by measuring intracellular levels of atp and glutathione gshthe ethanol extracts of leaves and seeds increased significantly p  001 ldh leakage in a dose and timedependent mannerthe water extract of leaves and the ethanol extract of the root did not increase ldh leakagea highly significant p  0001 decrease in hepg2 viability was found after incubating the cells with the highest concentration 500 microgml of the ethanol leaf and seed extractsat a concentration of 500 microgml the water extract of leaves increased p  001 while the ethanol extract of the same plant part decreased p  001 atp levelsthe root and seed extracts had no significant effect on atp levelsthe ethanol leaf extract decreased gsh levels at a concentration of 500 microgml p  001 as did the ethanol extract of the seeds at 250 microgml and 500 microgml p  005the water extract of the leaves did not alter gsh or ldh levels or affect cell viability suggesting that it may be nontoxic and is consistent with its use as a vegetablethe data obtained from the studies with the ethanol extract of the leaves and seeds from moringa stenopetala show that they contain toxic substances that are extractable with organic solvents or are formed during the process of extraction with these solventsthe significant depletion of atp and gsh only occurred at concentrations of extract that caused leakage of ldhfurther investigation with this plant in order to identify the constituents extracted and their individual toxic effects both in vivo and in vitro is warrantedthis study also illustrates the utility of cell culture for screening plant extracts for potential toxicitycopyright c 2005 john wiley  sons ltd
