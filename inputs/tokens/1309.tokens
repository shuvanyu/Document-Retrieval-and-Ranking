background carbohydratespecific ige antibodies present on nonprimate mammalian proteins were incriminated recently in delayed meat anaphylaxisthe aim of this study was to explore whether anaphylaxis to mammalian kidney is also associated with galactoseα13galactose αgalspecific igemethods fourteen patients with anaphylaxis to pork or beef kidney underwent prick tests to meat and kidneysome patients also underwent skin tests to erbitux cetuximabige antibodies to αgal swine urine proteins beef and pork meat serum albumin proteins cat and rfel d 1 were measured by immunocapthe αgal levels were estimated in meats and kidney by elisa inhibition assaycrossreactivity between αgal and pork kidney was studied with the immunocap inhibition assayresults among the 14 patients 12 presented with anaphylactic shockreactions occurred within 2 h from exposure in 67 of patientsassociated risk factors were observed in 10 cases and alcohol was the main cofactorthree patients underwent an oral challenge to pork kidney and anaphylaxis occurred after ingestion of small quantities 12 gprick tests to kidney were positive in 54 of patientsall tested patients showed positive skin tests to erbituxall patients tested positive for ige to αgal with levels ranging from 04 to 294 kulige binding to αgal was inhibited by raw pork kidney extract mean 77 range 5587 which showed a high amount of αgal determinantsconclusions pork or beef kidney anaphylaxis is related to αgal igeits peculiar severity could be due to an elevated content of αgal epitopes in kidney 2012 john wiley  sons as
