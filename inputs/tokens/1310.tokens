summary antigal is the most abundant natural antibody in humans constituting  1 of immunoglobulinsantigal is naturally produced also in apes and old world monkeysthe ligand of antigal is a carbohydrate antigen called the αgal epitope with the structure galα13galβ14glcnacrthe αgal epitope is present as a major carbohydrate antigen in nonprimate mammals prosimians and new world monkeysantigal can contributes to several immunological pathogenesesantigal ige produced in some individuals causes allergies to meat and to the therapeutic monoclonal antibody cetuximab all presenting αgal epitopesaberrant expression of the αgal epitope or of antigens mimicking it in humans may result in autoimmune processes as in graves diseaseαgal epitopes produced by trypanosoma cruzi interact with antigal and induce autoimmune like inflammatory reactions in chagas diseaseantigal igm and igg further mediate rejection of xenografts expressing αgal epitopesbecause of its abundance antigal may be exploited for various clinical usesit increases immunogenicity of microbial vaccines eginfluenza vaccine presenting αgal epitopes by targeting them for effective uptake by antigenpresenting cellstumour lesions are converted into vaccines against autologous tumourassociated antigens by intratumoral injection of αgal glycolipids which insert into tumour cell membranesantigal binding to αgal epitopes on tumour cells targets them for uptake by antigenpresenting cellsaccelerated wound healing is achieved by application of αgal nanoparticles which bind antigal activate complement and recruit and activate macrophages that induce tissue regenerationthis therapy may be of further significance in regeneration of internally injured tissues such as ischaemic myocardium and injured nerves
