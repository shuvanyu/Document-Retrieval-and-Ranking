anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be rapidly progressing and fatalin instances where the triggering allergen is not known establishing the etiology of anaphylaxis is pivotal to longterm risk managementour recent work has identified a novel ige antibody ab response to a mammalian oligosaccharide epitope galactosealpha13galactose alphagal that has been associated with two distinct forms of anaphylaxis 1 immediate onset anaphylaxis during first exposure to intravenous cetuximab and 2 delayed onset anaphylaxis 36 h after ingestion of mammalian food products eg beef and porkthe results of our studies strongly suggest that tick bites are a cause if not the only significant cause of ige ab responses to alphagal in the southern eastern and central united statespatients with ige ab to alphagal continue to emerge and increasingly these cases involve childrenthis ige ab response crossreacts with cat and dog but does not appear to pose a risk for asthma however it may impair diagnostic testing in some situations
