patients with cancer have circulating heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal red cells via recognition of the mammalian cell surface sialic acid nglycolylneuraminic acid neu5gc which was long considered an oncofetal antigen in humanshowever humans are genetically deficient in neu5gc production and instead metabolically accumulate neu5gc from dietary sources particularly red meats and milk productsmoreover mice with a humanlike defect showed no alternate pathway for neu5gc synthesis and even normal humans express antineu5gc antibodieswe show here that human tumors accumulate neu5gc that is covalently attached to multiple classes of glycansthe paradox of human tumor neu5gc accumulation in the face of circulating antineu5gc antibodies was hypothesized to be due to facilitation of tumor progression by the resulting lowgrade chronic inflammationindeed murine tumors expressing humanlike levels of neu5gc show accelerated growth in syngeneic mice with a humanlike neu5gc deficiency coincident with the induction of antineu5gc antibodies and increased infiltration of inflammatory cellstransfer of polyclonal monospecific syngeneic mouse antineu5gc serum also enhanced growth of transplanted syngeneic tumors bearing humanlike levels of neu5gc with tumors showing evidence for antibody deposition enhanced angiogenesis and chronic inflammationthese effects were suppressed by a cyclooxygenase2 inhibitor a drug type known to reduce human carcinoma riskfinally affinitypurified human antineu5gc antibodies also accelerate growth of neu5gccontaining tumors in neu5gcdeficient micetaken together the data suggest that the human propensity to develop dietrelated carcinomas is contributed to by local chronic inflammation resulting from interaction of metabolicallyaccumulated dietary neu5gc with circulating antineu5gc antibodies
