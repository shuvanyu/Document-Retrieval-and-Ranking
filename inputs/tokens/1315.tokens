introduction alphagal is a glycoconjugate present on cell membranes of mammals and bacteria but not humans who display antigal antibodies ab in high titers provoked by the commensal gut florain the present study we sought to determine the longitudinal course of alphagal specific ab titers of all isotypes over 8 weeks among healthy adult subjectsfurthermore we hypothesized that inflammatory bowel disease ibd patients display increased antigal titersmaterials and methods we drew serum from healthy probands n20 weekly for 8 weeks and obtained plasma samples of from patients suffering from crohns disease n20 and ulcerative colitis n20we measured antigal abs of all isotypes and total immunoglobulin ig content using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay techniquefor statistical evaluation of the longitudinal titers we calculated confidence intervals for the slopes of a random intercept model comparing variances between and within the probandsfor group comparisons we performed paired student ttests and pearson correlationsresults alphagal specific igg igm igd and iga titers remained unvaried within a narrow range upon longitudinal observationmost probands did not display alphagal specific ige abscrohns disease patients showed highly increased alphagalspecific iga titers compared with control subjects p01conclusion apart from ige alphagalspecific abs of all isotypes remained constant over longer time periods in healthy subjectsthus significant titer changes actually represent increased antigen exposure and a specific antialphagal responsecrohns disease patients display increased antigal iga titers compared with healthy controls which reflects a chronically impaired mucosal gut barrier in this patient cohortcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
