we have previously shown that an antibody pool present in normal human serum binds cytokine receptors in vitro and may therefore interfere with assays that capture cytokines using their receptorshere we show that this antibody pool is the same as the natural antibody termed antigal that binds to the alphagalactosyl carbohydrate epitope alphagal and which is the predominant obstacle to xenotransplantationwe report that there are high levels of igd anti alphagal in most volunteers in addition to the igg2 iga and igm immunoglobulin isotypes against alphagal previously describedto determine if antigal may interfere with assays that depend on capture of cytokine with its receptor we measured levels of several anticarbohydrate antibodies in a cohort of patients with advanced atherosclerosis that had previously been used to measure levels of active tgfbeta using such an assayfor many isotype  carbohydrate combinations there is a large and significant difference between the levels of anticarbohydrate antibodies in patients with atherosclerosis and controls after adjustment for age sex and blood groupthese results are similar to the previous data obtained for active tgfbeta and therefore we cannot discount the possibility that antigal contributed to the previous datafollowing further adjustment for several risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease several anticarbohydrate antibodies were still significantly different between patients and controlstherefore anticarbohydrate antibodies may represent a new class of risk factors that may be associated with presence of advanced atherosclerosis although larger studies will be required to confirm this hypothesis
