we have recently demonstrated that both antibodies to gal alpha13gal and the gal alpha13gal binding lectin ib4 bind a synthetic peptide dahweswl there being a similar recognition of carbohydrate and peptide structureswe now report that the antigal alpha13gal antibodies and ib4 lectin also react with peptides encoded by mucin genes muc 1 3 4sequences known to be rich in serine threonine and prolinethis activity was demonstrated 1 by the ability of mucin derived peptides to block the reaction of antigal alpha13gal antibodies and ib4 lectin with a gal alpha13gal pig endothelial cell line the reactions were specific and did not occur with a random peptide containing the same sequences or with other mucin peptides 2 by the fact that antimucin1 antibodies could react with the gal alpha13gal expressed after transfection of cos cells gal alpha13galmuc1 with cdna encoding the pig alpha 3galactosyltransferase and 3 that the ib4 lectin and antigal alpha13gal antibodies could react with mucin 1 found on the surface of human breast cancer cellsthus natural occurring antigal alpha13gal antibodies found in all human serum can react with self muc1 peptides expressed in large amounts on the surface of tumour cells but not on normal cellsthe findings are of interest and serve to explain the previously reported findings that human cells can at times express gal alpha13gal such expression is an artefact the reaction is due to the phenomenon described herein iethat antigal alpha13gal antibodies react with mucin peptides
