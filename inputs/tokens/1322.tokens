glycoconjugates and their antibodies are vital components of hosttumor interactionthis review concentrates on the oncological implications of research concerning the alpha gal triad the alpha 13 galactosyl epitope alpha gal the enzyme responsible for its construction alpha 13 galactosyl transferase alpha 13gt and its associated antibody antigalalpha gal epitopes previously assumed to be absent from human tissue have been demonstrated on several human cancer cell lines senescent red blood cells and graves disease thyrocytesalphagal presence on neoplastic lines is correlated with increased metastatic formation in animal modelsthe mechanisms of human response to these neoantigens are complex as natural antigal antibodies exist in high titers in normal sera thus predicting immunological recognition of cells expressing alpha gal epitopeshypotheses vary regarding the pathogenic contributions of metastasisassociated phenomena such as de novo expression of alpha gal and its unmasking by desialylationthe means by which alpha gal is sporadically expressed in human tissue remain unknown as the galactosyl transferase which produces this epitope in constitutively expressive animals has undergone significant mutation at the genomic level in humanspathological reexpression is presumed to require permissive changes at a cellular leveldetailing these alterations is a prerequisite to the comprehension of the metastatic phenotypein this context the possibility of therapeutic strategies affecting alpha gal expression are also discussed
