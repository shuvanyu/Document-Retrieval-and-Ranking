background microparticles mps with procoagulant activity are present in human atherosclerosis but no detailed information is available on their compositionmethods and results to obtain insights into the role of mps in atherogenesis mp proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry metabolite profiles were determined by highresolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and antibody reactivity was assessed against combinatorial antigen librariesplaque mps expressed surface antigens consistent with their leukocyte origin including major histocompatibility complex classes i and ii and induced a dosedependent stimulatory effect on tcell proliferationnotably taurine the most abundant free organic acid in human neutrophils which scavenges myeloperoxidasecatalyzed free radicals was highly enriched in plaque mpsmoreover fluorescent labeling of proteins on the mp surface suggested immunoglobulins to be trapped inside which was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis on permeabilized and nonpermeabilized plaque mpscolabeling for cd14 and igg established that more than 90 of the igg containing mps were cd14 indicating a macrophage originscreening against an antigen library revealed that the immunologic profiles of antibodies in mps were similar to those found in plaques but differed profoundly from antibodies in plasma and unexpectedly showed strong reactions with oligosaccharide antigens in particular blood group antigen aconclusions this study provides the first evidence that immunoglobulins are present within mps derived from plaque macrophages that the portfolio of plaque antibodies is different from circulating antibodies in plasma and that anticarbohydrate antibodies are retained in human atherosclerotic lesions
