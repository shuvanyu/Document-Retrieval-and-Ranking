background because of egg cholesterol content reduction in egg consumption is generally recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular diseaserecently however evidence has been accumulating to suggest that dietary cholesterol is less relevant to cardiovascular risk than dietary saturated fatthis randomized controlled crossover trial was conducted to determine the effects of egg ingestion on endothelial function a reliable index of cardiovascular riskmethods fortynine healthy adults mean age 56 years 40 females underwent a baseline brachial artery reactivity study bars and were assigned to two eggs or oats daily for 6 weeks in random sequence with a 4week washouta bars was done at the end of each treatment phase measuring flowmediated vasodilation fmd in the brachial artery using a highfrequency ultrasoundresults fmd was stable in both egg and oat groups and betweentreatment differences were not significant egg 096 oatmeal 079 p value 005six weeks of egg ingestion had no effect on total cholesterol baseline 2038 mgdl posttreatment 2053 or ldl baseline 1248 mgdl posttreatment 1291in contrast 6 weeks of oats lowered total cholesterol to 194 mgdl p  00017 and ldl to 1166 mgdl p  0012there were no differences in body mass index bmi triglyceride hdl or sbp levels between egg and oat treatment assignmentsconclusion shortterm egg consumption does not adversely affect endothelial function in healthy adults supporting the view that dietary cholesterol may be less detrimental to cardiovascular health than previously thought
