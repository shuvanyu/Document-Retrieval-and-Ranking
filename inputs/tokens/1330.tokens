endothelial dysfunction is considered an important prognostic factor in atherosclerosisto determine the longterm association of brachial artery flowmediated dilation fmd and adverse cardiovascular cv events in healthy subjects we prospectively assessed brachial fmd in 618 consecutive healthy subjects with no apparent heart disease 387 men 63 and mean age 54  11 yearsafter overnight fasting and discontinuation of all medications for 12 hours fmd was assessed using highresolution linear array ultrasoundsubjects were divided into 2 groups fmd 113 n  309 and 113 n  309 where 113 is the median fmd and were comparable regarding cv risk factors lipoproteins fasting glucose creactive protein concomitant medications and framingham 10year risk scorein a mean clinical followup of 46  18 years the composite cv events allcause mortality nonfatal myocardial infarction hospitalization for heart failure or angina pectoris stroke coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary interventions were significantly more common in subjects with fmd 113 rather than 113 152 vs 12 p  00001 respectivelyunivariate analysis demonstrated that the median fmd significantly predicted cv events odds ratio 278 95 ci 135 to 571 p 0001multivariate analysis controlling for traditional cv risk factors demonstrated that median fmd was the best independent predictor of longterm cv adverse events odds ratio 293 95 ci 128 to 668 p 0001in conclusion brachial artery median fmd independently predicts longterm adverse cv events in healthy subjects with no apparent heart disease in addition to those derived from traditional risk factor assessmentcopyright  2014 elsevier inc all rights reserved
