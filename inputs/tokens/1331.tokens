background polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk although the mechanisms are incompletely understoodin a previous article we showed significant reductions in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and several markers of inflammation with increasing intake of alphalinolenic acid ala from walnuts and flaxobjective to examine effects of ala on cardiovascular responses to acute stress flowmediated dilation fmd of the brachial artery and blood concentrations of endothelin1 and argininevasopressin avpdesign using a randomized crossover study design cardiovascular responses to acute stress were assessed in 20 hypercholesterolemic subjects a subset of whom also underwent fmd testing n  12participants were fed an average american diet aad and 2 experimental diets that varied in the amount of ala and linoleic acid la that they containedthe aad provided 87 energy from pufa 77 la 08 alaon the la diet saturated fat was reduced and pufa from walnuts and walnut oil provided 164 of energy 126 la 36 alaon the ala diet walnuts walnut oil and flax oil provided 17 energy from pufa 105 la 65 alaresults the ala and la diets significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure 2 to 3 mm hg and total peripheral resistance 4 and this effect was evident at rest and during stress main effect of diet p  002fmd increased 34 on the diet containing additional ala avp also increased by 20 and endothelin1 was unchangedconclusions these results suggest novel mechanisms for the cardioprotective effects of walnuts and flax and further work is needed to identify the bioactives responsible for these effects
