objectives metabolic syndrome is a precursor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvdwalnut ingestion has been shown to reduce cvd risk indices in diabetesthis randomized controlled crossover trial was performed to investigate the effects of daily walnut consumption on endothelial function and other biomarkers of cardiac risk in a population of overweight individuals with visceral adipositymethods fortysix overweight adults average age 574 years 28 women 18 men with elevated waist circumference and 1 or more additional signs of metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to two 8week sequences of walnutenriched ad libitum diet and ad libitum diet without walnuts which were separated by a 4week washout periodthe primary outcome measure was the change in flowmediated vasodilation fmd of the brachial arterysecondary measures included serum lipid panel fasting glucose and insulin homeostasis model assessmentinsulin resistance values blood pressure and anthropometric measuresresults fmd improved significantly from baseline when subjects consumed a walnutenriched diet as compared with the control diet 14  24 versus 03  15 p  0019beneficial trends in systolic blood pressure reduction were seen and maintenance of the baseline anthropometric values was also observedother measures were unalteredconclusion daily ingestion of 56 g of walnuts improves endothelial function in overweight adults with visceral adipositythe addition of walnuts to the diet does not lead to weight gainfurther study of the potential role of walnut intake in diabetes and cvd prevention is warranted
