background tree nuts particularly almonds walnuts and pistachios have been shown to possess cardioprotective effectshowever there is little information on the effects of hazelnut consumption on cardiovascular risk markersmethods the antiatherogenic effect of hazelnut before and after consumption in hypercholesterolemic subjects was investigatedtwentyone hypercholesterolemic volunteers 18 men and 3 women were recruited in a double control sandwich model intervention study with a single group and three isoenergetic diet periodsthese were control diet i 4 weeks hazelnutenriched diet 4 weeks hazelnut contributing 1820 of the total daily energy intake and control diet period ii 4 weeksthe cardiovascular risk biomarkers such as endothelial function using flowmediated dilation fmd technique lowdensity lipoprotein ldl oxidation products and inflammatory markers such as highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp soluble intercellular adhesion molecule1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule1 svcam1 as well as lipids and lipoprotein levels were monitoredresults consumption of a hazelnutenriched diet significantly improved fmd 566 total cholesterol 78 triacylglycerol 73 ldlcholesterol 617 and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol 607 compared with the control diet i oxidizedldl hscrp and svcam1 levels were significantly lower in the group ingesting a hazelnutenriched diet compared with the control diets i and iimodest correlations between svcam1 and fmd and between svcam1 and hscrp were observed r  049 p  025 r  066 p  001 respectivelyconclusion hazelnutenriched diets may exert antiatherogenic effect by improving endothelial function preventing ldl oxidation and inflammatory markers in addition to their lipid and lipoproteinlowering effectsthese beneficial effects appeared to be reversible after 4 weeks on a hazelnutfree diettherefore hazelnut may be incorporated into daily diet without change in total caloric intake for sustained health benefitcopyright  2013 national lipid associationall rights reserved
