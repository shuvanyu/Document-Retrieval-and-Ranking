objective emerging in vitro and animal evidence suggests that methylmercury could increase type 2 diabetes but little evidence exists in humanswe aimed to prospectively determine associations of mercury exposure as assessed by biomarker measurement with incident diabetesresearch design and methods we used neutron activation analysis to measure toenail mercury an objective biomarker of methylmercury exposure in 9267 adults free of diabetes at baseline in two separate us prospective cohortsincident diabetes was identified from biennial questionnaires and confirmed by validated supplementary questionnaire using symptoms diagnostic tests and medical therapyassociations of mercury exposure with incident diabetes were assessed using cox proportional hazardsresults during mean  sd followup of 197  70 years 1010 new cases of diabetes were diagnosedthe 95th percentile of toenail mercury was 132 μgg in men and 076 μgg in women corresponding to exposures 35fold and 2fold higher than the us environmental protection agency reference dosein multivariable analyses toenail mercury concentrations were not associated with higher incidence of diabetes in women men or both cohorts combinedcomparing the highest to lowest quintile of exposure the hazard ratio 95 ci for incident diabetes was 086 066111 in women 069 042115 in men and 077 061098 in the combined cohortsfindings were similar when more extreme categories deciles of mercury were compared and in analyses stratified by fish or omega3 consumption bmi and ageconclusions these findings from two separate large prospective cohorts do not support adverse effects of methylmercury on development of diabetes in men or women at usual levels of exposure seen in these populations
