the kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation in amla phyllanthus emblica l as well as in pure ascorbic acid solutions at initial concentrations present in amla over a temperature range of 50120 degrees c steadystate temperature has been studiedthe ascorbic acid degradation followed firstorder reaction kinetics where the rate constant increased with an increase in temperaturethe temperature dependence of degradation was adequately modeled by the arrhenius equationthe activation energies were found to be 409 kcalmole for amla and 449 kcalmole for pure vitamin solutionthe degradation kinetics of ascorbic acid was also evaluated in normal open pan cooking pressurecooking and a newly developed and patented fuelefficient ecocooker unsteady state heating processa mathematical model was developed using the steadystate kinetic parameters obtained to predict the losses of ascorbic acid from the timetemperature data of the unsteady state heating processing methodthe results obtained indicate the ascorbic acid degradation is of a similar order of magnitude in all the methods of cooking
