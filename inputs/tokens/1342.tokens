objectives the objective of this article is to extend our previous studies of persistent organic pollutant pop contamination of us food by measuring perfluorinated compounds pfcs organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in composite food samplesthis study is part of a larger study reported in two articles the other of which reports levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecane brominated flame retardants in these composite foods schecter et al2010polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and hexabromocyclodecane hbcd in composite us food samples environ health perspect 118357362methods in this study we measured concentrations of 32 organochlorine pesticides 7 pcbs and 11 pfcs in composite samples of 31 different types of food 310 individual food samples purchased from supermarkets in dallas texas usa in 2009dietary intake of these chemicals was calculated for an average americanresults contamination varied greatly among chemical and food typesthe highest level of pesticide contamination was from the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt metabolite pp dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene which ranged from 0028 ngg wet weight ww in whole milk yogurt to 23 ngg ww in catfish filletswe found pcb congeners 28 52 101 118 138 153 and 180 primarily in fish with highest levels in salmon pcb153 12 ngg ww pcb138 093 ngg wwfor pfcs we detected perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in 17 of 31 samples ranging from 007 ngg in potatoes to 180 ngg in olive oilin terms of dietary intake ddt and ddt metabolites endosulfans aldrin pcbs and pfoa were consumed at the highest levelsconclusion despite product bans we found pops in us food and mixtures of these chemicals are consumed by the american public at varying levelsthis suggests the need to expand testing of food for chemical contaminants
