background one of the outcomes positively associated with dioxin exposure in humans is type 2 diabetesobjectives this study was conducted in order to find the molecular biological evidence for the diabetogenic action of dioxin in adipose samples from vietnam veteransmethods we obtained 313 adipose tissue samples both from vietnam veterans who were exposed to dioxin operation ranch hand and from comparison veterans who served in southeast asia with no record of dioxin exposurewe conducted quantitative reversetranscribed polymerase chain reaction studies on selected marker mrnas from these samplesresults we found the most sensitive and reliable molecular indicator of dioxininduced diabetes to be the ratio of mrna of glucose transporter 4 glut4 and nuclear transcription factor kappa b nfκb a marker of inflammationthis ratio showed significant correlations to serum dioxin residues and to fasting glucose among those in the ranch hand group and surprisingly even in the comparison group who have low levels of dioxin comparable to the general publicsuch a correlation in the comparison group was particularly significant among those with known risk factors such as obesity and family history of diabetesconclusions these results show that the glut4nfκb ratio is a reliable marker for the diabetogenic action of dioxin particularly at very low exposure levels that are not much higher than those found in the general public implying a need to address current exposure levels
