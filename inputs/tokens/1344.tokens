objective lowlevel exposure to some persistent organic pollutants pops has recently become a focus because of their possible link with the risk of diabetesresearch design and methods crosssectional associations of the serum concentrations of pops with diabetes prevalence were investigated in 2016 adult participants in the national health and nutrition examination survey 19992002six pops 224455hexachlorobiphenyl 1234678heptachlorodibenzopdioxin 12346789octachlorodibenzopdioxin oxychlordane ppdichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and transnonachlor were selected because they were detectable in or80 of participantsresults compared with subjects with serum concentrations below the limit of detection after adjustment for age sex race and ethnicity poverty income ratio bmi and waist circumference diabetes prevalence was strongly positively associated with lipidadjusted serum concentrations of all six popswhen the participants were classified according to the sum of category numbers of the six pops adjusted odds ratios were 10 140 147 383 and 377 p for trend  0001the association was consistent in stratified analyses and stronger in younger participants mexican americans and obese individualsconclusions there were striking doseresponse relations between serum concentrations of six selected pops and the prevalence of diabetesthe strong graded association could offer a compelling challenge to future epidemiologic and toxicological research
