background studies have demonstrated ubiquitous human exposure to persistent organic pollutants pops such as ppdiphenyldichloroethene dde and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbsalthough there is considerable evidence that pop exposures are associated with prevalent diabetes these studies do not establish causality because the crosssectional study design does not allow for assessment of temporality of the exposuredisease associationprospective studies however have been lackingobjectives this study was designed to determine whether pop body burdens are related to incidence of diabetes in a cohort of great lakes sport fish consumersmethods the cohort was established in the early 1990s and followed through 2005we tested serum for dde and pcb congeners and assessed diabetes diagnosis demographics and fish consumptionassociations of diabetes with exposures were examined prospectively in participants without diabetes in 19941995 followed through 2005annual percent changes in dde and pcb132153 from 1994 to 2005 were examined by diabetes statusresults dde exposure was associated with incident diabetesincident diabetes was not associated with monoortho pcb118 total pcbs or years of sport fish consumptionannual percent change in dde and pcb132153 did not differ significantly by diabetes statusconclusions this study demonstrates an association between dde exposure and incident diabetesthe findings of an association of dde with incident diabetes and the lack of effect of diabetes on annual percent change in pops do not support the hypothesis that associations of pops with diabetes are attributable to reverse causalityadditional studies should address the biological pathways by which dde could affect glucose homeostasis
