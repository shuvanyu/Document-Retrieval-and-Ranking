the early effects of 2378tetrachlorodibenzoparadioxin tcdd exposure in the population involved in the seveso italy incident in 1976 have been examined in numerous studieschloracne was the only effect linked with sufficient certainty to dioxin exposurethe possible longterm consequences were investigated with mortality and cancer incidence studiesmortality and morbidity findings during the 20year period following the accident showed increased risk from lymphoemopoietic neoplasm digestive system cancer rectum in males and biliary tract among females in particular and respiratory system cancer lung among malesin the incidence analyses also thyroid gland and pleura cancer appeared suggestively increasedsoft tissue sarcomas showed an increase in the largest yet least exposed exposure subcohortseveral hypotheses associating noncancer effects with dioxin exposure were corroborated by findings in the seveso population this was the case with cardiovascular effects possibly linked to both chemical exposure and stressful disaster experience endocrine effects diabetes among females and reproductive effects exposure of men to tcdd was linked to a lowered malefemale sex ratio in their offspringthe results of many seveso studies point to possible gender effects in accordance with animal modelsnotwithstanding the acknowledged study limitations lack of individual exposure markers short latency and small population size for certain cancer types results of previous experimental and epidemiological studies along with mechanistic knowledge on dioxin toxicity support the hypotheses that the observed excesses might be associated with dioxin exposurethe mortality and cancer incidence followup of the seveso cohort are continuing
