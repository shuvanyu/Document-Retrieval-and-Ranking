the raw form of garlic and some of its preparations are widely recognized as antiplatelet agents that may contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular diseaseherein we examined the invitro antiaggregatory activity ivaa of human blood platelets induced by extracts of garlic samples that were previously heated in the form of crushed versus uncrushed cloves using different cooking methods and intensitiesthe concentrations of allicin and pyruvate two predictors of antiplatelet strength were also monitoredovenheating at 200 degrees c or immersing in boiling water for 3 min or less did not affect the ability of garlic to inhibit platelet aggregation as compared to raw garlic whereas heating for 6 min completely suppressed ivaa in uncrushed but not in previously crushed samplesthe latter samples had reduced yet significant antiplatelet activityprolonged incubation more than 10 min at these temperatures completely suppressed ivaamicrowaved garlic had no effect on platelet aggregationhowever increasing the concentration of garlic juice in the aggregation reaction had a positive ivaa dose response in crushed but not in uncrushed microwaved samplesthe addition of raw garlic juice to microwaved uncrushed garlic restored a full complement of antiplatelet activity that was completely lost without the garlic additiongarlicinduced ivaa was always associated with allicin and pyruvate levelsour results suggest that 1 allicin and thiosulfinates are responsible for the ivaa response 2 crushing garlic before moderate cooking can reduce the loss of activity and 3 the partial loss of antithrombotic effect in crushedcooked garlic may be compensated by increasing the amount consumed
