background epidemiologic studies suggest that there may be an association between environmental exposure to persistent organic pollutants pops and diabetesobjective the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that residential proximity to popcontaminated waste sites result in increased rates of hospitalization for diabetesmethods we determined the number of hospitalized patients 2574 years of age diagnosed with diabetes in new york state exclusive of new york city for the years 19932000descriptive statistics and negative binomial regression were used to compare diabetes hospitalization rates in individuals who resided in zip codes containing or abutting hazardous waste sites containing pops pop sites zip codes containing hazardous waste sites but with wastes other than pops other sites and zip codes without any identified hazardous waste sites clean sitesresults compared with the hospitalization rates for diabetes in clean sites the rate ratios for diabetes discharges for people residing in pop sites and other sites after adjustment for potential confounders were 123 95 confidence interval ci 115132 and 125 95 ci 116134 respectivelyin a subset of pop sites along the hudson river where there is higher income less smoking better diet and more exercise the rate ratio was 136 95 ci 126147 compared to clean sitesconclusions after controlling for major confounders we found a statistically significant increase in the rate of hospitalization for diabetes among the population residing in the zip codes containing toxic waste sites
