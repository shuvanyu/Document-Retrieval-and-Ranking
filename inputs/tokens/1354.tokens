background prospective cohort studies in relation to the associations between n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa and risk of type 2 diabetes t2d were inconsistentdifferences in tissue n3 pufa compositions in subjects with and without t2d were also inconsistent in both cohort and casecontrol studieswe conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of prospective cohort studies to examine the associations of fish and n3 pufa intake with t2d riskthe differences in tissue n3 pufa compositions in subjects with and without t2d were investigated based on cohort and casecontrol studiesmethods and findings pubmed embase cochrane library china national knowledge infrastructure cnki and chinese vip database up to january 2012 was used to identify relevant studies and reference lists from retrieved studies were reviewedtwo authors independently extracted the datarandomeffects models were used to pool the summary relative risk rrtwentyfour studies including 24509 t2d patients and 545275 participants were identifiedfor cohort studies the summary rr of t2d for the highest vs lowest categories of total fish marine n3 pufa and alphalinolenic acid intake was 107 95 ci 091 125 107 95 ci 095 120 and 093 95 ci 081 107 respectivelysubgroup analyses indicated that summary rr highest vs lowest category of t2d for fish and marine n3 pufa intake was 089 95 ci 081 098 and 087 95 ci 079 096 for asian populations and 120 95 ci 101 144 and 116 95 ci 104 128 for western populationsasian subjects with t2d had significantly lower tissue compositions of c226n3 smd 143 95 ci 175 112 and total n3 pufa smd 141 95 ci 223 059 compared with those without t2dconclusion this systematic review and metaanalysis provides evidence that marine n3 pufa have beneficial effects on the prevention of t2d in asian populations
