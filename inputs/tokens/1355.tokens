background and aims previous research on the association between fish consumption and incident type 2 diabetes has been inconclusivein addition few studies have investigated how fish consumption may be related to the metabolic abnormalities underlying diabetestherefore we examined the association of fish consumption with measures of insulin sensitivity and betacell function in a multiethnic populationmethods and results we examined the crosssectional association between fish consumption and measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion in 951 nondiabetic participants in the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study irasfish consumption categorized as 2 vs 2 portionsweek was measured using a validated food frequency questionnaireinsulin sensitivity si and acute insulin response air were determined from frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testshigher fish consumption was independently associated with lower siadjusted air β013 025 0016 p003 comparing  2 vs 2 portionsweekfish consumption was positively associated with intact and split proinsulincpeptide ratios however these associations were confounded by ethnicity multivariableadjusted β0073 0014 016 for intact proinsulincpeptide ratio β0031 0065 013 for split proinsulincpeptide ratiowe also observed a significant positive association between fish consumption and fasting blood glucose multivariableadjusted β227 068 386 p0005we found no association between fish consumption and si multivariableadjusted β 0015 0083 0053 or fasting insulin multivariableadjusted β0016 0066 010conclusions fish consumption was not associated with measures of insulin sensitivity in the multiethnic iras cohorthowever higher fish consumption may be associated with pancreatic betacell dysfunction
