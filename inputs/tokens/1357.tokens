objective to determine the effects of fish oil supplementation on lipid levels and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetesresearch design and methods a comprehensive search of medline embase lilacs the cochrane clinical trials registry bibliographies of relevant papers and expert input updated through september 1998 was undertakenall randomized placebocontrolled trials were included in which fish oil supplementation was the only intervention in subjects with type 2 diabetesthree investigators performed data extraction and quality scoring independently with discrepancies resolved by consensuseighteen trials including 823 subjects followed for a mean of 12 weeks were includeddoses of fish oil used ranged from 3 to 18 gday the outcomes studied were glycemic control and lipid levelsresults metaanalysis of pooled data demonstrated a statistically significant effect of fish oil on lowering triglycerides 056 mmoll 95 ci 071 to 041 and raising ldl cholesterol 021 mmoll 002 to 041no statistically significant effect was observed for fasting glucosehba1c total cholesterol or hdl cholesterolthe triglyceridelowering effect and the elevation in ldl cholesterol were most marked in those trials that recruited hypertriglyceridemic subjects and used higher doses of fish oilheterogeneity was observed and explained by the recruitment of subjects with baseline hypertriglyceridemia in some studiesconclusions fish oil supplementation in type 2 diabetes lowers triglycerides raises ldl cholesterol and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic controltrials with hard clinical end points are needed
