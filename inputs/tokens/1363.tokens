acrylamide occurs in foods commonly consumed in diets worldwideit is formed from the reaction of reducing sugars eg glucose or fructose with the amino acid asparagine via the maillard reaction which occurs during heat processing of foods primarily those derived from plant origin such as potato and cereal products above 120c 248fthe majority of epidemiological studies concerning potential relationships between acrylamide consumption and different types of cancer have indicated no increased risk except with a few types that warrant further studyefforts to reduce the formation of acrylamide in food products have resulted in some successes but there is no common approach that works for all foodsreduction in some foods is probably not possiblethe results from a major toxicological study aqueous intake of acrylamide by rats and mice are in the process of being releasedthe status of current knowledge in these areas is reviewed
