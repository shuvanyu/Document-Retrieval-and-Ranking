human exposure to acrylamide aa through consumption of french fries and other foods has been recognized as a potential health concernhere we used a statistical nonlinear regression model based on the two most influential factors cooking temperature and time to estimate aa concentrations in french friesthe r2 of the predictive model is 083 suggesting the developed model was significant and validbased on french fry intake survey data conducted in this study and eight frying temperaturetime schemes which can produce tasty and visually appealing french fries the monte carlo simulation results showed that if aa concentration is higher than 168 ppb the estimated cancer risk for adolescents aged 1318 years in taichung city would be already higher than the target excess lifetime cancer risk elcr and that by taking into account this limited life span onlyin order to reduce the cancer risk associated with aa intake the aa levels in french fries might have to be reduced even further if the epidemiological observations are validour mathematical model can serve as basis for further investigations on elcr including different life stages and behavior and population groupscopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
