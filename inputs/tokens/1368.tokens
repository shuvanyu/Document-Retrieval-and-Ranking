acrylamide is a probable human carcinogen with industrial contact tobacco smoking and foods processed at high temperatures as the main routes of exposurein animal studies oral intake of acrylamide has been related to cancer development with indications that the increased cancer occurrence especially regards endocrine related tumorsin human epidemiological studies dietary exposure to acrylamide has also been suggested related to higher risk of endocrine related tumors like estrogen sensitive breast cancerthe aim of the present study was to evaluate if prediagnostic acrylamide exposure measured by acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin adducts aahb and gahb were associated to mortality in breast cancer casesamong 24697 postmenopausal women included into a danish cohort between 1993 and 1997 420 developed breast cancer before 2001 and 110 died before 2009aahb and gahb concentrations measured in blood samples were related to mortality by cox proportional hazard modelsestimates are given per 25 pmolg globin higher levelsamong nonsmokers higher concentrations of gahb were associated to a higher hazard rate of breast cancer specific mortality hr 95 ci 163 106251 the hazard rate among women diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive tumors was hr 95 ci 223 138361for aahb the tendency was similar but only statistically significant among those with estrogen receptor positive tumors hr 95 ci 131 102169in conclusion the present study indicates that prediagnostic exposure to acrylamide may be related to mortality among breast cancer patients and that this may especially concern the most endocrine related type of breast cancercopyright  2012 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
