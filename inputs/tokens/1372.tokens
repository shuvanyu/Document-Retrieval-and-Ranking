the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the dietary phytosterol betasitosterol sit and the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen tam on cell growth and ceramide cer metabolism in mcf7 and mdamb231 human breast cancer cellsthe mcf7 and mdamb231 cell lines were studied as models of estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cellsgrowth of both cell lines as determined using the sulforhodamine b assay was inhibited by treatment with 16 microm sit but only mcf7 cell growth was inhibited by treatment with 1 microm tamthe combination of sit and tam further inhibited growth in both cell lines most significantly in mdamb231 cellscer is a proapoptotic signal and cer levels were increased in both mcf7 and mdamb231 cells by individual treatment with sit and tam and the combined treatment raised cellular cer content even furthersit and tam raised cer levels by different meanssit potently activated de novo cer synthesis in both mcf7 and mdamb231 cells by stimulating serine palmitoyltransferase activity whereas tam promoted cer accumulation in both cell types by inhibiting cer glycosylationthese results suggest that the combination regimen of dietary sit and tam chemotherapy may be beneficial in the management of breast cancer patients
