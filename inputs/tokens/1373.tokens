background mechanistic studies largely support the chemopreventive potential of statinshowever results of epidemiologic studies investigating statin use and breast cancer risk have been inconsistent and lacked the ability to evaluate longterm statin usematerials and methods we utilized data from a populationbased casecontrol study of breast cancer conducted in the seattlepuget sound region to investigate the relationship between longterm statin use and breast cancer risk916 invasive ductal carcinoma idc and 1068 invasive lobular carcinoma ilc cases 5574 years of age diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 were compared to 902 control womenall participants were interviewed inperson and data on hypercholesterolemia and all episodes of lipid lowering medication use were collected through a structured questionnairewe assessed the relationship between statin use and idc and ilc risk using polytomous logistic regressionresults current users of statins for 10 years or longer had a 183fold increased risk of idc 95 confidence interval ci 114293 and a 197fold increased risk of ilc 95 ci 125312 compared to never users of statinsamong women diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia current users of statins for 10 years or longer had more than double the risk of both idc odds ratio or 204 95 ci 117357 and ilc or 243 95 ci 140421 compared to never usersconclusion in this contemporary populationbased casecontrol study longterm use of statins was associated with increased risks of both idc and ilcimpact additional studies with similarly high frequencies of statin use for various durations are needed to confirm this novel finding
