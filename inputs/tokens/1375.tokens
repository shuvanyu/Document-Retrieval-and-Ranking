the specific role of dietary fat in breast cancer progression is unclear although a lowfat diet was associated with decreased recurrence of estrogen receptor alpha negative er breast cancerer basallike mdamb231 and mdamb436 breast cancer cell lines contained a greater number of cytoplasmic lipid droplets compared to luminal er mcf7 cellstherefore we studied lipid storage functions in these cellsboth triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester ce concentrations were higher in the er cells but the ability to synthesize ce distinguished the two types of breast cancer cellshigher baseline oleic acid and ldlstimulated ce concentrations were found in er compared to er cellsthe differences corresponded to greater mrna and protein levels of acylcoacholesterol acyltransferase 1 acat1 higher acat activity higher caveolin1 protein levels greater ldl uptake and lower de novo cholesterol synthesis in er cellshuman ldl stimulated proliferation of er mdamb231 cells but had little effect on proliferation of er mcf7 cellsthe functional significance of these findings was demonstrated by the observation that the acat inhibitor cp113818 reduced proliferation of breast cancer cells and specifically reduced ldlinduced proliferation of er cellstaken together our studies show that a greater ability to take up store and utilize exogenous cholesterol confers a proliferative advantage to basallike er breast cancer cellsdifferences in lipid uptake and storage capability may at least partially explain the differential effect of a lowfat diet on human breast cancer recurrence
