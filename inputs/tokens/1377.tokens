the content of low density lipoprotein ldl receptors in tissue from primary breast cancers was determined and its prognostic information compared with that of variables of established prognostic importancefrozen tumour specimens were selected and tissue from 72 patients 32 of whom had died were studiedthe ldl receptor content showed an inverse correlation with the survival timeanalysis by a multivariate statistical method showed that the presence of axillary metastasis content of receptors for oestrogen and ldl diameter of the tumour and dna pattern were all of prognostic value with regard to patient survivalimproved methods of predicting survival time in patients with breast cancer may be of value in the choice of treatment for individual patients
