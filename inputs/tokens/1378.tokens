background breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the united statesextensive research has been completed to evaluate the relationship between dietary factors and breast cancer risk and survival after breast cancer however a summary report with clinical inference is neededmaterials and methods this review summarizes the current epidemiological and clinical trial evidence relating diet to breast cancer incidence recurrence survival and mortalitythe review includes emerging epidemiological studies that assess risk within breast cancer subtypes as well as a summary of previous and ongoing dietary intervention trials designed to modify breast cancer riskresults the available literature suggests that both lowfat and highfiber diets may be weakly protective against breast cancer whereas total energy intake and alcohol appear to be positively associatedfiber may be weakly protective possibly through modulation of estrogen whereas fruit and vegetable intake is not clearly associated with riskobesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal disease and adult weight gain should be avoided to reduce riskin survivors diet has the greatest potential influence on overall mortality rather than breast cancerspecific eventsconclusion diet is modestly associated with breast cancer risk associations appear more pronounced for postmenopausal disease and healthy choices after diagnosis and treatment likely support longevity more so than reduced risk for recurrent disease
