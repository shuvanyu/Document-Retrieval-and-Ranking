allergic disorders encompass skin food and respiratory allergiessensitization to a normally harmless allergen results in the immune system being biased to a predominant thelper type 2 responsereexposure to the same allergen leads to a robust secretion of allergyrelated mediators that eventually triggers symptomsour understanding of these disorders has enabled the search of therapeutic approaches that can either modulate the sensitization process or impact on allergic mediators thus helping manage allergic symptomspolyphenols are one such class of compounds that are found in foods and plant sources and have been investigated for their antiallergic effect in different disease models and in human clinical trialstheir antiinflammatory profile is known to impact on the recruitment of immune cells to the skin and in preventing the development of secondary infections following disruption of the skin barrierthe interaction of polyphenols with proteins can modulate the process of allergic sensitization and their direct effect on allergic effector cells such as mast cells inhibit mediator release resulting in the alleviation of symptomsin addition their endogenous antioxidant ability limits the extent of cellular injury from free radicals during the allergic insultoverall polyphenols hold promise as antiallergy agents capable of influencing multiple biological pathways and immune cell functions in the allergic immune response and deserve further investigationthe objective of the current review is to summarize the key findings and progress made in studying polyphenols as antiallergic ingredientsspecial emphasis is placed in this review to highlight key physiological cellular and signalling pathways implicated in the mechanism of action of different polyphenols in the context of allergic disorders and their manifestations 2011 blackwell publishing ltd
