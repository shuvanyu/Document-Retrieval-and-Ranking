a role for diet in the pathophysiology of asthma may be mediated by altered immune or antioxidant activity with consequent effects on airway inflammationwe evaluated associations between several dietary factors assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and incidence of asthma over a 10yr period in 77866 women 34 to 68 yr of agewomen in the highest quintile of vitamin e intake from diet but not from supplements had a risk of 053 95 confidence interval ci  033 to 086 compared with women in the lowest quintilethis relationship however was attenuated when the contribution from nuts a major source of vitamin e in these data and a possible allergen was removed relative risk  074 050 to 110 p for trend  0007positive associations were found for vitamins c and e from supplements but appeared to be explained by women at high risk of asthma initiating use of vitamin supplements prior to diagnosisa nonsignificant inverse association with carotene intake was noted but no clear relations with asthma were demonstrated for intake of linoleic acid or omega3 fatty acidsthese data suggest that antioxidant supplementation and intake of various fats during adulthood are not important determinants of asthma although vitamin e from diet may have a modest protective effect
