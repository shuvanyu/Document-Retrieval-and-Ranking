background fresh fruit consumption and vitamin c intake have been associated with improved lung function in adultswhether this is due to enhancement of lung growth to a reduction in lung function decline or to protection against bronchospasm is unclearmethods in a cross sectional school based survey of 2650 children aged 811 from 10 towns in england and wales the main outcome measure was forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 standardised for body size and sexexposure was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire to parents and by measurement of plasma levels of vitamin c in a subsample of 278 childrenresults fev1 was positively associated with frequency of fresh fruit consumptionafter adjustment for possible confounding variables including social class and passive smoking those who never ate any fresh fruit had an estimated fev1 some 79 ml 43 lower than those who ate these items more than once a day 95 ci 22 to 136 mlthe association between fev1 and fruit consumption was stronger in subjects with wheeze than in nonwheezers p  0020 for difference in trend though wheeze itself was not related to fresh fruit consumptionfrequency of consumption of salads and of green vegetables were both associated with fev1 but the relationships were weaker than for fresh fruitplasma vitamin c levels were unrelated to fev1 r   001 p  092 or to wheeze and were only weakly related to fresh fruit consumption r  013 p  0055conclusions fresh fruit consumption appears to have a beneficial effect on lung function in childrenfurther work is needed to confirm whether the effect is restricted to subjects who wheeze and to identify the specific nutrient involved
