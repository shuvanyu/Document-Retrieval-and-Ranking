several studies have suggested that the increasing prevalence of symptoms of asthma rhinitis and eczema could be associated with dietary factorsin the present paper a global analysis of prevalence rates of wheeze allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema was performed in relation to diet as defined by national food intake dataanalyses were based on the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood isaac data for 67 and 1314 yr old childrensymptoms of wheeze allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema symptom prevalence were regressed against per capita food intake and adjusted for gross national product to account for economic developmentdietary data were based on 1995 food and agriculture organisation of the united nations data for 53 of the 56 countries that took part in isaac phase i 19941995the 1314 year age group showed a consistent pattern of decreases in symptoms of wheeze current and severe allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema associated with increased per capita consumption of calories from cereal and rice protein from cereals and nuts starch as well as vegetables and vegetable nutrientsthe video questionnaire data for 1314 yr olds and the isaac data for 67 yr olds showed similar patterns for these foodsa consistent inverse relationship was seen between prevalence rates of the three conditions and the intake of starch cereals and vegetablesif these findings could be generalised and if the average daily consumption of these foods increased it is speculated that an important decrease in symptom prevalence may be achieved
