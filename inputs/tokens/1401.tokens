the intestinal flora is considered to have an impact on the development of the immune systemin the anthroposophic lifestyle a diet comprising vegetables spontaneously fermented by lactobacilli and a restrictive use of antibiotics antipyretics and vaccinations is typicalthe aim of this study was to assess the gut flora in infants in relation to certain lifestyle characteristics associated with anthroposophysixtynine children  2 years of age with an anthroposophic lifestyle and 59 infants of a similar age with a traditional lifestyle were clinically examined and questionnaire replies assessedfecal samples were analyzed by bacterial enumeration bacterial typing through biochemical fingerprinting and by measuring microfloraassociated characteristics macsthe numbers of colonyforming units cfug of feces were significantly higher for enterococci and lactic acid bacteria in children who had never been exposed to antibiotics 55 x 107 vs 21 x 107 p  0001 and 10 x 107 vs 41 x 107 p  001 respectivelyfurthermore the number of enterococci was significantly higher in breastfed and vegetarian infants p  001the diversity simpsons diversity index of lactobacilli as determined by biochemical fingerprinting was higher in infants born at home than in those born in hospital p  001several macs were related to specific lifestyle features and infants with an anthroposophic lifestyle had a higher proportion of acetic acid and a lower proportion of propionic acid in their stool as compared to the control childrenin conclusion lifestyle factors related to the anthroposophic way of life influenced the composition of the gut flora in the infantsthese differences may contribute to the lower prevalence of atopic disease previously observed in children in anthroposophic families
