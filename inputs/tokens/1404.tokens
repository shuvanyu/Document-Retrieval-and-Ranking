this isaac phase three synthesis provides summarised information on the main findings of the study regional tables and figures related to the prevalence and severity of current symptoms of asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the main regions of the worldthe large number of surveyed children 1200000 the large number of centres 233 and countries 98 that participated in isaac phase three makes this study the most comprehensive survey of these diseases ever undertakenglobally the prevalence for current asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the 1314year age group was 141 146 and 73 respectivelyin the 67year age group the prevalence for current asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema was 117 85 and 79 respectivelythe study shows a wide variability in the prevalence and severity of asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema which occurs not just between regions and countries but between centres in the same country and centres in the same citythis study definitively establishes that the prevalence of those diseases can be very high in nonaffluent centres with low socioeconomic conditionsthe large variability also suggests a crucial role of local environment characteristics to determine the differences in prevalence between one place and anotherthus isaac phase three has provided a large body of epidemiological information on asthma rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in childhood from contrasting environments which is expected to yield new clues about the aetiology of those conditions and reasons for their marked global variabilitycopyright  2012 seicappublished by elsevier espanaall rights reserved
