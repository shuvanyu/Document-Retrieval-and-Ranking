current understanding of the use of exclusion diets in the management of asthma in children is limited and controversialthe aim of this study was to examine the effects of excluding eggs and milk on the occurrence of symptoms in children with asthma and involved 22 children aged between three and 14 years clinically diagnosed as having mild to moderate diseasethe investigation was single blind and prospective and parents were given the option of volunteering to join the experiment group avoiding eggs milk and their products for eight weeks or the control group who consumed their customary foodthirteen children were recruited to the experimental group and nine to the control groupa trained paediatrician at the beginning and end of the study period assessed the childrena sevenday assessment of food intake was made before during and immediately after the period of dietary intervention in both groupsa blood sample was taken from each child for determination of food specific antibodies and in those children who could do so the peak expiratory flow rate pefr was measuredbased on the recommended nutrient intake rni the mean percentage energy intake of the children in the experimental group was significantly lower p  005 in the experimental groupafter the eightweek study period and compared with baseline values the mean serum antiovalbumin igg and antibeta lactoglobulin igg concentrations were statistically significantly reduced p  005 for both in the experimental groupin contrast the values for antiovalbumin igg in the control group were significantly increased and those for antibeta lactoglobulin igg were practically unchangedthe total ige values were unchanged in both groupsover the study period the pefr in those children in the experimental group able to perform the test was significantly increased but no such change was noted in the children in the control group who could do the testthese results suggest that even over the short time period of eight weeks an egg and milkfree diet can reduce atopic symptoms and improve lung function in asthmatic children
