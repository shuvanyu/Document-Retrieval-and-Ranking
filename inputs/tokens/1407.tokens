background the prevalence of allergic diseases seems to have increased particularly over the past 3540 yearsfurthermore allergic disease is less common among children in the formerly socialist countries of central and eastern europe as compared with western europeit has been suggested that a reduced microbial stimulation during infancy and early childhood would result in a slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between th1 and th2like immunityaims to test the hypothesis that allergic disease among children may be associated with differences in their intestinal microflora in two countries with a low estonia and a high sweden prevalence of allergymethods from a prospective study of the development of allergy in relation to environmental factors 29 estonian and 33 swedish 2yearold children were selectedthey were either nonallergic n  36 or had a confirmed diagnosis of allergy n  27 as verified by typical history and at least one positive skin prick test to egg or cows milkweighed samples of faeces were serially diluted 102109 and grown under anaerobic conditionsthe counts of the various genera and species were calculated for each childin addition the relative amounts of the particular microbes were expressed as a proportion of the total countresults the allergic children in estonia and sweden were less often colonized with lactobacilli p  001 as compared with the nonallergic children in the two countriesin contrast the allergic children harboured higher counts of aerobic microorganisms p  005 particularly coliforms p  001 and staphylococcus aureus p  005the proportions of aerobic bacteria of the intestinal flora were also higher in the allergic children p  005 while the opposite was true for anaerobes p  005similarly in the allergic children the proportions of coliforms were higher p  005 and bacteroides lower p  005 than in the nonallergic childrenconclusions differences in the indigenous intestinal flora might affect the development and priming of the immune system in early childhood similar to what has been shown in rodentsthe role of intestinal microflora in relation to the development of infant immunity and the possible consequences for allergic diseases later in life requires further study particularly as it would be readily available for intervention as a means for primary prevention of allergy by the administration of probiotic bacteria
