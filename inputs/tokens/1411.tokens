background rice can be a major source of inorganic arsenic asi for many subpopulationsrice products are also used as ingredients in prepared foods some of which may not be obviously rice basedorganic brown rice syrup obrs is used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to highfructose corn syrupwe hypothesized that obrs introduces as into these productsobjective we determined the concentration and speciation of as in commercially available brown rice syrups and in products containing obrs including toddler formula cerealenergy bars and highenergy foods used by endurance athletesmethods we used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms and ion chromatography coupled to icpms to determine total as astotal concentrations and as speciation in products purchased via the internet or in stores in the hanover new hampshire areadiscussion we found that obrs can contain high concentrations of asi and dimethylarsenate dmaan organic toddler milk formula containing obrs as the primary ingredient had astotal concentrations up to six times the us environmental protection agency safe drinking water limitcereal bars and highenergy foods containing obrs also had higher as concentrations than equivalent products that did not contain obrsasi was the main as species in most food products tested in this studyconclusions there are currently no us regulations applicable to as in food but our findings suggest that the obrs products we evaluated may introduce significant concentrations of asi into an individuals dietthus we conclude that there is an urgent need for regulatory limits on as in food
