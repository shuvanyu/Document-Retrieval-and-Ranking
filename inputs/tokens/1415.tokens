background in the absence of current cumulative dietary exposure assessments this analysis was conducted to estimate exposure to multiple dietary contaminants for children who are more vulnerable to toxic exposure than adultsmethods we estimated exposure to multiple food contaminants based on dietary data from preschoolage children 24 years n207 schoolage children 57 years n157 parents of young children n446 and older adults n149we compared exposure estimates for eleven toxic compounds acrylamide arsenic lead mercury chlorpyrifos permethrin endosulfan dieldrin chlordane dde and dioxin based on selfreported food frequency data by age groupto determine if cancer and noncancer benchmark levels were exceeded chemical levels in food were derived from publicly available databases including the total diet studyresults cancer benchmark levels were exceeded by all children 100 for arsenic dieldrin dde and dioxinsnoncancer benchmarks were exceeded by 95 of preschoolage children for acrylamide and by 10 of preschoolage children for mercurypreschoolage children had significantly higher estimated intakes of 6 of 11 compounds compared to schoolage children p00001 to p002based on selfreported dietary data the greatest exposure to pesticides from foods included in this analysis were tomatoes peaches apples peppers grapes lettuce broccoli strawberries spinach dairy pears green beans and celeryconclusions dietary strategies to reduce exposure to toxic compounds for which cancer and noncancer benchmarks are exceeded by children vary by compoundthese strategies include consuming organically produced dairy and selected fruits and vegetables to reduce pesticide intake consuming less animal foods meat dairy and fish to reduce intake of persistent organic pollutants and metals and consuming lower quantities of chips cereal crackers and other processed carbohydrate foods to reduce acrylamide intake
