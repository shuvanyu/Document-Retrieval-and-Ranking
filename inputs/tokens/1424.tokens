longterm caloric restriction cr is a robust means of reducing agerelated diseases and extending life span in multiple species but the effects in humans are unknownthe low caloric intake long life expectancy and the high prevalence of centenarians in okinawa have been used as an argument to support the cr hypothesis in humanshowever no longterm epidemiologic analysis has been conducted on traditional dietary patterns energy balance and potential cr phenotypes for the specific cohort of okinawans who are purported to have had a calorically restricted dietnor has this cohorts subsequent mortality experience been rigorously studiedtherefore we investigated six decades of archived population data on the elderly cohort of okinawans aged 65plus for evidence of cranalyses included traditional diet composition energy intake energy expenditure anthropometry plasma dhea mortality from agerelated diseases and current survival patternsfindings include low caloric intake and negative energy balance at younger ages little weight gain with age lifelong low bmi relatively high plasma dhea levels at older ages low risk for mortality from agerelated diseases and survival patterns consistent with extended mean and maximum life spanthis study lends epidemiologic support for phenotypic benefits of cr in humans and is consistent with the wellknown literature on animals with regard to cr phenotypes and healthy aging
