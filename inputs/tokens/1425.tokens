increased plasma levels of adiponectin metformin therapy of diabetes rapamycin administration in transplant patients and lifelong consumption of lowprotein plantbased diets have all been linked to decreased risk for various cancersthese benefits may be mediated at least in part by downregulated activity of the mtorc1 complex a key regulator of protein translationby boosting the effective availability of the translation initiator eif4e mtorc1 activity promotes the translation of a number of weak mrnas that code for proteins often upregulated in cancer that promote cellular proliferation invasiveness and angiogenesis and that abet cancer promotion and chemoresistance by opposing apoptosismeasures which inhibit eif4e activity either directly or indirectly may have utility not only for cancer prevention but also for the treatment of many cancers in which eif4e drives malignancysince eif4e is overexpressed in many cancers strategies which target eif4e directlysome of which are now being assessed clinicallymay have the broadest efficacy in this regardmany of the weak mrnas coding for proteins that promote malignant behavior or chemoresistance are regulated transcriptionally by nfkappab andor stat3 which are active in a high proportion of cancers thus regimens concurrently targeting eif4e nfkappab and stat3 may suppress these proteins at both the transcriptional and translational levels potentially achieving a very marked reduction in their expressioncopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
