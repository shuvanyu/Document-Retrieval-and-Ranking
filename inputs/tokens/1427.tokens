dietary restriction dr extends the lifespan of a wide range of species although the universality of this effect has never been quantitatively examinedhere we report the first comprehensive comparative metaanalysis of dr across studies and speciesoverall dr significantly increased lifespan but this effect is modulated by several factorsin general dr has less effect in extending lifespan in males and also in nonmodel organismssurprisingly the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension via dr than the degree of caloric restrictionfurthermore we show that reduction in both agedependent and ageindependent mortality rates drives life extension by dr among the wellstudied laboratory model species yeast nematode worms fruit flies and rodentsour results suggest that convergent adaptation to laboratory conditions better explains the observed drlongevity relationship than evolutionary conservation although alternative explanations are possible 2012 the authorsaging cell  2012 blackwell publishing ltdanatomical society of great britain and ireland
