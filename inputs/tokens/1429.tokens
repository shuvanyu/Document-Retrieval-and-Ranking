ageing is a challenge for any living organism and human longevity is a complex phenotypewith increasing life expectancy maintaining longterm health functionality and wellbeing during ageing has become an essential goalto increase our understanding of how ageing works it may be advantageous to analyze the phenotype of centenarians perhaps one of the best examples of successful ageinghealthy ageing involves the interaction between genes the environment and lifestyle factors particularly dietbesides evaluating specific geneenvironment interactions in relation to exceptional longevity it is important to focus attention on modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet and nutrition to achieve extension of health spanfurthermore a better understanding of human longevity may assist in the design of strategies to extend the duration of optimal human healthin this article we briefly discuss relevant topics on ageing and longevity with particular focus on dietary patterns of centenarians and nutrientsensing pathways that have a pivotal role in the regulation of life spanfinally we also discuss the potential role of nrf2 system in the proageing signaling emphasizing its phytohormetic activation
