introduction vegetarian diets are considered to promote health and reduce the risk of some chronic diseasesit is also known that restriction or exclusion of animal foods may result in low intake of essential nutrientsthe aim of the presented study was to assess the intake and serum status of vitamin b12 folate vitamins a e and d as well as concentrations of homocysteine total antioxidant status and iron balance in polish vegetarian childrenmaterial and methods the study included 50 children aged 511 who had been referred to the institute of mother and child for dietary consultationfrom those 32 were vegetarians aged 6542 years and 18 omnivores aged 7927 yearsdietary constituents were analyzed using the nutritional programme dietetyk2folate and vitamin b12 were determined with a chemiluminescence immunoassay total homocysteine with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay and tas total antioxidant status by colorimetric methodvitamin a and e in serum were determined by the highpressure liquid chromatography method hplc and vitamin d by immunoenzymatic assay elisaconcentrations of iron ferritin transferrin and total ironbinding capacity tibc in serum were determined by commercially available kitsresults in vegetarian children daily intake of vitamin b12 16 ěg was in the recommended range that of folate 195 ěg and vitamin a 1245 ěg higher but vitamin e slightly lower 66 ěg and threefold lower vitamin d 11 ěg than references allowanceserum concentrations of vitamin b12 548 pgml folate 128 ngml vitamin a 12 ěmoll vitamin e 156 ěmoll were within physiological range but that of vitamin d 137 ěgl was only half of the lowest limit of the reference valuein vegetarian children in comparison to omnivorous similar levels of homocysteine 613 ěmoll vs 545 ěmoll and vitamin a 117 ěmoll vs 132 ěmoll were observedlower p005 values of vitamin e 156 ěmoll vs 184 ěmoll and tas 121 mmoll vs 130 mmoll p00001 were foundconcentrations of iron markers were in physiological rangeconclusion obtained results indicated that intakes of vitamin b12 and folic acid from vegetarian diets are sufficient to maintain serum concentrations of both homocysteine and iron in the range observed in omnivorous childrenhigh consumption of vitamin a and low vitamin e only slightly affected their serum valuessignificantly lower concentration of serum vitamin e in vegetarian children in comparison to nonvegetarians may be reflected with statistically significant lowering of total antioxidant statusinsufficient intake of vitamin d and its low serum concentration should be under close monitoring in vegetarian childrenin order to prevent vitamin d deficiency appropriate agedependent supplementation should be considered
