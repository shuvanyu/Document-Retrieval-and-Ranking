over the last several years new evidence has kept pouring in about the remarkable effect of caloric restriction cr on the conspicuous bedfellows aging and cancerthrough the use of various animal models it is now well established that by reducing calorie intake one can not only increase life span but also lower the risk of various age related diseases such as cancercancer cells are believed to be more dependent on glycolysis for their energy requirements than normal cells and therefore can be easily targeted by alteration in the energymetabolic pathways a hallmark of crapart from inhibiting the growth of transplantable tumors cr has been also shown to inhibit the development of spontaneous radiation and chemically induced tumorsthe question regarding the potentiality of the antitumor effect of cr in humans has been in part answered by the resistance of a cohort of women who had suffered from anorexia in their early life to breast cancerhowever human research on the beneficial effect of cr is still at an early stage and needs further validationthough the complete mechanism of the antitumor effect of cr is far from clear the plausible involvement of nutrient sensing pathways or igf1 pathways proposed for its antiaging action cannot be overruledin fact cancer cell lines mutant for proteins involved in igf1 pathways failed to respond to crin addition cr decreases the levels of many growth factors anabolic hormones inflammatory cytokines and oxidative markers that are deregulated in several cancersin this review we discuss the antitumor effect of cr describing experiments done in vitro in tumor models and in vivo in mouse models in which the tumor was induced by means of radiation or chemical exposure expressing oncogenes or deleting tumor suppression geneswe also discuss the proposed mechanisms of cr antitumor actionlastly we argue the necessity of gene expression studies in cancerous versus normal cells upon cr
