to date the only intervention that has consistently been shown to slow the rate of aging and to increase mean and maximum lifespan in shortlived species is lifelong calorie restrictionit is yet unclear whether longterm calorie restriction in longer lived species ieprimates and humans will have a similar effectin humans several studies investigating shortterm calorie restriction or weight loss programs suggest beneficial outcomes on parameters of cardiovascular diseasestudies on longterm calorie restriction are performed on a selfselected group of human subjects and show similar effectshowever few studies are currently investigating the quality of life and potential pitfalls of longterm calorie restriction in humansit is likely that some of the physiological and psychological effects of caloric restriction that occur in animals may impact the human life very differentlyfor certain calorie restriction has a plethora of health benefits in mammals such as a reduction in agerelated diseases such as cancerhowever despite the magic of cr this intervention in humans may present itself with a number of health concerns which may not be applicable to or impact the life of experimental animals but may do so in humansthese potential pitfalls and side effects are not clearly addressed in the literature and will be a focus of this review
