a streptomycete was isolated from an easter island soil sample and found to inhibit candida albicans microsporum gypseum and trichophyton granulosumthe antibioticproducing microorganism was characterized and identified as streptomyces hygroscopicusthe antifungal principle was extracted with organic solvent from the mycelium isolated in crystalline form and named rapamycinrapamycin is mainly active against candida albicans minimum inhibitory concentration against ten strains ranged from 002 to 02 mugmlits apparent activity against microsporum gypseum and trichophyton granulosum is lower because of its instability in culture media on prolonged incubation required by these fungino activity was observed against grampositive and gramnegative bacteriaacute toxicity in mice is low
