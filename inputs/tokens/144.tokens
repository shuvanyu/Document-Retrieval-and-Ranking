the effects of glucocorticoid on lipid metabolism of broiler chicken gallus gallus domesticus skeletal muscle were investigatedmale arbor acres chickens 35 days old were subjected to dexamethasone treatment for 3 dayswe found that dexamethasone retards body growth while facilitating lipid accumulationin m pectoralis major pm dexamethasone increased the expression of glucocorticoid receptor gr fatty acid transport protein 1 fatp1 heart fatty acidbinding protein hfabp and longchain acylcoa dehydrogenase lcad mrna and decreased the expression of liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 lcpt1 adenosinemonophosphateactivated protein kinase ampk α2 and lipoprotein lipase lpl mrnalpl activity was also decreasedin m biceps femoris bf the levels of gr fatp1 and lcpt1 mrna were increasedampkα thr172 phosphorylation and ctp1 activity of skeletal muscle were decreased by dexamethasonein fed chickens dexamethasone enhanced very lowdensity lipoprotein receptor vldlr expression and ampk activity in muscle but it impaired the expression of lpl and lcpt1 mrna and lpl activity in pm and augmented the expression of gr lpl hfabp lcpt1 lcad and ampkα2 mrna in bfadipose triglyceride lipase atgl protein expression was not affected by dexamethasonein conclusion in the fasting state dexamethasoneinducedretarded fatty acid utilisation may be involved in the augmented intramyocellular lipid accumulation in both glycolytic pm and oxidative bf muscle tissuesin the fed state dexamethasone promoted the transcriptional activity of genes related to lipid uptake and oxidation in musclesunmatched lipid uptake and utilisation are suggested to be involved in the augmented intramyocellular lipid accumulation
