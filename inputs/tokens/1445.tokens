our understanding of coronary artery disease risk and the atherosclerotic process has changed greatly in recent yearsfor example it is now known that angiographically apparent coronary artery plaque is not the major cause of myocardial infarction mirather it is unstable soft plaque that cannot be seen angiographically that is prone to rupture and result in infarctionalso important are changes in vascular reactivity resulting from dietcholesterol levels by themselves reveal little about a patients coronary artery disease riskmost infarctions occur in patients who have normal total cholesterol levelsatrisk patients can be identified using the ratio of totaltohighdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levelsthe ratio of triglyceride to hdl cholesterol levels is also importantsimple steps to assess patients risk in practice are outlinedprimary prevention trials demonstrate that coronary artery disease risk can be lowered dramatically with diet and drug therapy
