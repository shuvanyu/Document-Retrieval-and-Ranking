inositol hexaphosphate insp6 or ip6 is ubiquitousat 10 microm to 1 mm concentrations ip6 and its lower phosphorylated forms ip15 as well as inositol ins are contained in most mammalian cells wherein they are important in regulating vital cellular functions such as signal transduction cell proliferation and differentiationa striking anticancer action of ip6 has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro which is based on the hypotheses that exogenously administered ip6 may be internalized dephosphorylated to ip15 and inhibit cell growththere is additional evidence that ins alone may further enhance the anticancer effect of ip6besides decreasing cellular proliferation ip6 also causes differentiation of malignant cells often resulting in a reversion to normal phenotypethese data strongly point towards the involvement of signal transduction pathways cell cycle regulatory genes differentiation genes oncogenes and perhaps tumor suppressor genes in bringing about the observed antineoplastic action of ip6
