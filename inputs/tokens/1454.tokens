inositol hexaphosphate ip6 is a naturally occurring polyphosphorylated carbohydrate abundantly present in many plant sources and in certain highfiber diets such as cereals and legumesin addition to being found in plants ip6 is contained in almost all mammalian cells although in much smaller amounts where it is important in regulating vital cellular functions such as signal transduction cell proliferation and differentiationfor a long time ip6 has been recognized as a natural antioxidantrecently ip6 has received much attention for its role in cancer prevention and control of experimental tumor growth progression and metastasisin addition ip6 possesses other significant benefits for human health such as the ability to enhance immune system prevent pathological calcification and kidney stone formation lower elevated serum cholesterol and reduce pathological platelet activityin this review we show the efficacy and discuss some of the molecular mechanisms that govern the action of this dietary agentexogenously administered ip6 is rapidly taken up into cells and dephosphorylated to lower inositol phosphates which further affect signal transduction pathways resulting in cell cycle arresta striking anticancer action of ip6 was demonstrated in different experimental modelsin addition to reducing cell proliferation ip6 also induces differentiation of malignant cellsenhanced immunity and antioxidant properties also contribute to tumor cell destructionpreliminary studies in humans show that ip6 and inositol the precursor molecule of ip6 appear to enhance the anticancer effect of conventional chemotherapy control cancer metastases and improve quality of lifebecause it is abundantly present in regular diet efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and safe ip6  inositol holds great promise in our strategies for cancer prevention and therapythere is clearly enough evidence to justify the initiation of fullscale clinical trials in humans
