introduction matrix metalloproteinases mmps have repeatedly been shown to play a very active role in extracellular matrix degradation associated with tumor invasion and metastasistissue inhibitors of mmps timps are wellknown for their ability to inhibit mmp activity thereby inhibiting malignant progressioninositol hexaphosphate ip6 phytic acid has been recognized to have both preventive and therapeutic effects against various cancers including that of colonin in vitro studies ip6 has been demonstrated to inhibit cancer cell adhesion and migrationin the present study the effect of ip6 on the expression of mmp and timp genes was evaluated in unstimulated and il1βstimulated colon cancer cell line caco2materials and methods realtime qrtpcr was used to validate the transcription level of selected mmp and timp genes in caco2 cells after treatment with 1 ngml of il1β 25 mm of ip6 and both for 6 12 and 24 h results stimulation of cells with il1β only resulted in an overexpression of mmp and their timp mrnasa significant decrease in mmp13 mmp3 mmp2 and timp1 basal expression was achieved by ip6ip6 was also an efficient downregulator of mmp1 mmp9 and timp2 genes transcription stimulated by il1β in 6 h lasting cultureafter 12 h il1βinduced mmp2 mrna expression was significantly reduced by ip6conclusion proinflammatory cytokine il1β upregulates mmp and timp mrnas expression in colon cancer epithelial cells caco2ip6 25 mm influences constitutive expression of both mmp and timp genes and downregulates il1β stimulated transcription of some of these genesip6 exerts its antimetastatic activity through modulation of mmp and timp genes expression to prevent cancer cell migration and invasion
