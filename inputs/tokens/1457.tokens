the incidence of colonic cancer differs widely between various human populationsit has been suggested that dietary fiber content is of utmost importance and is inversely related to the occurrence of colonic cancerhowever highfiber diets are not always correlated with low frequency of colonic cancer suggesting the involvement of additional dietary constituentsinositol hexaphosphate phytic acid is an abundant plant seed component present in many but not all fiberrich dietsthe authors have found that phytic acid is a potent inhibitor of ironmediated generation of the hazardous oxidant hydroxyl radicalherein the authors propose that inhibition of intracolonic hydroxyl radical generation via the chelation of reactive iron by phytic acid may help explain the suppression of colonic carcinogenesis and other inflammatory bowel diseases by diets rich in phytic acid
