background bioavailability of omega3 fatty acids fa depends on their chemical formsuperior bioavailability has been suggested for phospholipid pl bound omega3 fa in krill oil but identical doses of different chemical forms have not been comparedmethods in a doubleblinded crossover trial we compared the uptake of three epadha formulations derived from fish oil reesterified triacylglycerides rtag ethylesters ee and krill oil mainly plchanges of the fa compositions in plasma pl were used as a proxy for bioavailabilitytwelve healthy young men mean age 31 y were randomized to 1680 mg epadha given either as rtag ee or krill oilfa levels in plasma pl were analyzed predose and 2 4 6 8 24 48 and 72 h after capsule ingestionadditionally the proportion of free epa and dha in the applied supplements was analyzedresults the highest incorporation of epadha into plasma pl was provoked by krill oil mean auc072 h 8003  3471h followed by fish oil rtag mean auc072 h 5978  3675h and ee mean auc072 h 4753  3842hdue to high standard deviation values there were no significant differences for dha and the sum of epadha levels between the three treatmentshowever a trend p  0057 was observed for the differences in epa bioavailabilitystatistical pairwise group comparisons revealed a trend p  0086 between rtag and krill oilfa analysis of the supplements showed that the krill oil sample contained 22 of the total epa amount as free epa and 21 of the total dha amount as free dha while the two fish oil samples did not contain any free faconclusion further studies with a larger sample size carried out over a longer period are needed to substantiate our findings and to determine differences in epadha bioavailability between three common chemical forms of lc n3 fa rtag ee and krill oilthe unexpected high content of free epa and dha in krill oil which might have a significant influence on the availability of epadha from krill oil should be investigated in more depth and taken into consideration in future trials
