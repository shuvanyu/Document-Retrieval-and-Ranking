in a 6year prospective study the authors examined the relation between diet and incident colon cancer among 32051 nonhispanic white cohort members of the adventist health study california 19761982 who at baseline had no documented or reported history of cancerthe risk of colon cancer was determined from proportional hazards regression with adjustment for age and other covariatesthe authors found a positive association with total meat intake risk ratio rr for  or 1 timeweek vs no meat intake  185 95 confidence interval ci 119287 p for trend  001 and among subjects who favored specific types of meat positive associations with red meat intake rr for  or 1 timeweek vs no red meat intake  190 95 ci 116311 p for trend  002 and white meat intake rr for  or 1 timeweek vs no white meat intake  329 95 ci 160675 p for trend  0006an inverse association with legume intake rr for 2 timesweek vs 1 timeweek  053 95 ci 033086 p for trend  003 was observedamong men a positive association with body mass index was observed relative to the rr for tertile iii 256 kgm2 vs tertile i 225 kgm2  263 95 ci 112613 p for trend  005a complex relation was identified whereby subjects exhibiting a high red meat intake a low legume intake and a high body mass experienced a more than threefold elevation in risk relative to all other patterns based on these variablesthis pattern of putative risk factors would likely contribute to increases in both insulin resistance high body mass high red meat intake and glycemic load low legume intake a synergism that if causal implicates hyperinsulinemic exposure in colon carcinogenesisthe overall findings from this cohort identify both red meat intake and white meat intake as important dietary risk factors for colon cancer and raise the possibility that the risk due to red meat intake reflects a more complex etiology
