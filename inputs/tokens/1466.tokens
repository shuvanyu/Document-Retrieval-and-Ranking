recent research has demonstrated that successful simultaneous treatment of multiple risk factors including cholesterol triglycerides homocysteine lipoprotein a lpa fibrinogen antioxidants endothelial dysfunction inflammation infection and dietary factors can lead to the regression of coronary artery disease and the recovery of viable myocardiumhowever preliminary work revealed that a number of individuals enrolled in the original study went on popular highprotein diets in an effort to lose weightdespite increasing numbers of individuals following highprotein diets little or no information is currently available regarding the effect of these diets on coronary artery disease and coronary blood flowtwentysix people were studied for 1 year by using myocardial perfusion imaging mpi echocardiography echo and serial blood work to evaluate the extent of changes in regional coronary blood flow regional wall motion abnormalities and several independent variables known to be important in the development and progression of coronary artery diseasetreatment was based on homocysteine lp a creactive protein crp triglycerides total cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol very lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and fibrinogen levelseach variable was independently treated as previously reportedmpi and echo were performed at the beginning and end of the study for each individualthe 16 people treatment grouptg studied modified their dietary intake as instructedten additional individuals elected a different dietary regimen consisting of a highprotein high protein grouphpg diet which they believed would improve their overall healthpatients in the tg demonstrated a reduction in each of the independent variables studied with regression in both the extent and severity of coronary artery disease cad as quantitatively measured by mpirecovery of viable myocardium was seen in 4375 of myocardial segments in these patients documented with both mpi and echo evaluationsindividuals in the hpg showed worsening of their independent variablesmost notably fibrinogen lp a and crp increased by an average of 14 106 and 61 respectivelyprogression of the extent and severity of cad was documented in each of the vascular territories with an overall cumulative progression of 397the differences between progression and extension of disease in the hpg and the regression of disease in the tg were statistically p0001 significantpatients following recommended treatment for each of the independent variables were able to regress both the extent and severity of their coronary artery disease cad as well as improve their myocardial wall motion function while following the prescribed medical and dietary guidelineshowever individuals receiving the same medical treatment but following a highprotein diet showed a worsening of independent risk factors in addition to progression of cadthese results would suggest that highprotein diets may precipitate progression of cai through increases in lipid deposition and inflammatory and coagulation pathways
