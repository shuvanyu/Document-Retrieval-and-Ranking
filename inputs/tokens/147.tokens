mean hexachlorobenzene hcb and hexachlorocyclohexane hch concentrations measured in seawater and air samples confirmed the decline in levels of these compounds in antarctic air and waterhowever low alphagammahch ratios in air at the beginning of the sampling period suggest a predominance of fresh lindane entering the antarctic atmosphere during the austral spring probably due to current use in the southern hemispherewaterair fugacity ratios demonstrate the potential for hch gas deposition to coastal antarctic seas while the waterair fugacity ratios for hcb imply that volatilization does not account for the observed decrease of hcb in surface seawaterhch concentrations found in krill samples were correlated with seawater concentrations indicative of bioconcentration of hchs from seawater
