lowcarbohydrate diets have become increasingly popular for weight lossalthough they may improve some metabolic markers particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus t2d or the metabolic syndrome ms their net effect on arterial wall function remains unclearthe objective was to evaluate the relation between dietary macronutrient composition and the small artery reactive hyperaemia index sarhi a marker of small artery endothelial function in a cohort of patients at increased cardiovascular cv riskthe present crosssectional study included 247 patientsdiet was evaluated by a 3d foodintake register and reduced to a novel lowcarbohydrate diet score lcdsphysical examination demographic biochemical and anthropometry parameters were recorded and the sarhi was measured in each patientindividuals in the lowest lcds quartile q1 45  carbohydrate 20  protein 32  fat had higher sarhi values than those in the top quartile q4 29  carbohydrate 24  protein 40  fat 166 sd 041 v 152 sd 022 p 0037these results were particularly strong in patients with the ms q1  182 sd 032 v q4  161 sd 027 p 0021 and t2d q1  178 sd 031 v q4  162 sd 035 p 0011multivariate analysis demonstrated that individuals in the highest lcds quartile had a significantly negative coefficient of sarhi which was independent of confounders or 085 95  ci 019 092 p 0031these findings suggest that a dietary pattern characterised by a low amount of carbohydrate but high amounts of protein and fat is associated with a poorer small artery vascular reactivity in patients with increased cv risk
