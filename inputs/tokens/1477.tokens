death receptors belong to the tnf receptor family and are characterised by an intracellular death domain that serves to recruit adapter proteins such as tradd and fadd and cysteine proteases such as caspase8activation of caspase8 on the aggregated receptor leads to apoptosistriggering of death receptors is mediated through the binding of specific ligands of the tnf family which are homotrimeric type2 membrane proteins displaying three receptor binding sitesthere are various means of modulating the activation of death receptorsthe status of the ligand membranebound vs soluble is critical in the activation of fas and of trail receptorscleavage of membranebound fasl to a soluble form sfasl does not affect its ability to bind to fas but drastically decreases its cytotoxic activityconversely crosslinking epitopetagged sfasl with antitag antibodies to mimic membranebound ligand results in a 1000fold increase in cytotoxicitythis suggests that more than three fas molecules need to be aggregated to efficiently signal apoptosisdeath receptors can also be regulated by decoy receptorsthe cytotoxic ligand trail interacts with five receptors only two of which trailr1 and r2 have a death domaintrailr3 is anchored to the membrane by a glycolipid and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of trailmediated apoptosis when overexpressed on trailsensitive cellsintracellular proteins interacting with the apoptotic pathway are potential modulators of death receptorsflip resembles caspase8 in structure but lacks protease activityit interacts with both fadd and caspase8 to inhibits the apoptotic signal of death receptors and at the same time can activate other signalling pathways such as that leading to nfkappa b activation
