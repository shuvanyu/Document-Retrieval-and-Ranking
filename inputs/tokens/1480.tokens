in this study we investigated the molecular pathways targeted by curcumin during apoptosis of human melanoma cell lineswe found that curcumin caused cell death in eight melanoma cell lines four with wildtype and four with mutant p53we demonstrate that curcumininduced apoptosis is both dose and timedependentwe found that curcumin did not induce p53 suggesting that curcumin activates other apoptosis pathwaysour data show that curcumin activates caspases3 and 8 but not caspase9 supporting the rationale that apoptosis occurs via a membranemediated mechanismboth a caspase8 and broadbased caspase inhibitor but not a caspase9 specific inhibitor suppressed curcumininduced cell deathto further support our hypothesis that curcumin induces activation of a death receptor pathway we show that curcumin induces fas receptor aggregation in a faslindependent manner and that lowtemperature incubation previously shown to inhibit receptor aggregation prevented curcumininduced cell deathmoreover we demonstrate that expression of dominant negative fadd significantly inhibited curcumininduced cell deathin addition our results indicate that curcumin also blocks the nfkappab cell survival pathway and suppresses the apoptotic inhibitor xiapsince melanoma cells with mutant p53 are strongly resistant to conventional chemotherapy curcumin may overcome the chemoresistance of these cells and provide potential new avenues for treatment
