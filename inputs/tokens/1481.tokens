fasassociated protein with death domain fadd is the key adaptor protein transmitting apoptotic signals mediated by the main death receptors drsbesides being an essential instrument in cell death fadd is also implicated in proliferation cell cycle progression tumor development inflammation innate immunity and autophagyrecently many of these new functions of fadd were shown to be independent of drsmoreover fadd function is dictated by protein localization and phosphorylation statethus fadd is a crucial and unique controller of many essential cellular processesthe full understanding of the networks dictating the ultimate function of fadd may provide a new paradigm for other multifaceted proteinscopyright 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
