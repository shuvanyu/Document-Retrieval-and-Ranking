curcumin diferuloylmethane the yellow pigment in turmeric curcuma longa is known to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells by arresting them at various phases of the cell cycle and to induce apoptosis in tumor cellscurcumininduced apoptosis mainly involves the activation of caspase3 and mitochondriamediated pathway in various cancer cells of different tissue originin the present study the induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity by curcumin in colon cancer colo 205 cells was investigated by using flow cytometrythe results demonstrated that curcumin induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis dose and timedepedentlycurcumin induced the production of reactive oxygen species ros and ca2 decreased the levels of mitochondria membrane potential and induced caspase3 activitycurcumin also promoted the expression of bax cytochrome c p53 and p21 but inhibited the expression of bcl2these observations suggest that curcumin may have a possible therapeutic potential in colon cancer patients
