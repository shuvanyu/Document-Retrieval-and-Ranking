background food dyes synthesized originally from coal tar and now petroleum have long been controversial because of safety concernsmany dyes have been banned because of their adverse effects on laboratory animals or inadequate testingconclusions this review finds that all of the nine currently usapproved dyes raise health concerns of varying degreesred 3 causes cancer in animals and there is evidence that several other dyes also are carcinogenicthree dyes red 40 yellow 5 and yellow 6 have been found to be contaminated with benzidine or other carcinogensat least four dyes blue 1 red 40 yellow 5 and yellow 6 cause hypersensitivity reactionsnumerous microbiological and rodent studies of yellow 5 were positive for genotoxicitytoxicity tests on two dyes citrus red 2 and orange b also suggest safety concerns but citrus red 2 is used at low levels and only on some florida oranges and orange b has not been used for several yearsthe inadequacy of much of the testing and the evidence for carcinogenicity genotoxicity and hypersensitivity coupled with the fact that dyes do not improve the safety or nutritional quality of foods indicates that all of the currently used dyes should be removed from the food supply and replaced if at all by safer coloringsit is recommended that regulatory authorities require better and independent toxicity testing exercise greater caution regarding continued approval of these dyes and in the future approve only welltested safe dyes
