the incidence andor prevalence of health problems associated with endocrinedisruption have increasedmany chemicals have endocrinedisrupting properties including bisphenol a some organochlorines polybrominated flame retardants perfluorinated substances alkylphenols phthalates pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons alkylphenols solvents and some household products including some cleaning products air fresheners hair dyes cosmetics and sunscreenseven some metals were shown to have endocrinedisrupting propertiesmany observations suggesting that endocrine disruptors do contribute to cancer diabetes obesity the metabolic syndrome and infertility are listed in this paperan overview is presented of mechanisms contributing to endocrine disruptionendocrine disruptors can act through classical nuclear receptors but also through estrogenrelated receptors membranebound estrogenreceptors and interaction with targets in the cytosol resulting in activation of the srcraserk pathway or modulation of nitric oxidein addition changes in metabolism of endogenous hormones crosstalk between genomic and nongenomic pathways cross talk with estrogen receptors after binding on other receptors interference with feedback regulation and neuroendocrine cells changes in dna methylation or histone modifications and genomic instability by interference with the spindle figure can play a rolealso it was found that effects of receptor activation can differ in function of the ligand
