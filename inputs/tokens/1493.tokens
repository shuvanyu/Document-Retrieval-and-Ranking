alkylphenols are widely used as plastic additives and surfactantswe report the identification of an alkylphenol nonylphenol as an estrogenic substance released from plastic centrifuge tubesthis compound was extracted with methanol purified by flash chromatography and reversephase high performance liquid chromatography and identified by gas chromatographymass spectrometrynonylphenol induced both cell proliferation and progesterone receptor in human estrogensensitive mcf7 breast tumor cellsnonylphenol also triggered mitotic activity in rat endometrium this result confirms the reliability of the mcf7 cell proliferation bioassaythe estrogenic properties of alkylphenols specifically nonylphenols indicate that the use of plasticware containing these chemicals in experimental and diagnostic tests may lead to spurious results and these compounds as well as alkylphenol polyethoxylates may also be potentially harmful to exposed humans and the environment at large
