the development of the male reproductive ducts and external genitalia in vertebrates is dependent on elevated androgen concentrations during embryonic development and the period of postnatal growthwe have observed that a population of juvenile alligators living on lake apopka exhibit significantly smaller penis size 24 average decrease and lower plasma concentrations of testosterone 70 lower concentrations when compared to animals of similar size on lake woodruffin addition to smaller phalli no relationship exists between plasma testosterone concentrations and penile size in males from lake apopka whereas a positive relationship exists for males from lake woodruffthe alligators on lake apopka are known to have elevated concentrations of the antiandrogenic ddt breakdown product ppdde stored in their fatwe suggest a number of hypotheses that could explain the modification in the phenotype of the juvenile male living in lake apopkathese modifications in phenotype include a smaller penis size lower plasma androgen concentrations and lack of responsiveness of the penis to the plasma androgens present
