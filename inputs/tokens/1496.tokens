continuing evidence of the feminising effects of xenoestrogens on a range of wildlife species increases the need to assess the human health risk of these estrogen mimicswe have estimated the exposure of new zealand males females and young men to a range of naturally occurring and synthetic xenoestrogens found in foodonly estrogenic compounds that act by interaction with the estrogen receptor have been includedtheoretical plasma estrogen activity levels were derived from estrogen exposure estimates and estrogenic potency datatheoretical plasma levels were compared with published data for specific xenoestrogensthere was surprisingly close agreementxenoestrogenicity from dietary intake was almost equally attributed to naturally occurring and synthetic xenoestrogensrelative contributions for a male for example were isoflavones genistein and daidzein 36 and bisphenol a 34 with smaller contributions from alkyl phenols 18 and the flavonoids phloretin and kaempferol 12it is suggested that dietary xenoestrogens might have a pharmacological effect on new zealand males and postmenopausal women but are unlikely to be significant for premenopausal women
