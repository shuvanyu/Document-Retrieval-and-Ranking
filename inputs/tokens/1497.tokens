the aim of this study was to compare results obtained by eight different shortterm assays of estrogenlike actions of chemicals conducted in 10 different laboratories in five countriestwenty chemicals were selected to represent directacting estrogens compounds with estrogenic metabolites estrogenic antagonists and a known cytotoxic agentalso included in the test panel were 17betaestradiol as a positive control and ethanol as solvent controlthe test compounds were coded before distributiontest methods included direct binding to the estrogen receptor er proliferation of mcf7 cells transient reporter gene expression in mcf7 cells reporter gene expression in yeast strains stably transfected with the human er and an estrogenresponsive reporter gene and vitellogenin production in juvenile rainbow trout17betaestradiol 17alphaethynyl estradiol and diethylstilbestrol induced a strong estrogenic response in all test systemscolchicine caused cytotoxicity onlybisphenol a induced an estrogenic response in all assaysthe results obtained for the remaining test compoundstamoxifen ici 182780 testosterone bisphenol a dimethacrylate 4noctylphenol 4nnonylphenol nonylphenol dodecylethoxylate butylbenzylphthalate dibutylphthalate methoxychlor opddt ppdde endosulfan chlomequat chloride and ethanolvaried among the assaysthe results demonstrate that careful standardization is necessary to obtain a reasonable degree of reproducibilityalso similar methods vary in their sensitivity to estrogenic compoundsthus shortterm tests are useful for screening purposes but the methods must be further validated by additional interlaboratory and interassay comparisons to document the reliability of the methods
