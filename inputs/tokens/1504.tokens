background broad dietary patterns have been linked to asthma but the relative contribution of specific nutrients is unclearsoy genistein has important antiinflammatory and other biological effects that might be beneficial in asthmaa positive association was previously reported between soy genistein intake and lung function but not with asthma exacerbationsaims to conduct a posthoc analysis of patients with inadequately controlled asthma enrolled in a prospective multicentre clinical trial to replicate this associationmethods a total of 300 study participants were included in the analysisdietary soy genistein intake was measured using the block soy foods screenerthe level of soy genistein intake little or no intake moderate intake or high intake was compared with baseline lung function prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second fev1 and asthma control proportion of participants with an episode of poor asthma control epac and annualised rates of epacs over a 6month followup periodresults participants with little or no genistein intake had a lower baseline fev1 than those with a moderate or high intake 226l vs 253l and 247l respectively p001epacs were more common among those with no genistein intake than in those with a moderate or high intake 54 vs 35 vs 40 respectively p0001these findings remained significant after adjustment for patient demographics and body mass indexconclusions in patients with asthma consumption of a diet with moderate to high amounts of soy genistein is associated with better lung function and better asthma control
