this paper presents the results of an investigation on the occurrence of alkylphenols aps and their ethoxylates apes in 8 edible marine species from the adriatic sea and tries to estimate the corresponding intake for the italian populationtwo crustaceans nephrops norvegicus norway lobster and squilla mantis spottail mantis shrimp plus six fish species engraulis enchrascicolus anchovy scomber scombrus atlantic mackerel merluccius merluccius european hake mullus barbatus red mullet solea vulgaris common sole and lophius piscatorius angler were analyzed for their content of nonylphenol np octylphenol op and octylphenol polyethoxylates opesthese compounds were found in all analysed samplesnp was detected at the highest concentrations 118399 and 951431 ng g1 fresh weight fw respectively in crustaceans and fishop was found at respective levels of 2747 and 0338 ng g1 fw in crustaceans and fish whereas ope was determined at respective concentrations of 12168 and 02211 ng g1 fw in the same speciesthese results together with those from a previous study on 4 edible mollusc allow to estimate respective daily intakes for np op and ope of about 12 01 and 01 microg day1 for an italian adult living along the adriatic coastin relation to np and op these intakes are much lower than the doses associated with toxic effects in laboratory animals 9 mg kg1 bw for ratsnevertheless data of exposure from other sources to these chemicals and others with similar biological characteristics are needed
