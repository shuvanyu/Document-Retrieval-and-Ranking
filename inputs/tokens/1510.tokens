a human breast cancer cell line mcf7 was used to develop an in vitro screening assay for the detection of xenoestrogenic environmental pollutantsmcf7 cells were cultured in dmem containing 5 fetal bovine serum fbsan estrogenic response was defined as an increase in the frequency of proliferating mcf7 cells and was measured using a thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine and flow cytometrydi2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and 4nnonylphenol 4nnp were used as model chemicalsthe proliferation rate of sphase cells after 24 h of exposure to various concentrations of 17betaestradiol and to model compounds was compared with a positive and a negative control containing 1 nm 17betaestradiol and 01 ethanol respectivelydehp and 4nnp increased the frequency of proliferating mcf7 cells in a dosedependent mannerthe lowest concentration that significantly increased the proliferation of mcf7 cells was 10 microm for dehp and 1 microm for 4nnpthe results showed that the assay is accurate and quick to performit may prove a valuable tool for screening potential estrogenmimicking environmental pollutants
