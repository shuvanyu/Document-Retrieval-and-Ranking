in the 21st century human aging will be one of the biggest challenges for most societies throughout the worldthe decline in human fitness is a typical hallmark of the aging processaside from the cardiovascular system the brain most often suffers significantly from the lifelong impact of stressors such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen speciesoxytosis ieoxidative stressinduced cell death has been identified to play a major role in the development and onset of chronic diseasesfoods especially of plant origin are rich in antioxidants and numerous in vivo data suggest that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables supports the maintenance of animal and human healththese beneficial effects also extend to the central nervous system which due to the presence of the bloodbrain barrier tightly controls the influx of metabolites and nutrientsin earlier studies the impact of antioxidant vitamins such as alphatocopherol and ascorbic acid on brain health has been of interestrecently the focus moved to assessing the potential of unsaturated fatty acids and secondary plant metabolites particularly of polyphenols to act as neuroprotectantsconsiderable experimental evidence suggests that polyphenols and other plantderived bioactivities affect animal and human brain function not only by directly lowering oxidative stress load but also by modulating various signal transduction pathways
