objective berries are high in flavonoids especially anthocyanidins and improve cognition in experimental studieswe prospectively evaluated whether greater longterm intakes of berries and flavonoids are associated with slower rates of cognitive decline in older womenmethods beginning in 1980 a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered every four years to nurses health study participantsin 19952001 we began measuring cognitive function in 16010 participants aged 70 years followup assessments were conducted twice at twoyear intervalsto ascertain longterm diet we averaged dietary variables from 1980 through the initial cognitive interviewusing multivariableadjusted mixed linear regression we estimated mean differences in slopes of cognitive decline by longterm berry and flavonoid intakesresults greater intakes of blueberries and strawberries were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline eg for a global score averaging all six cognitive tests for blueberries ptrend0014 and mean difference004 95 ci001 007 comparing extreme categories of intake for strawberries ptrend 0022 and mean difference003 95 ci000 006 comparing extreme categories of intake after adjusting for multiple potential confoundersthese effect estimates were equivalent to those we find for approximately 15 to 25 years of age in our cohort indicating that berry intake appears to delay cognitive aging by up to 25 yearsadditionally in further supporting evidence greater intakes of anthocyanidins and total flavonoids were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline ptrends 0015 and 0053 respectively for the global scoreinterpretation higher intake of flavonoids particularly from berries appears to reduce rates of cognitive decline in older adults
