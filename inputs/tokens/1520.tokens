transglutaminase is an enzyme that can be used to crosslink pieces of meat fish or meat productsthe resulting product gives the optical impression of an intact chunk of meatthe usage of transglutaminase as a food additive is permitted in some countrieshowever its utilisation has to be declared to ensure transparency for consumersthis paper describes two orthogonal analytical methods suited for the detection of technological relevant transglutaminase concentrations around 25 mg pure enzyme in 1 kg of product in meat and meat productsthe mass spectrometrybased approach relies on a previous digestion with achromobacter lyticus protease and lcmsms separation and detectionsufficient selectivity was obtained by monitoring four different peptidesthe orthogonal complementary and independent elisabased approach relies on two commercially available bacterial transglutaminasespecific antibodies combined to a sandwich elisathe two methods were tested by analysing some 60 samples obtained from the market
