although products of pyrolysis are often cytotoxic and mutagenic the relationship between the type of material pyrolysed and the toxicity of the resulting pyrolysis products is poorly understoodthe objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of several types of common pyrolysis productsthe cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of these products were assessed by using neutral red uptake and ames mutagenicity assays respectivelythe biological activities of four liquid smoke food flavourings lsf were compared with two other pyrolysisderived materials cigarette smoke condensate csc and a wood smoke condensate wscresults indicated all of the mixtures exhibited a concentrationdependent cytotoxic responsethe csc and wsc were less cytotoxic than three of the lsfs but more cytotoxic than one of the brandsthe csc was mutagenic in two salmonella strains however none of the lsfs or wsc was mutagenic using ta98 and only three of the lsfs were positive with ta100the six pyrolysisderived materials evaluated in this study showed differing patterns and magnitudes of cytotoxicity and mutagenicitythese results indicate that the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of complex mixtures derived from pyrolysis products are affected by the type of material pyrolysed andor the method used to prepare the mixturethe cytotoxic potential of some commercial smoke flavourings is greater than cigarette smoke condensate and several of the food flavourings are mutagenic in one salmonella strain
