antioxidants primarily from fruits and vegetables have been hypothesized to protect against nonhodgkin lymphoma nhlthe oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac assay which measures total antioxidant capacity of individual foods and accounts for synergism can be estimated using a foodfrequency questionnaire ffqwe tested the hypothesis that higher intake of antioxidant nutrients from foods supplements and ffqbased orac values are associated with a lower risk of nhl in a clinicbased study of 603 incident cases and 1007 frequencymatched controlsdiet was assessed with a 128item ffqlogistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals adjusted for age sex residence and total energydietary intake of αtocopherol or050 ptrend00002 βcarotene or058 ptrend00005 luteinzeaxanthin or062 ptrend0005 zinc or054 ptrend0003 and chromium or068 ptrend0032 were inversely associated with nhl riskinclusion of supplement use had little impact on these associationstotal vegetables or052 ptrend00001 particularly green leafy or052 ptrend00001 and cruciferous or068 ptrend0045 vegetables were inversely associated with nhl risknhl risk was inversely associated with both hydrophilic orac or061 ptrend0003 and lipophilic orac or048 ptrend00002 although after simultaneous adjustment for other antioxidants or total vegetables only the association for lipophilic orac remained significantthere was no striking heterogeneity in results across the common nhl subtypeshigher antioxidant intake as estimated by the ffqorac particularly the lipophilic component was associated with a lower nhl risk after accounting for other antioxidant nutrients and vegetable intake supporting this as potentially useful summary measure of total antioxidant intake
