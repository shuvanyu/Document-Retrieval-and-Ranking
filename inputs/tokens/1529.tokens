background there are no previous studies investigating the effect of all dietary antioxidants in relation to myocardial infarctionthe total antioxidant capacity of diet takes into account all antioxidants and synergistic effects between themthe aim of this study was to examine how total antioxidant capacity of diet and antioxidantcontaining foods were associated with incident myocardial infarction among middleaged and elderly womenmethods in the populationbased prospective swedish mammography cohort of 4983yearold women 32561 were cardiovascular diseasefree at baselinewomen completed a foodfrequency questionnaire and dietary total antioxidant capacity was calculated using oxygen radical absorbance capacity valuesinformation on myocardial infarction was identified from the swedish hospital discharge and the cause of death registrieshazard ratios hr and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated using cox proportional hazard modelsresults during the followup september 1997december 2007 we identified 1114 incident cases of myocardial infarction 321434 personyearsin multivariableadjusted analysis the hr for women comparing the highest quintile of dietary total antioxidant capacity to the lowest was 080 95 ci 067097 p for trend002servings of fruit and vegetables and whole grains were nonsignificantly inversely associated with myocardial infarctionconclusions these data suggest that dietary total antioxidant capacity based on fruits vegetables coffee and whole grains is of importance in the prevention of myocardial infarctioncopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
