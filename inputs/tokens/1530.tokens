a high intake of dietary antioxidant compounds has been hypothesized to be an appropriate strategy to reduce gastric cancer gc developmentwe investigated the effect of dietary total antioxidant capacity tac in relation to gc in the european prospective investigation into cancer epic study including 23 centers in 10 european countriesa total of 521457 subjects 153447 men aged mostly 3570 years old were recruited largely between 1992 and 1998ferric reducing antioxidant potential frap and total radicaltrapping antioxidant parameter trap measuring reducing and chainbreaking antioxidant capacity were used to measure dietary tac from plant foodsdietary antioxidant intake is associated with a reduction in the risk of gc for both frap adjusted hr 066 95ci 046095 and trap adjusted hr 061 95ci 043087 highest vs lowest quintilethe association was observed for both cardia and noncardia cancersa clear effect was observed in smokers with a significant reduction in gc risk for the fifth quintile of intake for both assays highest vs lowest quintile adjusted hr 041 95ci 022076 p for trend 0001 for frap adjusted hr 052 95ci 028097 p for trend 0001 for trap but not in nonsmokersin former smokers the association with frap intake was statistically significant highest vs lowest quintile adjusted hr 04 95ci 021075 p  005 no association was observed for trapdietary antioxidant capacity intake from different sources of plant foods is associated with a reduction in the risk of gccopyright  2011 uicc
