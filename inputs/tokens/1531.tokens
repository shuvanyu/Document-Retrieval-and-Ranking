objectives the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that intake of used cooking fat is associated with impaired endothelial functionbackground diets containing high levels of lipid oxidation products may accelerate atherogenesis but the effect on endothelial function is unknownmethods flowmediated endotheliumdependent dilation and glyceryl trinitrateinduced endotheliumindependent dilation of the brachial artery were investigated in 10 mensubjects had arterial studies before and 4 h after three test meals 1 a meal fat 644 g rich in cooking fat that had been used for deep frying in a fast food restaurant 2 the same meal fat 644 g rich in unused cooking fat and 3 a corresponding low fat meal fat 184 g without added fatresults endotheliumdependent dilation decreased between fasting and postprandial studies after the used fat meal 59  23 vs 08  22 p  00003 but there was no significant change after the unused fat meal 53  21 vs 60  25 or low fat meal 53  23 vs 54  33there was no significant difference in endotheliumindependent dilation after any of the mealsplasma free fatty acid concentration did not change significantly during any of the mealsthe level of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia was not associated with change in endothelial functionconclusions ingestion of a meal rich in fat previously used for deep frying in a commercial fast food restaurant resulted in impaired arterial endothelial functionthese findings suggest that intake of degradation products of heated fat contribute to endothelial dysfunction
