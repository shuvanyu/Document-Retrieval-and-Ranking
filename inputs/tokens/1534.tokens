blood components especially hemoglobin are powerful promoters of lipid oxidation and may decrease the shelf life of meat productstherefore this study examined different slaughter techniques to determine their effects on ph 24 h color lab values at 24 h lipid oxidation residual hemoglobin concentration 24 h and sensory evaluation d 1 and 4 postmortem pm in broiler breast filletsthe treatments included 1 co2 slaughter and not bled 2 no stunning and bled 3 electrical stunning es and bled 4 co2 stunning and bled and 5 es and decapitationthe birds were conventionally processed and analyses were performed at 24 h pm except residual hemoglobin for which the samples were frozen 80 degrees c until analyses   2 mothere were no significant differences in ph or b values at 24 h pm among any of the treatmentsl values were significantly higher indicating lighter fillets in the es and decapitated birds compared with the darker fillets from the co2 stunned and bled birdsthe co2 slaughter and not bled birds had significantly higher a values indicating more red color when compared with the es and bled and decapitated birdsthere were no significant differences in the residual hemoglobin contents in the broiler breast muscle when comparing all of the treatments except co2 slaughter and not bled which was significantly around 15 greateroverall tbareactive substances tbars raw cooked at 24 h and cooked at 72 h pm indicated that es and bled birds had the lowest tbars when compared with the remaining treatmentsconsumer panels detected increased aroma chicken meaty and warmedover aromas and flavor chicken meaty and warmedover flavors in not bled samples at 24 h pmby 72 h pm however there were no significant differences in aroma or flavortherefore different slaughter and bleeding method may affect color and sensory properties of the broiler breast fillets and the es and decapitation method had the most favorable results for sensory quality
