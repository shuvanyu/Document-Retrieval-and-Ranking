background oxidative stress can cause cancerour aim was to establish whether antioxidant supplements reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer and mortalitymethods with the cochrane collaboration methodology we reviewed all randomised trials comparing antioxidant supplements with placebo for prevention of gastrointestinal cancerswe searched electronic databases and reference lists february 2003outcome measures were incidence of gastrointestinal cancers overall mortality and adverse effectsoutcomes were analysed with fixedeffect and randomeffects model metaanalyses and were reported as relative risk with 95 cisfindings we identified 14 randomised trials n170525trial quality was generally highheterogeneity of results was low to moderateneither the fixedeffect relative risk 096 95 ci 088104 nor randomeffects metaanalyses 090 077105 showed significant effects of supplementation with betacarotene vitamins a c e and selenium alone or in combination versus placebo on oesophageal gastric colorectal pancreatic and liver cancer incidencesin seven highquality trials n131727 the fixedeffect model showed that antioxidant significantly increased mortality 106 102110 unlike the randomeffects metaanalysis 106 098115lowquality trials showed no significant effect of antioxidant supplementation on mortalitythe difference between the mortality estimates in highquality and lowquality trials was significant z210 p004 by test of interactionbetacarotene and vitamin a 129 114145 and betacarotene and vitamin e 110 101120 significantly increased mortality whereas betacarotene alone only tended to increase mortality 105 099111in four trials three with unclear or inadequate methodology selenium showed significant beneficial effect on the incidence of gastrointestinal cancerinterpretation we could not find evidence that antioxidant supplements can prevent gastrointestinal cancers on the contrary they seem to increase overall mortalitythe potential preventive effect of selenium should be studied in adequate randomised trials
