we assess the evidence for health benefits of three commonly consumed plant food supplements pfs green tea isoflavone and aloe vera based on published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials rctswhilst the potential benefits of green tea have been reported in a wide range of health areas it is only in the area of the metabolic syndrome that the number of rcts is approaching sufficient to judge such efficacyisoflavone supplements are widely used and rcts indicate that they affect bone resorption at lower doses in postmenopausal women undergoing estrogenrelated bone loss but this is only translated to attenuation of bone loss at higher doses of isoflavonesa systematic review on rcts concluded that the effects of isoflavones on hot flashes in postmenopausal women were highly variable and no conclusions could be drawndespite the popularity of aloe vera as a pfs the evaluation of its efficacy as a coadjuvant therapy for certain metabolic or digestive pathologies remains scarce it constitutes a typical example of a naturally occurring ingredient whose efficacy in topical applications presupposes its efficacy in systemic applicationsnevertheless its possible toxic effects on oral consumption call for caution in its utility as a pfssince 2007 efficacy evaluation of pfs in europe has been covered by european union nutrition and health claims legislationthe european food safety authority has adopted an approach relying on rcts while medicinal effects are accepted based on traditional usein general there are insufficient rcts for claims to be made and conclusive results on pfs should be obtained in the future by conducting studies with more homogeneous populations by using supplements with optimised and measured bioavailability and by conducting larger rcts
