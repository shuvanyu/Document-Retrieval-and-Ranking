objective obesity results from protracted energy imbalancewhether this comprises excessive energy intake lowered physical activity or both remains disputeddesign physical activity energy expenditure evaluated in three different ways from daily energy expenditure dee measured using doubly labelled water was examined for trends over timedata included subjects in europe maastricht the netherlands and north america extending back to the 1980sthese data were compared with measures from the third world and measures made on wild terrestrial mammalsresults physical activity expenditure in europe residual of the regression of dee on basal energy expenditure bee has slightly but significantly increased since the 1980sthere was no trend over time in physical activity level paldeebee or in the residual variance in dee once mass sex and age were accounted forthis latter index of physical activity expenditure also significantly increased over time in north americadee of individuals in europe and north america was not significantly different from individuals measured in the third worldin wild terrestrial mammals dee mostly depended on body mass and ambient temperaturepredicted dee for a 78 kg mammal living at 20 degrees c was 92 mj per day 95 ci 79129 mj per day not significantly different from the measured dee of modern humans around 102126 mj per dayconclusion as physical activity expenditure has not declined over the same period that obesity rates have increased dramatically and daily energy expenditure of modern man is in line with energy expenditure in wild mammals it is unlikely that decreased expenditure has fuelled the obesity epidemic
