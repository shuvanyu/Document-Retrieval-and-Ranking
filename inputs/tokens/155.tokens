background irritable bowel syndrome ibs is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorderthe role of pharmacotherapy for ibs is limited and focused mainly on symptom controlobjectives the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents antispasmodics and antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndromesearch strategy computer assisted structured searches of medline embase the cochrane library cinahl and psychinfo were conducted for the years 19662009an updated search in april 2011 identified 10 studies which will be considered for inclusion in a future update of this reviewselection criteria randomized controlled trials comparing bulking agents antispasmodics or antidepressants with a placebo treatment in patients with irritable bowel syndrome aged over 12 years were considered for inclusiononly studies published as full papers were includedstudies were not excluded on the basis of languagethe primary outcome had to include improvement of abdominal pain global assessment or symptom scoredata collection and analysis two authors independently extracted data from the selected studiesrisk ratios rr and standardized mean differences smd with 95 confidence intervals ci were calculateda proof of practice analysis was conducted including subgroup analyses for different types of  bulking agents spasmolytic agents or antidepressant medicationthis was followed by a proof of principle analysis where only the studies with adequate allocation concealment were includedmain results a total of 56 studies 3725 patients were included in this reviewthese included 12 studies of bulking agents 621 patients 29 of antispasmodics 2333 patients and 15 of antidepressants 922 patientsthe risk of bias was low for most itemshowever selection bias is unclear for many of the included studies because the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment were not describedno beneficial effect for bulking agents over placebo was found for improvement of abdominal pain 4 studies 186 patients smd 003 95 ci 034 to 040 p  087 global assessment 11 studies 565 patients rr 110 95 ci 091 to 133 p  032 or symptom score 3 studies 126 patients smd 000 95 ci 043 to 043 p  100subgroup analyses for insoluble and soluble fibres also showed no statistically significant benefitseparate analysis of the studies with adequate concealment of allocation did not change these resultsthere was a beneficial effect for antispasmodics over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain 58 of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 46 of placebo 13 studies 1392 patients rr 132 95 ci 112 to 155 p  0001 nnt  7 global assessment 57 of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 39 of placebo 22 studies 1983 patients rr 149 95 ci 125 to 177 p  00001 nnt  5 and symptom score 37 of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 22 of placebo 4 studies 586 patients rr 186 95 ci 126 to 276 p  001 nnt  3subgroup analyses for different types of antispasmodics found statistically significant benefits for cimteropium dicyclomine peppermint oil pinaverium and trimebutineseparate analysis of the studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for improvement of abdominal painthere was a beneficial effect for antidepressants over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain 54 of antidepressants patients improved compared to 37 of placebo 8 studies 517 patients rr 149 95 ci 105 to 212 p  003 nnt  5 global assessment 59 of antidepressants patients improved compared to 39 of placebo 11 studies 750 patients rr 157 95 ci 123 to 200 p  0001 nnt  4 and symptom score 53 of antidepressants patients improved compared to 26 of placebo 3 studies 159 patients rr 199 95 ci 132 to 299 p  0001 nnt  4subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant benefit for selective serotonin releasing inhibitors ssris for improvement of  global assessment and for tricyclic antidepressants tcas for improvement of abdominal pain and symptom scoreseparate analysis of studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for improvement of symptom score and global assessmentadverse events were not assessed as an outcome in this reviewauthors conclusions there is no evidence that bulking agents are effective for treating ibsthere is evidence that antispasmodics are effective for the treatment of ibsthe individual subgroups which are effective include cimetropiumdicyclomine peppermint oil pinaverium and trimebutinethere is good evidence that antidepressants are effective for the treatment of ibsthe subgroup analyses for ssris and tcas are unequivocal and their effectiveness may depend on the individual patientfuture research should use rigorous methodology and valid outcome measures
