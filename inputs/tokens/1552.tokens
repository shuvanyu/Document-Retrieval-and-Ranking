summary weight loss resulting from an exercise intervention tends to be lower than predictedmodest weight loss can arise from an increase in energy intake physiological reductions in resting energy expenditure an increase in lean tissue or a decrease in nonexercise activitylower than expected weight loss could also arise from weak and invalidated assumptions within predictive modelsto investigate these causes we systematically reviewed studies that monitored compliance to exercise prescriptions and measured exerciseinduced change in body compositionchanged body energy stores were calculated to determine the deficit between total daily energy intake and energy expendituresthis information combined with available measurements was used to critically evaluate explanations for low exerciseinduced weight losswe conclude that the small magnitude of weight loss observed from the majority of evaluated exercise interventions is primarily due to low doses of prescribed exercise energy expenditures compounded by a concomitant increase in caloric intake
