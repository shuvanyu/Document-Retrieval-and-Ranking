campylobacter represents the leading cause of gastroenteritis in europecampylobacteriosis is mainly due to c jejuni and c colipoultry meat is the main source of contamination and crosscontaminations in the consumers kitchen appear to be the important route for exposurethe aim of this study was to examine the transfer of campylobacter from naturally contaminated raw poultry products to a cooked chicken product via the cutting board and to determine the characteristics of the involved isolatesthis study showed that transfer occurred in nearly 30 of the assays and that both the c jejuni and c coli species were able to transfertransfer seems to be linked to specific isolates some were able to transfer during separate trials while others were notno correlation was found between transfer and adhesion to inert surfaces but more than 90 of the isolates presented moderate or high adhesion abilityall tested isolates had the ability to adhere and invade caco2 cells but presented high variability between isolatesour results highlighted the occurrence of campylobacter crosscontamination via the cutting board in the kitchenmoreover they provided new interesting data to be considered in risk assessment studiescopyright  2013 elsevier bv all rights reserved
