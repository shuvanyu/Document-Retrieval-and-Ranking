although survey results measuring the safety of consumers food handling and risky food consumption practices have been published for over 20 years evaluation of trends is impossible because the designs of published studies are not comparablethe food safety surveys used comparable methods to interview us adults by telephone in 1988 1993 2001 2006 and 2010 about food handling ie crosscontamination prevention and risky consumption practices eating raw or undercooked foods from animals and perceived risk from foodborne illnesssample sizes ranged from 1620 to 4547responses were analyzed descriptively and four indices measuring meat chicken and egg crosscontamination fish crosscontamination risky consumption and risk perceptions were analyzed using generalized linear modelsthe extent of media coverage of food safety issues was also examinedwe found a substantial improvement in food handling and consumption practices and an increase in perceived risk from foodborne illness between 1993 and 1998all indices were stable or declined between 1998 and 2006between 2006 and 2010 the two safe food handling practice indices increased significantly but risk perceptions did not change and safe consumption declinedwomen had safer food handling and consumption practices than menthe oldest and youngest respondents and those with the highest education had the least safe food handling behaviorschanges in safety of practices over the survey years are consistent with the change in the number of media stories about food safety in the periods between surveysthis finding suggests that increased media attention to food safety issues may raise awareness of food safety hazards and increase vigilance in food handling by consumers
