foods prepared in the kitchen can become crosscontaminated with campylobacter by contacting raw products particularly skinned poultrywe measured the percent transfer rate from naturally contaminated poultry legs purchased in supermarketstransfer of campylobacter from skin n  43 and from meat n  12 to highdensity polyethylene cutting board surfaces was quantitatively assessed after contact times of 1 and 10 minthe percent transfer rate was defined as the ratio between the number of campylobacter cells counted on the cutting board surface and the initial numbers of campylobacter naturally present on the skin ie the sum of campylobacter cells on the skin and boardqualitative transfer occurred in 605 95 confidence interval 455 to 754 of the naturally contaminated legs studied and reached 806 95 confidence interval 630 to 982 in the subpopulation of legs that were in contact with the surface for 10 minthe percent transfer rate varied from 5 x 102 to 357 and was observed as being significantly different kruskallwallis test p  0025 and inversely related to the initial counts on poultry skinthis study provides quantitative data describing the evolution of the proportion of campylobacter organisms transferred from naturally contaminated poultry under kitchen conditionswe emphasize the linear relationship between the initial load of campylobacter on the skin and the value of the percent transfer ratethis work confirms the need for modeling transfer as a function of initial load of campylobacter on leg skin the weight of poultry pieces and the duration of contact between the skin and surface
