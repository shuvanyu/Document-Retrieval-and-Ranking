the consumption of fresh produce is frequently associated with outbreaks of human norovirus hnov diseaseto prevent the contamination of fresh produce with hnov knowledge of the possible introduction sources of the viruses such as water is needed to be able to implement appropriate and efficient preventive measurescontaminated water used to reconstitute pesticides could be a relevant source of infectious hnov determined by the initial level of virus contamination and the persistence of these viruses in reconstituted pesticideswe studied the persistence of hnov gi4 hnov gii4 and murine norovirus mnv1 the only culturable norovirus in eight different pesticides after 0 and 2hvirus concentrations were determined by reverse transcriptase pcr and infectivity of mnv1 was determined by endpoint dilutions followed by maximum likelihood estimationsmnv1 was found to remain infectious in seven of the eight tested pesticides at the highest concentration applied in practicein the presence of the insecticide vertimec mnv1 infectivity decreased rapidly with a 19 log10unit reduction at timepoint t0also the concentration of nov gi4 rna decreased considerably with a 17 log10unit reduction whereas the detected pcr fragment of hnov gii4 remained stableassuming a similar persistence of infectious mnv1 and hnov we can conclude that water containing hnov used to dilute pesticides may be an important source of infectious hnov in fresh produce chainsthe application of pesticides may therefore not only be a chemical hazard but also a microbiological hazard for public healththe inclusion of antiviral substances in reconstituted pesticides may be appropriate to reduce the virological health risk posed by the application of pesticidescopyright  2012 elsevier bv all rights reserved
