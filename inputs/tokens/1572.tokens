objective to see whether mortality among men with angina can be reduced by dietary advicedesign a randomized controlled factorial trialsetting male patients of general practitioners in south walessubjects a total of 3114 men under 70 y of age with anginainterventions subjects were randomly allocated to four groups 1 advised to eat two portions of oily fish each week or to take three fish oil capsules daily 2 advised to eat more fruit vegetables and oats 3 given both the above types of advice and 4 given no specific dietary advicemortality was ascertained after 39 yresults compliance was better with the fish advice than with the fruit adviceallcause mortality was not reduced by either form of advice and no other effects were attributable to fruit advicerisk of cardiac death was higher among subjects advised to take oily fish than among those not so advised the adjusted hazard ratio was 126 95 confidence interval 100 158 p0047 and even greater for sudden cardiac death 154 95 ci 106 223 p0025the excess risk was largely located among the subgroup given fish oil capsulesthere was no evidence that it was due to interactions with medicationconclusions advice to eat more fruit was poorly complied with and had no detectable effect on mortalitymen advised to eat oily fish and particularly those supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher risk of cardiac deaththis result is unexplained it may arise from risk compensation or some other effect on patients or doctors behaviour
