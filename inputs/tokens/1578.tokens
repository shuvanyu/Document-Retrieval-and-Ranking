background fish consumption and omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa intake are shown to protect from cardiovascular diseases cvdhowever most fish contain environmental contaminants such as dibenzopdioxins and dibenzofurans pcddfs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and methylmercury mehg that may have adverse effects on cardiovascular healthobjective our aim was to elucidate the associations of fish consumption omega3 pufas environmental contaminants with lowgrade inflammation early atherosclerosis and traditional cvd risk factorsmethods the health 2000 survey participants n1173 represented the general finnish population and the fishermen study participants n255 represented a population with high fish consumption and high exposure to environmental contaminantsmodeladjusted geometric means and tests for linear trend were calculated for cvd risk factors by tertiles of fish consumption and serum omega3 pufas and additionally in the fishermen study only by tertiles of serum pcddfpcb and blood mehgresults serum triglyceride decreased across omega3 pufa tertiles in both sexes and studiesinsulin resistance creactive protein tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 6 decreased across omega3 pufa tertiles among the health 2000 survey participantsamong the fishermen study men insulin resistance and arterial stiffness indicated by βstiffness index tended to increase and the rr estimate for carotid artery plaque tended to decrease across tertiles of pcddfpcb and mehgconclusion previously established hypotriglyceridemic and antiinflammatory effects of omega3 pufas were seen also in this studythe hypothesised favourable effect on insulin sensitivity and arterial elasticity was suggested to be counteracted by high exposure to environmental contaminants but the effect on plaque prevalence appeared not to be harmfulcopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
