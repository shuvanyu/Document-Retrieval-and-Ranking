we have previously found a positive association between milk consumption and prostate cancer risk using metaanalysis to analyze published casecontrol studiesin the present study further metaanalysis was conducted to estimate the summary relative risk rr between the consumption of milk and dairy products and prostate cancer from cohort studies published between 1966 2006we found 18 relevant articles and 13 independent studies were available for our analysisthe summary rr was 113 95 confidence interval  102124 when comparing the highest with the lowest quantile of consumptionthe summary rrs by study stratification showed a positive associationa doseresponse relationship was identified when combining the studies that partitioned the consumption by quintileswe also evaluated the effects of some limitations such as dairy classification prostate cancer stages and publication bias in the present studythese findings together with the previous study suggest that the consumption of milk and dairy products increases the risk of prostate cancerthis is biologically plausible since milk contains considerable amounts of fat hormones and calcium that are associated with prostate cancer risk
