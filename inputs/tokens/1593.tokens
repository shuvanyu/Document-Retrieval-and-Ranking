the incidence and mortality rates of testicular and prostatic cancers in 42 countries were correlated with the dietary practices in these countries using the cancer rates 198892 provided by the international agency for research on cancer iarc and the food supply data 196190 provided by the food and agriculture organization faoamong the food items we examined cheese was most closely correlated with the incidence of testicular cancer at ages 2039 followed by animal fats and milkthe correlation coefficient r was highest r  0804 when calculated for cheese consumed during the period 196165 maternal or prepubertal consumptionstepwisemultipleregression analysis revealed that milk  cheese 196165 made a significant contribution to the incidence of testicular cancer standardized regression coefficient r  0654concerning prostatic cancer milk 196190 was most closely correlated r  0711 with its incidence followed by meat and coffeestepwisemultipleregression analysis identified milk  cheese as a factor contributing to the incidence of prostatic cancer r  0525the food that was most closely correlated with the mortality rate of prostatic cancer was milk r  0766 followed by coffee cheese and animal fatsstepwisemultipleregression analysis revealed that milk  cheese was a factor contributing to mortality from prostatic cancer r  0580the results of our study suggest a role of milk and dairy products in the development and growth of testicular and prostatic cancersthe close correlation between cheese and testicular cancer and between milk and prostatic cancer suggests that further mechanistic studies should be undertaken concerning the development of male genital organ cancerscopyright 2001 wileyliss inc
