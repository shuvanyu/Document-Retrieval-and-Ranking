our previous study demonstrated that curcumin an active compound of curcuma xanthorrhiza and c domestica produces a positive cholekinetic effecta 20 mg amount of curcumin is capable of contracting the gall bladder by up to 29 within an observation time of 2 h the aim of the current study was to define the dosage of curcumin capable of producing a 50 contraction of the gall bladder and to determine if there is a linear relationship between doubling the curcumin dosage and the doubling of gall bladder contractiona randomised singleblind threephase crossoverdesigned examination was carried out on 12 healthy volunteersultrasonography was carried out serially to measure the gall bladder volumethe data obtained was analysed by analysis of variance anovathe fasting volumes of gall bladders were similar p  050 with 1728  547 ml for 20 mg curcumin 1834  375 ml for 40 mg and 1824  372 ml for 80 mgthe percentage decrease in gall bladder volume 2 h after administration of 20 40 and 80 mg was 3410  1016 5115  808 and 7225  822 respectively which was significantly different p  001on the basis of the present findings it appears that the dosage of cucumin capable of producing a 50 contraction of the bladder was 40 mgthis study did not show any linear relationship between doubling curcumin dosage and the doubling of gall bladder contraction
