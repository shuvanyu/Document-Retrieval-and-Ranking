curcumin a polyphenolic compound derived from dietary spice turmeric possesses diverse pharmacologic effects including antiinflammatory antioxidant antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activitiesphase i clinical trials have shown that curcumin is safe even at high doses 12 gday in humans but exhibit poor bioavailabilitymajor reasons contributing to the low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin appear to be due to poor absorption rapid metabolism and rapid systemic eliminationto improve the bioavailability of curcumin numerous approaches have been undertakenthese approaches involve first the use of adjuvant like piperine that interferes with glucuronidation second the use of liposomal curcumin third curcumin nanoparticles fourth the use of curcumin phospholipid complex and fifth the use of structural analogues of curcumin eg ef24the latter has been reported to have a rapid absorption with a peak plasma halflifedespite the lower bioavailability therapeutic efficacy of curcumin against various human diseases including cancer cardiovascular diseases diabetes arthritis neurological diseases and crohns disease has been documentedenhanced bioavailability of curcumin in the near future is likely to bring this promising natural product to the forefront of therapeutic agents for treatment of human disease
