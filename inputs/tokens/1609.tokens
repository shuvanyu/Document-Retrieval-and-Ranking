objective to compare selected immunohistological features of inflammation in synovial tissue from patients with early and late osteoarthritis oamethods synovial tissue samples were obtained from 10 patients with knee pain normal radiographs and arthroscopic manifestations of oa early oa and from 15 patients with oa undergoing knee joint arthroplasty late oaconventional immunohistochemical techniques were used to measure microscopic manifestations of inflammationthe inflammatory cell infiltrate blood vessel formation and angiogenic factors nfκb activation expression of tumour necrosis factor α tnfα and interleukin 1ß il1ß and the presence of cyclooxygenase cox1 and cox2 were quantifiedfibroblastlike synoviocytes fls were isolated from early and late oa tissue samples to compare in vitro production of prostaglandin e2 pge2 results synovial tissue from patients with early oa demonstrated significantly greater cd4 p  0017 and cd68 p0001 cell infiltration blood vessel formation p  001 vascular endothelial growth factor p  0001 and intercellular adhesion molecule1 expression p0001numbers of cells producing tnfα and il1ß were also significantly greater in early oa p0001manifestations of inflammation in early oa were associated with increased expression of the nfκb1 p0001 and rela p  0015 subunits and with increased cox2 expression p  004cytokineinduced pge2 production by cultured fls was similar in both groupsconclusion increased mononuclear cell infiltration and overexpression of mediators of inflammation were seen in early oa compared with late oaisolated fls were functionally similar in both groups consistent with microenvironmental differences in the synovial tissue during different phases of oathese observations may have important therapeutic implications for some patients during the early evolution of oa
