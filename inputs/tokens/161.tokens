epidemiological studies indicate that diets rich in fruits and vegetables fv are protective against cvdpuréed fv products retain many beneficial components including flavonoids carotenoids vitamin c and dietary fibresthe present study aimed to establish the physiological effects of acute ingestion of a fv puréebased drink fvpd on vasodilation antioxidant status phytochemical bioavailability and other cvd risk factorsa total of twentyfour subjects aged 3070 years completed the randomised singleblind controlled crossover test meal studysubjects consumed 400 ml of the fvpd or a fruitflavoured sugarmatched control after following a lowflavonoid diet for 5 d blood and urine samples were collected throughout the study day and vascular reactivity was assessed at 90 min intervals using laser doppler iontophoresisthe fvpd significantly increased plasma vitamin c p 0002 and total nitratenitrite p 0001 concentrationsthere was a near significant time by treatment effect on ex vivo ldl oxidation p 0068 with a longer lag phase after consuming the fvpdduring the 6 h after juice consumption the antioxidant capacity of plasma increased significantly p 0003 and there was a simultaneous increase in plasma and urinary phenolic metabolites p 005there were significantly lower glucose and insulin peaks after ingestion of the fvpd compared with control p 0019 and 0003 and a trend towards increased endotheliumdependent vasodilation following fvpd consumption p 0061overall fvpd consumption significantly increased plasma vitamin c and total nitratenitrite concentrations with a trend towards increased endotheliumdependent vasodilationpuréed fv products are useful vehicles for increasing micronutrient status plasma antioxidant capacity and in vivo no generation which may contribute to cvd risk reduction
