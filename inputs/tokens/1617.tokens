chemotherapy remains the core of anticancer treatmenthowever despite the tremendous strides made in the development of targeted anticancer therapies emergence of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is still a major obstacle in the successful management of resistant tumourstherefore profound investigation into the indepth molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is essential and may hopefully translate into effective therapies that can flip the switch from drug resistance to susceptibilitymechanistically resistance phenomena may be explained by i overexpression of drug efflux pumps ii enhanced drug detoxification iii rapid dna repair efficiency iv defects in apoptosis regulation and v active cell survival signalsseveral adverse effects associated with multidrug resistance and the need for safe multitargeted anticancer drugs instigated the use of the phytochemical curcumin the yellow pigment of the spice turmeric which has pleotropic activitieswe performed a structured literature review using pubmed and medline searches with secondary review of cited publications identifying studies on the role of curcumin in conquering drug resistance in cancerthis review describes how curcumin sensitizes cancer cells through regulation of multiple multidrug resistance pathways thus employing one drug for multiple targetscurcumin helps the cancer cells to regain their forgotten apoptosis modulates drugtarget interaction at different levels restrains survival pathways when their proteins are overexpressed and finds an alternate way to carry forward the process of sensitization of different resistant tumoursadditionally the review dissects the role of curcumin if any in targeting the major culprit of drug resistance cancer stem cells csc thereby circumventing resistancetaken together this review strongly suggests that curcumin is a promising chemosensitizing agent and that the unique properties of curcumin may be exploited for successful management of resistant tumours
