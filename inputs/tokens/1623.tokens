curcumin diferuloylmethane an active constituent of turmeric is a welldescribed phytochemical which has been used since ancient times for the treatment of various diseasesthe dysregulation of cell signaling pathways by the gradual alteration of regulatory proteins is the root cause of cancerscurcumin modulates regulatory proteins through various molecular mechanismsseveral research studies have provided indepth analysis of multiple targets through which curcumin induces protective effects against cancers including gastrointestinal genitourinary gynecological hematological pulmonary thymic brain breast and bonethe molecular mechanisms of action of curcumin in treating different types of cancers remain under investigationthe multifaceted role of this dietary agent is mediated through its inhibition of several cell signaling pathways at multiple levelscurcumin has the ability to inhibit carcinogenicity through the modulation of the cell cycle by binding directly and indirectly to molecular targets including transcription factors nfkb stat3 Î²catenin and ap1 growth factors egf pdgf and vegf enzymes cox2 inos and mmps kinases cyclin d1 cdks akt pkc and ampk inflammatory cytokines tnf mcp il1 and il6 upregulation of proapoptotic bax bad and bak and downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins bcl2 and bclxla variety of animal models and human studies have proven that curcumin is safe and well tolerated even at very high dosesthis study elaborates the current understanding of the chemopreventive effects of curcumin through its multiple molecular pathways and highlights its therapeutic value in the treatment and prevention of a wide range of cancerscopyright  2013 international union of biochemistry and molecular biology inc
