objectives curcumin diferuloylmethane is the principal biochemical component of the spice turmeric and has been shown to possess potent anticatabolic antiinflammatory and antioxidant propertiesthis article aims to provide a summary of the actions of curcumin on articular chondrocytes from the available literature with the use of a textmining toolwe highlight both the potential benefits and drawbacks of using this chemopreventive agent for treating osteoarthritis oawe also explore the recent literature on the molecular mechanisms of curcumin mediated alterations in gene expression mediated via activator protein 1 ap1nuclear factorkappa b nfkappab signalling in chondrocytes osteoblasts and synovial fibroblastsmethods a computeraided search of the pubmedmedline database aided by a textmining tool to interrogate the resnet mammalian database 60results recent work has shown that curcumin protects human chondrocytes from the catabolic actions of interleukin1 beta il1beta including matrix metalloproteinase mmp3 upregulation inhibition of collagen type ii and downregulation of beta1integrin expressioncurcumin blocks il1betainduced proteoglycan degradation ap1nfkappab signalling chondrocyte apoptosis and activation of caspase3conclusions the available data from published in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that curcumin may be a beneficial complementary treatment for oa in humans and companion animalsnevertheless before initiating extensive clinical trials more basic research is required to improve its solubility absorption and bioavailability and gain additional information about its safety and efficacy in different speciesonce these obstacles have been overcome curcumin and structurally related biochemicals may become safer and more suitable nutraceutical alternatives to the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that are currently used for the treatment of oacopyright 2009 osteoarthritis research society internationalall rights reserved
