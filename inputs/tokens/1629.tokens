scope the incidence of cancer is significantly lower in regions where turmeric is heavily consumedwhether lower cancer incidence is due to turmeric was investigated by examining its effects on tumor cell proliferation on proinflammatory transcription factors nfκb and stat3 and on associated gene productsmethods and results cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity were measured by the mtt method nfκb activity by emsa protein expression by western blot analysis ros generation by facs analysis and osteoclastogenesis by trap assayturmeric inhibited nfκb activation and downregulated nfκbregulated gene products linked to survival bcl2 cflip xiap and ciap1 proliferation cyclin d1 and cmyc and metastasis cxcr4 of cancer cellsthe spice suppressed the activation of stat3 and induced the death receptors dr4 and dr5turmeric enhanced the production of ros and suppressed the growth of tumor cell linesfurthermore turmeric sensitized the tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents capecitabine and taxolturmeric was found to be more potent than pure curcumin for cell growth inhibitionturmeric also inhibited nfκb activation induced by rankl that correlated with the suppression of osteoclastogenesisconclusion our results indicate that turmeric can effectively block the proliferation of tumor cells through the suppression of nfκb and stat3 pathways
