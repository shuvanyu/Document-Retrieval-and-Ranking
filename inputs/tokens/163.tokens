because of volatilization and leaching from their application in consumer and personal care products phthalate esters are ubiquitous contaminants in the indoor environmentin this study we measured concentrations and profiles of 9 phthalate esters in indoor dust samples collected from six cities in china n  75for comparison we also analyzed samples collected from albany new york usa n  33the results indicated that concentrations except for dicyclohexyl phthalate dchp and bis2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and profiles of phthalate esters varied significantly between the two countriesconcentrations of diethyl phthalate dep dinhexyl phthalate dnhp and benzyl butyl phthalate bzbp were 5 to 10 times higher in dust samples collected from albany than those from the chinese citiesin contrast concentrations of diisobutyl phthalate dibp in dust samples from albany were 5 times lower than those from the chinese citieswe estimated the daily intake di of phthalate esters through the routes of dust ingestion and dermal dust absorptionthe extent of contribution of indoor dust to human exposures varied depending on the type of phthalate estersthe contribution of dust to dehp exposure was 25 and 1058 of the estimated total dis in china and the usa respectivelyon the basis of the estimates of total dis of phthalates extrapolated from urinary metabolite concentrations the contributions of inhalation dermal absorption and dietary intake to total dis were estimatedthe results indicated that dietary intake is the main source of exposure to dehp especially in china whereas dermal exposure was a major source for depthis is the first study to elucidate sources of human exposure to phthalates among the general population in china
