for 20 years many articles report the presence of new compounds called emerging compounds in wastewater and aquatic environmentsthe us epa united states  environmental protection agency defines emerging pollutants as new chemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and human health are poorly understoodthe objective of this work was to identify data on emerging pollutants concentrations in wastewater in influent and effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and to determine the performance of sewage disposalwe collected 44 publications in our databasewe sought especially for data on phthalates bisphenol a and pharmaceuticals including drugs for human health and disinfectantswe gathered concentration data and chose 50 pharmaceutical molecules six phthalates and bisphenol athe concentrations measured in the influent ranged from 0007 to 5663 μg per liter and the removal rates ranges from 0 contrast media to 97 psychostimulantcaffeine is the molecule whose concentration in influent was highest among the molecules investigated in means 5663 μg per liter with a removal rate around 97 leading to a concentration in the effluent that did not exceed 177 μg per literthe concentrations of ofloxacin were the lowest and varied between 0007 and 2275 μg per liter in the influent treatment plant and 0007 and 0816 μg per liter in the effluentamong phthalates dehp is the most widely used and quantified by the authors in wastewater and the rate of removal of phthalates is greater than 90 for most of the studied compoundsthe removal rate for antibiotics is about 50 and 71 for bisphenol a analgesics anti inflammatories and betablockers are the most resistant to treatment 3040 of removal ratesome pharmaceutical molecules for which we have not collected many data and which concentrations seem high as tetracycline codeine and contrast products deserve further researchcopyright  2011 elsevier gmbhall rights reserved
