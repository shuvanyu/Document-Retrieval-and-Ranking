background women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes but the risk and time of onset have not been fully quantifiedwe therefore did a comprehensive systematic review and metaanalysis to assess the strength of association between these conditions and the effect of factors that might modify the riskmethods we identified cohort studies in which women who had developed type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes were followed up between jan 1 1960 and jan 31 2009 from embase and medline205 relevant reports were hand searchedwe selected 20 studies that included 675 455 women and 10 859 type 2 diabetic eventswe calculated and pooled unadjusted relative risks rrs with 95 cis for each study using a randomeffects modelsubgroups analysed were the number of cases of type 2 diabetes ethnic origin duration of followup maternal age bodymass index and diagnostic criteriafindings women with gestational diabetes had an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy rr 743 95 ci 4791151although the largest study 659 164 women 9502 cases of type 2 diabetes had the largest rr 126 95 ci 12151319 rrs were generally consistent among the subgroups assessedinterpretation increased awareness of the magnitude and timing of the risk of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes among patients and clinicians could provide an opportunity to test and use dietary lifestyle and pharmacological interventions that might prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in affected womenfunding none
