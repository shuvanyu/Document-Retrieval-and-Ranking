type 1 diabetes is increasing rapidly in many parts of the western world most evidently in scandinaviaa low concordance rate of insulindependent diabetes mellitus among monozygotic twins clearly indicates that genetic risk factors may be necessary but are not sufficient for the disease to occurthe strongest genetic risk markers are located in the hla region of chromosome 6 but these dna specificities differ in different populationsrisk genes are indicated in other chromosomes of the human genome suggesting a complex interaction between genes and environment as the cause of the diseasethe pathogenesis of the disease is proposed to be autoimmune in nature and environmental risk factors may either initiate autoimmunity or accelerate an already ongoing betacell destructionrisk factors disclosed by epidemiological studies that may accelerate the pathogenetic process are a cold environment a high growth rate infections and stressful life eventsrisk factors that may initiate the autoimmune process include early exposure to cows milk proteins nitrosamines or early foetal events such as blood group incompatibility or foetal viral infectionsin conclusion populationbased epidemiological studies have helped to confirm proposed aetiological models that have arisen from experimental researchthese epidemiological studies have also introduced important new findings that may reveal the complex aetiology of the disease and advance understanding closer to the ultimate goal of primary prevention
