objective higher heme iron intake is associated with increased type 2 diabetes riskhowever no previous study has evaluated gestational diabetes mellitus gdm risk in relation to heme iron intake during pregnancywe investigated associations of maternal preconceptional and early pregnancy heme and nonheme iron intake with subsequent gdm riskresearch design and methods we conducted a prospective cohort study of 3158 pregnant womena food frequency questionnaire was used to assess maternal dietmultivariable generalized linear regression models were used to derive estimates of relative risks rrs and 95 cisresults approximately 50 of the cohort developed gdm n  158heme iron intake was positively and significantly associated with gdm risk ptrend  004after adjusting for confounders women reporting the highest heme iron intake levels 152 vs 048 mg per day experienced a 331foldincreased gdm risk 95 ci 1021072in fully adjusted models we noted that a 1mg per day increase in heme iron was associated with a 51 increased gdm risk rr 151 95 ci 099236nonheme iron was inversely though not statistically significantly associated with gdm risk and the corresponding rrs were 100 083 062 and 061 across quartiles of nonheme iron intake ptrend  008conclusions high levels of dietary heme iron intake during the preconceptional and early pregnancy period may be associated with increased gdm riskassociations of gdm risk with dietary nonheme iron intake are less clearconfirmation of these findings by future studies is warranted
