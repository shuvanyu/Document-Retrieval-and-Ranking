background two criteria based on a 2 h 75 g ogtt are being used for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes gdm those recommended over the years by the world health organization who and those recently recommended by the international association for diabetes in pregnancy study group iadpsg the latter generated in the hapo study and based on pregnancy outcomesour aim is to systematically review the evidence for the associations between gdm according to these criteria and adverse outcomesmethods we searched relevant studies in medline embase lilacs the cochrane library cinhal whoafro library imsear emcat imemr and wprimwe included cohort studies permitting the evaluation of gdm diagnosed by who and or iadpsg criteria against adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in untreated womenonly studies with universal application of a 75 g ogtt were includedrelative risks rrs and their 95 confidence intervals ci were obtained for each studywe combined study results using a randomeffects modelinconsistency across studies was defined by an inconsistency index i2  50results data were extracted from eight studies totaling 44829 womengreater risk of adverse outcomes was observed for both diagnostic criteriawhen using the who criteria consistent associations were seen for macrosomia rr  181 95ci 147222 p  0001 large for gestational age rr  153 95ci 139169 p  0001 perinatal mortality rr  155 95 ci 088273 p  013 preeclampsia rr  169 95ci 131218 p  0001 and cesarean delivery rr  13795ci 124151 p  0001less data were available for the iadpsg criteria and associations were inconsistent across studies i2  73magnitudes of rrs and their 95cis were 173 128235 p  0001 for large for gestational age 171 138213 p  0001 for preeclampsia and 123 101151 p  004 for cesarean deliveryexcluding either the hapo or the ebdg studies minimally altered these associations but the rrs seen for the iadpsg criteria were reduced after excluding hapoconclusions the who and the iadpsg criteria for gdm identified women at a small increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomesassociations were of similar magnitude for both criteriahowever high inconsistency was seen for those with the iadpsg criteriafull evaluation of the latter in settings other than hapo requires additional studies
