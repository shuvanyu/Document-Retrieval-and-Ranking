two carotenoids found in egg yolk lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the macular retina where they may reduce photostressincreases in serum lutein and zeaxanthin were observed in previous egg interventions but no study measured macular carotenoidsthe objective of this project was to determine whether increased consumption of eggs would increase retinal lutein and zeaxanthin or macular pigmenttwentyfour females between 24 and 59 y were assigned to a pill treatment pill or 1 of 2 egg treatments for 12 wkindividuals in the pill treatment consumed 1 sugarfilled capsuledindividuals in the egg treatments consumed 6 eggswk containing either 331 microg egg 1 or 964 microg egg 2 of lutein and zeaxanthinyolkserum cholesterol serum carotenoids and macular pigment od mpod were measured at baseline and after 4 8 and 12 wk of interventionserum cholesterol concentrations did not change in either egg treatment group but total cholesterol p  004 and triglycerides p  002 increased in the pill groupserum zeaxanthin but not serum lutein increased in both the egg 1 p  004 and egg 2 p  001 groupslikewise mpod increased in both the egg 1 p  0001 and egg 2 p  0049 groupsalthough the aggregate concentration of carotenoid in 1 egg yolk may be modest relative to other sources such as spinach their bioavailability to the retina appears to be highincreasing egg consumption to 6 eggswk may be an effective method to increase mpod
