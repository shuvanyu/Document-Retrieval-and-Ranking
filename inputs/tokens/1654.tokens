agerelated macular degeneration amd is a common disorder that causes irreversible loss of central visionincreased intake of foods containing zeaxanthin may be effective in preventing amd because the macula accumulates zeaxanthin and lutein oxygenated carotenoids with antioxidant and blue lightabsorbing propertieslycium barbarum l is a small red berry known as fructus lycii and wolfberry in the west and kei tze and gou qi zi in asiawolfberry is rich in zeaxanthin dipalmitate and is valued in chinese culture for being good for visionthe aim of this study which was a singleblinded placebocontrolled human intervention trial of parallel design was to provide data on how fasting plasma zeaxanthin concentration changes as a result of dietary supplementation with whole wolfberriesfasting blood was collected from healthy consenting subjects fourteen subjects took 15 gd wolfberry estimated to contain almost 3 mg zeaxanthin for 28 d repeat fasting blood was collected on day 29age and sexmatched controls n 13 took no wolfberryresponses in the two groups were compared using the mannwhitney testafter supplementation plasma zeaxanthin increased 25fold mean values on day 1 and 29 were 0038 sem 0003 and 0096 sem 0009 micromoll p001 respectively for the supplementation group and 0038 sem 0003 and 0043 sem 0003 micromoll p005 respectively for the control groupthis human supplementation trial shows that zeaxanthin in whole wolfberries is bioavailable and that intake of a modest daily amount markedly increases fasting plasma zeaxanthin levelsthese new data will support further study of dietary strategies to maintain macular pigment density
