purpose the retinal carotenoids lutein l and zeaxanthin z that form the macular pigment mp may help to prevent neovascular agerelated macular degenerationthe purpose of this study was to determine whether mp density in the retina could be raised by increasing dietary intake of l and z from foodsmethods macular pigment was measured psychophysically for 13 subjectsserum concentrations of l z and betacarotene were measured by highperformance liquid chromatographyeleven subjects modified their usual daily diets by adding 60 g of spinach 108 mg l 03 mg z 5 mg betacarotene and ten also added 150 g of corn 03 mg z 04 mg l two other subjects were given only corndietary modification lasted up to 15 weeksresults for the subjects fed spinach or spinach and corn three types of responses to dietary modification were identified eight retinal responders had increases in serum l mean 33 sd 22 and in mp density mean 19 sd 11 two retinal nonresponders showed substantial increases in serum l mean 31 but not in mp density mean 11 one serum and retinal nonresponder showed no changes in serum l z or betacarotene and no change in mp densityfor the two subjects given only corn serum l changed little 11 6 but in one subject serum z increased 70 and mp density increased 25conclusions increases in mp density were obtained within 4 weeks of dietary modification for most but not all subjectswhen mp density increased with dietary modification it remained elevated for at least several months after resuming an unmodified dietaugmentation of mp for both experimental and clinical investigation appears to be feasible for many persons
