the present study was designed to assess the relationship between iris color and macular pigment optical densityboth melanin and carotenoids responsible for iris color and macular pigment composition respectively appear to protect the retina through similar mechanisms and higher concentrations may reduce the incidence of retinal degenerationsto evaluate this relationship 95 subjects were examined and the following variables were measured iris color macular pigment optical density mp plasma concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and betacarotene dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin and betacarotene and total fat intakeiris color was determined by self assessment and classified as blue or gray group i green or hazel group ii or brown or black group iiimp density was measured psychophysically by measuring foveal and parafoveal sensitivities to lights of 460 and 550 nm using the method of heterochromatic flicker photometryplasma carotenoid concentrations were measured using reversephase highperformance liquid chromatographydietary intake was determined by a detailed foodfrequency questionnairedespite similarities in diet and in blood concentrations of carotenoids significant differences in macular pigment density p  002 were found for different colored irises group i n  38 mp  025 group ii n  26 mp  032 group iii n  31 mp  038the covariation of iris color and mp indicates that past epidemiologic studies have not adequately determined the independent effects of either factorthe relationship of mp and iris color may be the result of one or two factors the evolution of a shared tendency to accumulate melanin and carotenoids due to similar environmental pressures eglight and oxygen andor mp might be depleted due to the tendency for eyes with light irises to transmit more light than eyes with dark irises thus causing increased oxidative stress
