purpose to explore the association between consumption of fruits and vegetables and the presence of glaucoma in older african american womendesign crosssectional studymethods disc photographs and suprathreshold visual fields were obtained from the 662 african american participants in the study of osteoporotic fracturesmasked trained readers graded all discs and two glaucoma specialists reviewed photos and visual fieldsthe block food frequency questionnaire assessed food consumptionrelationships between selected fruitvegetablenutrient consumption and glaucoma were evaluated using logistic regression models after adjusting for potential confoundersresults after excluding women missing food frequency questionnaire and disc data 584 african american women 882 of total african american cohort were includedglaucoma was diagnosed in at least one eye in 77 subjects 13women who ate 3 or more servingsday of fruitsfruit juices were 79 odds ratio or021 95 confidence interval ci 008060 less likely to have glaucoma than women who ate less than one servingdaywomen who consumed more than 2 servingsweek of fresh oranges or018 95ci 006051 and peaches or030 95ci 013067 had a decreased odds of glaucoma compared to those consuming less than one servingweekfor vegetables 1 servingweek compared to 1 servingmonth of collardgreenskale decreased the odds of glaucoma by 57 or043 95ci 021085there was a protective trend against glaucoma in those consuming more fruitfruit juices p0023 fresh oranges p0002 fresh peaches p0002 and collard greenskale p0014higher consumption of carrots p0061 and spinach p0094 also showed some associationsindividual nutrient intake from food sources found protective trends with higher intakes of vitamin a p0011 vitamin c p0018 and αcarotene p0021 and close to statistically significant trends with βcarotene p0052 folate p0056 and luteinzeaxanthin p0077conclusion higher intake of certain fruits and vegetables high in vitamins a and c and carotenoids may be associated with a decreased likelihood of glaucoma in older african american womenrandomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether the intake of specific nutrients changes the risk of glaucoma
