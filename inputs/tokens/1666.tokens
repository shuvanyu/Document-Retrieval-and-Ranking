purposeto investigate the relationship between supplementary consumption of the oxidants calcium and iron and the prevalence of glaucomamethodsthis crosssectional study included 3833 participants in the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes for 2007 and 2008 40 years of age who reported a presence or absence of glaucomaparticipants were interviewed regarding the use of dietary supplements and antacids during the preceding 30day perioddata pertaining to the supplementary intake of calcium and iron was aggregated and divided into quintilesinformation regarding the presence or absence of glaucoma and demographics comorbidities and healthrelated behavior was obtained via interviewresultsparticipants who consumed 800 mgd of supplementary calcium or 18 mgd of supplementary iron had significantly higher odds of having been diagnosed with glaucoma than did those who had not consumed supplementary calcium or iron after adjustment for potential confounders odds ratio or 244 95 confidence interval ci 125476 for calcium or 380 95 ci 179806 for ironconcurrent consumption of both calcium and iron above these levels was associated with still greater odds of having been diagnosed with glaucoma or 724 95 ci 2422162a clear doseresponse relationship between quintiles of supplementary calcium or iron intake and glaucoma prevalence was not foundconclusionsthese results suggest that there may be a threshold intake of iron and calcium above which there is an increased risk of development of glaucomaprospective longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether oxidant intake is a risk factor for development and progression of glaucoma
