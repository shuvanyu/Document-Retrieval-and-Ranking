background different chemical forms of mercury occur naturally in human milkthe most controversial aspect of early postnatal exposure to organic mercury is ethylmercury ethg in thimerosalcontaining vaccines tcv still being used in many countriesthus exclusively breastfed infants can be exposed to both fish derived methylmercury mehg in maternal diets and to ethg from tcvthe aim of the study is to evaluate a new analytical method for ethyl and methyl mercury in hair samples of breastfed infants who had received the recommended schedule of tcvmethods the hair of infants 12 months that had been exposed to tcv hepatitis b and dtap was analyseda method coupling isothermal gas chromatography with coldvapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry was used for mehg which can also speciate ethg in biological matricesresults in 20 samples of infants hair all but two samples showed variable amounts of mehg 103 to 668 ngg while precise and reliable concentrations of ethg 37 to 650 ngg were found in 15 of the 20 samplesa statistically significant inverse association r05572 p00384 was found between hairethg concentrations and the time elapsed after the last tcv shotconclusions the analytical method proved sensitive enough to quantify ethg in babies hair after acute exposure to thimerosal in vaccine shotsprovided that the mass of hair was above 10mg organicmercury exposure during early life can be speciated and quantified in babies first hair thus opening opportunities for clinical and forensic studiescopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
