serum cobalamin analogue levels were estimated by the discrepancy in cobalamin results with radioassays done with pure intrinsic factor and r binder in 364 patients with low cobalamin levelsno differences were found among the various causes of low cobalamin levels except for the lower analogue levels among pregnant womenhowever 76 patients with low cobalamin levels and primarily neurologic spinal cord neuropathic cerebral or a combination of these symptoms had significantly higher analogue levels than 19 patients with primarily hematologic abnormalitiesmoreover the analogue levels correlated with hemoglobin values and were significantly higher in patients without megaloblastic changes in their bone marrow than in patients with megaloblastosisan analysis limited to 47 patients with pernicious anemia yielded similar findingsthe seven patients with only neurologic abnormalities had higher analogue levels than did the nine patients with only hematologic abnormalitiesbecause of the higher analogue levels the assay done with r binder failed to register low cobalamin levels in 33 of 76 patients with low cobalamin levels and primarily neurologic abnormality compared with only two of 19 with hematologic abnormality and in 10 of 20 patients with pernicious anemia who had neurologic abnormalities compared with only two of 12 without such abnormalitiesthese differences between patients with hematologic disturbances and patients with neurologic disturbances and the inverse relationship of analogue level with severity of anemia suggest that the disproportionate accumulation of analogues may explain why some patients with cobalamin deficiency display neurologic abnormalities while others do not
