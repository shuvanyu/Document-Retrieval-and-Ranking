the effect of alternative dietary habits and prolonged lactation on the nutrient and contaminant concentrations in human milk was studiedthe study sample consisted of mothers on macrobiotic diets containing little or no diary products and meat at 23 months postpartum n  9 and 913 months postpartum n  12 and mothers on omnivorous diets at 23 months postpartum n  10protein and zinc concentrations in breastmilk from macrobiotic mothers decreased with stage of lactationafter adjustment for stage of lactation milk from macrobiotic mothers contained less calcium magnesium and saturated fatty acids c150c200 and more polyunsaturated fatty acidsobserved tendencies for lower protein and fat and higher lactose concentrations in the macrobiotic group were not statistically significantconcentrations of vitamin b12 hcb and polychlorinated biphenyls pcb 118 pcb 138 pcb 153 and pcb 180 were lower in the macrobiotic groupafter adjustment for confounding variables meat and fish consumption but not dairy products contributed to vitamin b12 concentrationsmeat and diary products strongly contributed to breastmilk concentrations of dieldrin and pcbs fish to pcb 118 and smoking to ddt and dieldrinour findings suggest that breastmilk contamination could be reduced by abstinence from smoking and a moderate intake of animal productshowever risk of nutritional deficiencies rules out complete avoidance of meat fish or diary productsquantitative research on the effects of a reduced consumption of animal products as well as smoking on breastmilk contamination is warranted
