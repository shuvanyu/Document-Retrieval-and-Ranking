overwhelming evidence suggests that edible small and softfleshed berry fruits may have beneficial effects against several types of human cancersthe anticancer potential of berries has been related at least in part to a multitude of bioactive phytochemicals that these colorful fruits contain including polyphenols flavonoids proanthocyanidins ellagitannins gallotannins phenolic acids stilbenoids lignans and triterpenoidsstudies show that the anticancer effects of berry bioactives are partially mediated through their abilities to counteract reduce and also repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammationin addition berry bioactives also regulate carcinogen and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes various transcription and growth factors inflammatory cytokines and subcellular signaling pathways of cancer cell proliferation apoptosis and tumor angiogenesisberry phytochemicals may also potentially sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents by inhibiting pathways that lead to treatment resistance and berry fruit consumption may provide protection from therapyassociated toxicitiesalthough a wide variety of berry fruits are consumed worldwide this paper focuses on those commonly consumed in north america namely blackberries black raspberries blueberries cranberries red raspberries and strawberriesin addition a large body of studies on singly purified berry bioactives is available but this paper focuses on studies of whole berries per se that is as berry extracts and purified fractions juices and freezedried powderspotential mechanisms of anticancer action and bioavailability of berry phenolics as well as gaps in knowledge and recommendations for future berry research are also briefly discussed
