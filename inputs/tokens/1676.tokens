activation of apoptosis via death receptors is a tightly regulated event and the death pathway itself is open to interference on the part of soluble or membranebound decoy receptorsthe aggregation state of the deathinducing ligand is a crucial factor particularly when these molecules are used as recombinant drugs against tumorswhether tumors are sensitive to such ligands is determined by both the net abundance of death receptors versus decoy receptors and the balance between intracellular apoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanismsthis means that in vivo elimination of tumor cells by effector arms such as t lymphocytes natural killer cells macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on both the function of activated lymphoid cells and the genetic properties of tumor cellsdeath receptor ligands however may be a doubleedged swordwhen expressed on cytotoxic t lymphocytes natural killer cells monocytes and dendritic cells they induce the apoptosis of many tumor cells whereas their expression on tumor cells induces the apoptosis of killer cellsthe in vivo result is influenced by the number of infiltrating cells their state of activation the cytokine repertoire in the tumor microenvironment and the ability of the tumor to produce soluble factors inhibiting their cytolytic functions
