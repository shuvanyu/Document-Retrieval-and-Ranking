since the adoption of vegetarian diets as a healthy lifestyle has become popular the cardiovascular effects of longterm vegetarianism need to be exploredthe present study aimed to compare the presence and severity of carotid atherosclerosis ca and the blood levels of vitamin b12 homocysteine hcy and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule1 svcam1 between 57 healthy postmenopausal vegetarians and 61 agematched omnivorescarotid atherosclerosis as measured by ultrasound was found to be of no significant difference between the two groupsyet fasting blood glucose lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and vitamin b12 were significantly lower while hcy and svcam1 were higher in the vegetarians as comparing with the omnivoresmultivariate regression analysis showed that the level of vitamin b12 was negatively associated with the level of hcyvegetarianism itself and hcy level were significantly associated with svcam1 level in univariate analysis however after adjustment for covariates we identified age but not vegetarianism as the determinant of svcam1 levelmultiple linear regression analysis identified age and systolic blood pressure but not vegetarianism as determinants of common carotid artery imtin conclusion there was no significant difference in ca between apparently healthy postmenopausal vegetarians and omnivoresthe findings of elevated hcy in vegetarians indicate the importance of prevention of vitamin b12 deficiency
