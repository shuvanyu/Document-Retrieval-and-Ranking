background vegetarianism is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseasehowever studies of arterial function in vegetarians are limitedmethods this study investigated arterial function in vegetarianism by comparing 49 healthy postmenopausal vegetarians with 41 agematched omnivoresthe arterial function of the common carotid artery was assessed by carotid duplex while the pulse dynamics method was used to measure brachial artery distensibility bad compliance bac and resistance barfasting blood levels of glucose lipids lipoprotein a highsensitivity creactive protein homocysteine and vitamin b12 were also measuredresults vegetarians had significantly lower serum cholesterol highdensity and lowdensity lipoprotein and glucose compared with omnivoresthey also had lower vitamin b12 but higher homocysteine levelsserum levels of lipoprotein a and highsensitivity creactive protein were no different between the two groupsthere were no significant differences in carotid beta stiffness index bac and bad between the two groups even after adjustment for associated covariateshowever bar was significantly lower in vegetarians than in omnivoresmultiple linear regression analysis revealed that age and pulse pressure were two important determinants of carotid beta stiffness index and badvegetarianism is not associated with better arterial elasticityconclusion apparently healthy postmenopausal vegetarians are not significantly better in terms of carotid beta stiffness index bac and bad but have significantly decreased bar than omnivoresprevention of vitamin b12 deficiency might be beneficial for cardiovascular health in vegetarians
