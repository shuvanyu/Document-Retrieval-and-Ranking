objective vegetarians are more vascularhealthy but those with subnormal vitamin b12 status have impaired arterial endothelial function and increased intimamedia thicknesswe aimed to study the impact of vitamin b12 supplementation on these markers in the vegetariansdesign doubleblind placebo controlled randomised crossover studysetting community dwelling vegetariansparticipants fifty healthy vegetarians vegetarian diet for at least 6 years were recruitedintervention vitamin b12 500 µgday or identical placebo were given for 12 weeks with 10 weeks of placebowashout before crossover n43 and then open label vitamin b12 for additional 24 weeks n41measurement flowmediated dilation of brachial artery fmd and intimamedia thickness imt of carotid artery were measured by ultrasoundresults the mean age of the subjects was 459 years and 22 44 were malethirtyfive subjects 70 had serum b12 levels 150 pmollvitamin b12 supplementation significantly increased serum vitamin b12 levels p00001 and lowered plasma homocysteine p005after vitamin b12 supplementation but not placebo significant improvement of brachial fmd 6318 to 6919 p00001 and in carotid imt 069009 mm to 067009 mm p005 were found with further improvement in fmd to 7417 p00001 and imt to 065009 mm p0001 after 24 weeks open label vitamin b12there were no significant changes in blood pressures or lipid profileson multivariate analysis changes in b12 β025 p002 but not homocysteine were related to changes in fmd r032 f value319 p0028conclusions vitamin b12 supplementation improved arterial function in vegetarians with subnormal vitamin b12 levels proposing a novel strategy for atherosclerosis prevention
