context hypovitaminosis d appears to be on the rise in young children with implications for skeletal and overall healthobjective the objective of the study was to compare the safety and efficacy of vitamin d2 daily vitamin d2 weekly and vitamin d3 daily combined with supplemental calcium in raising serum 25hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd and lowering pth concentrationsdesign this was a 6wk randomized controlled trialsetting the study was conducted at an urban pediatric clinic in bostonsubjects forty otherwise healthy infants and toddlers with hypovitaminosis d 25ohd  20 ngml participated in the studyinterventions participants were assigned to one of three regimens 2000 iu oral vitamin d2 daily 50000 iu vitamin d2 weekly or 2000 iu vitamin d3 dailyeach was also prescribed elemental calcium 50 mgkgdinfants received treatment for 6 wkmain outcome measures before and after treatment serum measurements of 25ohd pth calcium and alkaline phosphatase were takenresults all treatments approximately tripled the 25ohd concentrationpreplanned comparisons were nonsignificant daily vitamin d2 vs weekly vitamin d2 12 difference in effect p  066 and daily d2 vs daily d3 7 p  082the mean serum calcium change was small and similar in the three groupsthere was no significant difference in pth suppressionconclusions shortterm vitamin d2 2000 iu daily vitamin d2 50000 iu weekly or vitamin d3 2000 iu daily yield equivalent outcomes in the treatment of hypovitaminosis d among young childrentherefore pediatric providers can individualize the treatment regimen for a given patient to ensure compliance given that no difference in efficacy or safety was noted among these three common treatment regimens
