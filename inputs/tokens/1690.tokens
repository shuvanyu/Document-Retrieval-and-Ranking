purpose to measure prospectively and directly both organ dose and effective dose ed for adult cardiac and pulmonary computed tomographic ct angiography by using current clinical protocols for 64detector ct in an anthropomorphic female phantom and to estimate lifetime attributable risk of breast and lung cancer incidence on the basis of measured ed and organ dosematerials and methods cardiac and pulmonary 64detector ct angiography was performed by using current clinical protocols to evaluate the pulmonary veins electrocardiographically ecg gated 64 sections at 0625mm collimation 120 kvp 300 ma 035second tube rotation native coronary arteries ecg gated 64 sections at 0625 mm 120 kvp maximum current 500750 ma minimum 100350 ma 035second tube rotation and pulmonary embolus 64 sections at 125 mm 140 kvp 645 ma 05second tube rotationabsorbed organ doses were measured by using an anthropomorphic female phantom and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor detectorsed was calculated from measured organ doses and the doselength productresults ed for current adult cardiac and pulmonary 64detector ct angiography protocols were 124318 msvoverall skin breast and esophagus and heart had the highest recorded absorbed organ dosesrelative risk for breast cancer incidence for girls and women was 10041042 for a single examinationrelative risk for lung cancer incidence for men and women was 10051076 from a single examinationconclusion eds and organ doses from 64detector ct are higher than those previously reported for adult cardiac and pulmonary ct angiography protocolsrisk for breast and lung cancer induction from these studies is greatest for the younger patient populationc rsna 2007
