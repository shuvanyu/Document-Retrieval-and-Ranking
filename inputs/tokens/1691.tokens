background a plantbased diet protects against chronic oxidative stressrelated diseasesdietary plants contain variable chemical families and amounts of antioxidantsit has been hypothesized that plant antioxidants may contribute to the beneficial health effects of dietary plantsour objective was to develop a comprehensive food database consisting of the total antioxidant content of typical foods as well as other dietary items such as traditional medicine plants herbs and spices and dietary supplementsthis database is intended for use in a wide range of nutritional research from in vitro and cell and animal studies to clinical trials and nutritional epidemiological studiesmethods we procured samples from countries worldwide and assayed the samples for their total antioxidant content using a modified version of the frap assayresults and sample information such as country of origin product andor brand name were registered for each individual food sample and constitute the antioxidant food tableresults the results demonstrate that there are several thousandfold differences in antioxidant content of foodsspices herbs and supplements include the most antioxidant rich products in our study some exceptionally highberries fruits nuts chocolate vegetables and products thereof constitute common foods and beverages with high antioxidant valuesconclusions this database is to our best knowledge the most comprehensive antioxidant food database published and it shows that plantbased foods introduce significantly more antioxidants into human diet than nonplant foodsbecause of the large variations observed between otherwise comparable food samples the study emphasizes the importance of using a comprehensive database combined with a detailed system for food registration in clinical and epidemiological studiesthe present antioxidant database is therefore an essential research tool to further elucidate the potential health effects of phytochemical antioxidants in diet
