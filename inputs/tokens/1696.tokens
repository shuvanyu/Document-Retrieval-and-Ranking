there is increasing evidence that the postprandial state is an important contributing factor to chronic diseasethe role of fruit phenolic compounds to protect health and lower disease risk through their actions in mitigating fedstate metabolic and oxidative stressors is of interest and the topic of the present papertwo main questions are posed first what is the role of plant foods specifically fruits rich in complex and simple phenolic compounds in postprandial metabolic management and second does the evidence support consuming these fruits with meals as a practical strategy to preserve health and lower risk for diseasethis review provides an overview of the postprandial literature specifically on the effect of fruits and their inherent phenolic compounds in human subjects on postprandial lipaemia glycaemiainsulinaemia and associated events such as oxidative stress and inflammationamong the identified wellcontrolled human trials using a postprandial paradigm 50Â  of the trials used wine or wine components and the remaining used various berriesnotwithstanding the need for more research the collected data suggest that consuming phenolicrich fruits increases the antioxidant capacity of the blood and when they are consumed with high fat and carbohydrate prooxidant and proinflammatory meals they may counterbalance their negative effectsgiven the content and availability of fat and carbohydrate in the western diet regular consumption of phenolicrich foods particularly in conjunction with meals appears to be a prudent strategy to maintain oxidative balance and health
