diabetes mellitus is associated with increased ros generation oxidative injury and obesityto elucidate the relationship between nutrition and ros generation we have investigated the effect of glucose challenge on ros generation by leucocytes p47phox protein a key protein in the enzyme nadph oxidase and alphatocopherol levelsblood samples were drawn from 14 normal subjects prior to at 1 2 and 3 h following ingestion of 75 g glucoseros generation by polymorphonuclear leucocytes pmnl and mononuclear cells mnc increased to a peak of 244  42 and 233  34 of the basal respectively at 2hthe levels of p47phox in mnc homogenates increased significantly at 2 h and 3 h after glucose intakealphatocopherol levels decreased significantly at 1 h 2 h and 3 h we conclude that glucose intake stimulates ros generation and p417phox of nadph oxidase increases oxidative load and causes a fall in alphatocopherol concentration
