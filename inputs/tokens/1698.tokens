background elevated levels of lipids such as total cholesterol tc lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldl and triglycerides tg are widely recognized as risk factors for cardiovascular disease cvdoxidized ldl oxldl is an emerging risk factor considered relevant in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction which is implicated in the progression of cvdconsumption of a diet rich in polyphenols may be cardioprotective through its impact on oxidative stress and protecting ldl from oxidationobjectives this study was designed to test the ability of strawberry phenolic compounds to mitigate the postprandial effects of a highfat meal on oxldl as well as investigate the effects of phenolic compounds on lipid metabolismmethods twentyfour hyperlipidemic men and women 14 women 10 men mean age 509  sd 15 years were recruited to participate in this randomized singleblind placebocontrolled 12wk crossover trialafter a 10day runin period subjects consumed either an active strawberry beverage str containing 10 g freezedried fruit or a placebo pbo beverage matched in energy and macronutrient composition for 6 weekstwice before randomization and once at the 6week crossover point subjects received either str or pbo with a highfat challenge meal hfmtc ldl highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol tg and oxldl were measured at defined intervals for 6 h before and after hfm challengefasting concentrations of blood variables at 0 6 and 12 weeks were compared to assess chronic intake of str or pboresults after the hfm during the runin period tg and oxldl were lower after str than pbo p  0005 p  001 and p  00008 respectivelyhfm responses after 6 weeks of str versus pbo resulted in decreased lipid levels and a sex by treatment interaction for oxldl p   00001 and p  00002conclusion the present results support a role for strawberry in mitigating fedstate oxidative stressors that may contribute to atherogenesis
