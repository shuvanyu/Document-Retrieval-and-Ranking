diets high in protein have shown positive effects on shortterm weight reduction and glycaemic controlhowever the understanding of how dietary macronutrient composition relates to longterm risk of type 2 diabetes is limitedthe aim of the present study was to examine intakes of macronutrients fibre and protein sources in relation to incident type 2 diabetesin total 27 140 individuals aged 4574 years from the populationbased malm√∂ diet and cancer cohort were includeddietary data were collected with a modified diet history method including registration of cooked mealsduring 12 years of followup 1709 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identifiedhigh protein intake was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes hazard ratio hr 127 for highest compared with lowest quintile 95  ci 108 149 p for trend  001when protein consumption increased by 5  of energy at the expense of carbohydrates hr 120 95  ci 109 133 or fat hr 121 95  ci 109 133 increased diabetes risk was observedintakes in the highest quintiles of processed meat hr 116 95  ci 100 136 p for trend  001 and eggs hr 121 95  ci 104 141 p for trend  002 were associated with increased riskintake of fibrerich bread and cereals was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes hr 084 95  ci 073 098 p for trend  0004in conclusion results from the present large populationbased prospective study indicate that high protein intake is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetesreplacing protein with carbohydrates may be favourable especially if fibrerich breads and cereals are chosen as carbohydrate sources
