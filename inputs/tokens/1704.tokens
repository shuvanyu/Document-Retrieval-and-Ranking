disrupted iron metabolism and excess iron accumulation has been reported in the brains of parkinsons disease pd patientsbecause excessive iron can induce oxidative stress subsequently causing degradation of nigral dopaminergic neurons in pd we determined the protective effect of a naturally occurring iron chelator phytic acid ip6 on 1methyl4phenylpyridinium mppinduced cell death in immortalized rat mesencephalicdopaminergic cellscell death was induced with mpp in normal and ironexcess conditions and cytotoxicity was measured by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide mtt assay and trypan blue stainingapoptotic cell death was also measured with caspase3 activity dna fragmentation and hoechst nuclear stainingcompared to mpp treatment ip6 30 micromoll increased cell viability by 19 p005 and decreased cell death by 22 p005a threefold increase in caspase3 activity p0001 and a twofold increase in dna fragmentation p005 with mpp treatment was decreased by 55 p001 and 52 p005 respectively with ip6cell survival was increased by 18 p005 and 42 p0001 with 30 and 100 micromoll of ip6 respectively in ironexcess conditionsa 40 and 52 p0001 protection was observed in caspase3 activity with 30 and 100 micromoll ip6 respectively in ironexcess conditionsimilarly a 45 reduction p0001 in dna fragmentation was found with 100 micromoll ip6in addition hoechst nuclear staining results confirmed the protective effect of ip6 against apoptosissimilar protection was also observed with the differentiated cellscollectively our results demonstrate a significant neuroprotective effect of phytate in a cell culture model of pd
