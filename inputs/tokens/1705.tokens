background inoxitol hexakisphosphate ip6 has been found to have an important role in biomineralization and a direct effect inhibiting mineralization of osteoblasts in vitro without impairing extracellular matrix production and expression of alkaline phosphataseip6 has been proposed to exhibit similar effects to those of bisphosphonates on bone resorption however its direct effect on osteoclasts ocl is presently unknownmethodologyprincipal findings the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ip6 on the raw 2647 monocytemacrophage mouse cell line and on human primary osteoclastson one hand we show that ip6 decreases the osteoclastogenesis in raw 2647 cells induced by rankl without affecting cell proliferation or cell viabilitythe number of trap positive cells and mrna levels of osteoclast markers such as trap calcitonin receptor cathepsin k and mmp9 was decreased by ip6 on rankltreated cellson the contrary when giving ip6 to mature osteoclasts after rankl treatment a significant increase of bone resorption activity and trap mrna levels was foundon the other hand we show that 1 Âµm of ip6 inhibits osteoclastogenesis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmnc and their resorption activity both when given to undifferentiated and to mature osteoclastsconclusionssignificance our results demonstrate that ip6 inhibits osteoclastogenesis on human pbmnc and on the raw2647 cell linethus ip6 may represent a novel type of selective inhibitor of osteoclasts and prove useful for the treatment of osteoporosis
