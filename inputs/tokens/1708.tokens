in nutritional epidemiology it is often assumed that nutrient absorption is proportional to nutrient intakefor several nutrients including nonhaem fe this assumption may not holddepending on the nutrients ingested with nonhaem fe its availability for absorption varies greatlytherefore using fe intake to examine associations between fe and health can impact upon the validity of findingsprevious algorithms that adjust fe intakes for dietary factors known to affect absorption have been found to underestimate fe absorption and in the present study perform poorly on independent dietary datawe have designed a new algorithm to adjust fe intakes for the effects of ascorbic acid meat fish and poultry phytate polyphenols and ca incorporating not only absorption data from test meals but also current understanding of fe absorptionin so doing we have created a robust and universal fe algorithm with potential for use in large cohortsthe algorithm described aims not to predict fe absorption but available fe in the gut a measure we believe to be of greater use in epidemiological researchavailable fe is fe available for absorption from the gastrointestinal tract taking into account enhancing or inhibiting effects of dietary modifiersour algorithm successfully estimated average fe availability in test meal data used to construct the algorithm and unlike other algorithms tested also provided plausible predictions when applied to independent dietary datafuture research is needed to evaluate the extent to which this algorithm is useful in epidemiological research to relate fe to health outcomes
