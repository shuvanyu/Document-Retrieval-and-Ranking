since the discovery in the 1980s that nitric oxide no is in fact the elusive endotheliumderived relaxing factor it has become evident that no is not only a major cardiovascular signalling molecule but that changes in its bioavailability are crucial in determining whether atherosclerosis will develop or notsustained high levels of harmful circulating stimuli associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus elicit responses in endothelial cells that appear sequentially namely endothelial cell activation and endothelial dysfunction eded characterised by reduced no bioavailability is now recognised by many as an early reversible precursor of atherosclerosisthe pathogenesis of ed is multifactorial however oxidative stress appears to be the common underlying cellular mechanism in the ensuing loss of vasoactive inflammatory haemostatic and redox homeostasis in the bodys vascular systemthe role of ed as a pathophysiological link between early endothelial cell changes associated with cardiovascular risk factors and the development of ischaemic heart disease is of importance to basic scientists and clinicians alike
