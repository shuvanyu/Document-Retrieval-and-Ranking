introduction the objective of this paper was to evaluate the relationship between urinary concentrations of insp6 bone mass loss and risk fracture in postmenopausal womenmaterials and methods a total of 157 postmenopausal women were included in the study 70 had low 076 μm 42 intermediate 076142 μm and 45 high 142 μm urinary phytate concentrationsdensitometry values for neck were measured at enrollment and after 12 months lumbar spine and femoral neck and 10year risk fracture was calculated using the tool fraxresults individuals with low insp6 levels had significantly greater bone mass loss in the lumbar spine 308  065  vs 043  055  than did those with high phytate levelsmoreover a significantly greater percentage of women with low than with high insp6 levels showed more than 2  of bone mass loss in the lumbar spine 556 vs 207 the 10year fracture probability was also significantly higher in the lowphytate group compared to the highphytate group both in hip 037  006  vs 018  004  and major osteoporotic fracture 245  024  vs 183  011 discussion it can be concluded that high urinary phytate concentrations are correlated with reduced bone mass loss in lumbar spine over 12 months and with reduced 10year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture indicating that increased phytate consumption can prevent development of osteoporosis
