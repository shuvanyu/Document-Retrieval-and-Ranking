this review describes the present state of knowledge about phytic acid phytate which is often present in legume seedsthe antinutritional effects of phytic acid primarily relate to the strong chelating associated with its six reactive phosphate groupsits ability to complex with proteins and particularly with minerals has been a subject of investigation from chemical and nutritional viewpointsthe hydrolysis of phytate into inositol and phosphates or phosphoric acid occurs as a result of phytase or nonenzymatic cleavageenzymes capable of hydrolysing phytates are widely distributed in microorganisms plants and animalsphytases act in a stepwise manner to catalyse the hydrolysis of phytic acidto reduce or eliminate the chelating ability of phytate dephosphorylation of hexa and pentaphosphate forms is essential since a high degree of phosphorylation is necessary to bind mineralsthere are several methods of decreasing the inhibitory effect of phytic acid on mineral absorption cooking germination fermentation soaking autolysisnevertheless inositol hexaphosphate is receiving increased attention owing to its role in cancer prevention andor therapy and its hypocholesterolaemic effect
