onj has been increasingly suspected to be a potential complication of bisphosphonate therapy in recent yearsthus the asbmr leadership appointed a multidisciplinary task force to address key questions related to case definition epidemiology risk factors diagnostic imaging clinical management and future areas for research related to the disorderthis report summarizes the findings and recommendations of the task forceintroduction the increasing recognition that use of bisphosphonates may be associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw onj led the leadership of the american society for bone and mineral research asbmr to appoint a task force to address a number of key questions related to this disordermaterials and methods a multidisciplinary expert group reviewed all pertinent published data on bisphosphonateassociated onjfood and drug administration drug adverse event reports were also reviewedresults and conclusions a case definition was developed so that subsequent studies could report on the same conditionthe task force defined onj as the presence of exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that did not heal within 8 wk after identification by a health care providerbased on review of both published and unpublished data the risk of onj associated with oral bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis seems to be low estimated between 1 in 10000 and 1 in 100000 patienttreatment yearshowever the task force recognized that information on incidence of onj is rapidly evolving and that the true incidence may be higherthe risk of onj in patients with cancer treated with high doses of intravenous bisphosphonates is clearly higher in the range of 110 per 100 patients depending on duration of therapyin the future improved diagnostic imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography or mri combined with contrast agents and the manipulation of image planes may identify patients at preclinical or early stages of the diseasemanagement is largely supportivea research agenda aimed at filling the considerable gaps in knowledge regarding this disorder was also outlined
