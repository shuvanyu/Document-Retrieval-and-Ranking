4methylimidazole 4mi is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals photographic chemicals dyes and pigments cleaning and agricultural chemicals and rubberit has been identified as a byproduct of fermentation in foods and has been detected in mainstream and side stream tobacco smoke4mi was studied because of its high potential for human exposuregroups of 50 male and 50 female f344n rats were fed diets containing 0 625 1250 or 2500ppm 4mi males or 0 1250 2500 or 5000ppm 4mi females for 106 weeksbased on the food consumption the calculated average daily doses were approximately 30 55 or 115 mg 4mikg body weight to males and 60 120 or 250 mg 4mikg to femalessurvival of all exposed groups of males and females was similar to that of the control groupsmean body weights of males in the 1250 and 2500ppm groups and females in the 2500 and 5000ppm groups were less than those of the control groups throughout the studyfeed consumption by 5000ppm females was less than that by the controlsclonic seizures excitability hyperactivity and impaired gait were observed primarily in 2500 and 5000ppm femalesthe incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in the 5000ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controlsthe incidences of hepatic histiocytosis chronic inflammation and focal fatty change were significantly increased in all exposed groups of male and female ratsthe incidences of hepatocellular eosinophilic and mixed cell foci were significantly increased in 2500ppm males and 5000ppm femalesgroups of 50 male and 50 female b6c3f1 mice were fed diets containing 0 312 625 or 1250ppm 4mi for 106 weeksbased on the food consumption the calculated average daily doses were approximately 40 80 or 170 mg 4mikg body weight to males and femalessurvival of all exposed groups of males and females was similar to that of the control groupsmean body weights of males and females in the 1250ppm groups and that in the 312 and 625ppm females were less than those of the control groupsfeed consumption by exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that by the controlsthe incidences of alveolarbronchiolar adenoma in all exposed groups of females alveolarbronchiolar carcinoma in 1250ppm males and alveolarbronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma combined in 1250ppm males and 625 and 1250ppm females were significantly greater than those in the control groupsthe incidence of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was significantly increased in the 1250ppm females4mi is carcinogenic inducing alveolarbronchiolar adenoma and carcinoma in male and female mice4mi may also induce mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats
