4methylimidazole 4mei is found in a wide array of food productsthe national toxicology program ntp recently conducted a twoyear feeding cancer bioassay of 4mei in b6c3f1 mice and f344n ratsin rats ntp found equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in females based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and no evidence of carcinogenic activity in maleshowever doserelated statistically significant decreases in multiple tumors were observed in both male and female rats exposed to 4mei in the ntp bioassayfor example 4mei was associated with a 25fold decrease in the incidence of mammary tumors among high dose femalesntp noted briefly that the decreases in certain tumors including mammary tumors were greater than could be attributed to body weight alonethe present paper provides a more detailed evaluation of the evidence that 4mei exhibits tumor preventive activity in the rat based upon the results of the ntp bioassayreduced body weight offers a partial explanation for the reduction in tumors but does not appear to be the primary cause of the decreased tumor incidences indicating that 4mei itself may possess an ability to prevent tumor formationcopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
