the fish ingredient n3docosahexaenoic acid 226 n3 dha stimulates brain developmenton the other hand methylmercury mehg in fish disturbs the developing central nervous systemin this context the iq score in children is considered as an aggregate measure of in utero brain developmentto determine the effect of dha exposure on prenatal neurodevelopment the maternal dha intake during pregnancy was compared with its epidemiologically observed effect on the iq score of childrenfor mehg the maternal intake was converted into its accumulation in the maternal bodythe maternal body burden then was compared with its epidemiologically observed relationship with the iq scoretaking the mehg and dha content of 33 fish species the net effect of these compounds on the iq score was quantifiedfor most fish species the adverse effect of mehg on the iq score exceeded the beneficial effect of dhain the case of longliving predators a negative effect up to 10 points on the iq score was foundthe results of this study indicate that food interventions aiming at the beneficial effects of fish consumption should focus on fish species with a high dha content while avoiding fish species with a high mehg contentcopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
