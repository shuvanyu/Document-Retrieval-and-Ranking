background methylmercury mehg is a known neurotoxicantemerging evidence indicates it may have adverse effects on the neurologic and other body systems at common low levels of exposureimpacts of mehg exposure could vary by individual susceptibility or be confounded by beneficial nutrients in fish containing mehgdespite its global relevance synthesis of the available literature on lowlevel mehg exposure has been limitedobjectives we undertook a synthesis of the current knowledge on the human health effects of lowlevel mehg exposure to provide a basis for future research efforts risk assessment and exposure remediation policies worldwidedata sources and extraction we reviewed the published literature for original human epidemiologic research articles that reported a direct biomarker of mercury exposureto focus on highquality studies and those specifically on low mercury exposure we excluded case series as well as studies of populations with unusually high fish consumption eg the seychelles marine mammal consumption eg the faroe islands circumpolar and other indigenous populations or consumption of highly contaminated fish eg goldmining regions in the amazondata synthesis recent evidence raises the possibility of effects of lowlevel mehg exposure on fetal growth among susceptible subgroups and on infant growth in the first 2 years of lifelowlevel effects of mehg on neurologic outcomes may differ by age sex and timing of exposureno clear pattern has been observed for cardiovascular disease cvd risk across populations or for specific cvd end pointsfor the few studies evaluating immunologic effects associated with mehg results have been inconsistentconclusions studies targeted at identifying potential mechanisms of lowlevel mehg effects and characterizing individual susceptibility sexual dimorphism and nonlinearity in dose response would help guide future prevention policy and regulatory efforts surrounding mehg exposure
