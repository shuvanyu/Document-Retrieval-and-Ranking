this experiment aimed to study the molecular toxicity of methylmercury mehg in liver brain and white muscle of atlantic salmon fed a diet based on fish oil fo high dietary n3n6 ratio compared to an alternative diet mainly based on vegetable oil vo low dietary n3n6 ratiojuvenile salmon were fed decontaminated diets or the fo and vo diets enriched with 5 mg hgkg added as mehg for three monthsthe dietary lipid composition affected the fatty acid composition in the tissues especially in liver and white muscleafter 84 days of exposure the liver accumulated three times as much mehg as the brain and white musclevitamin c content and heme oxygenase tubulin alpha tuba and cpt1 transcriptional levels all showed significant effects of mehg exposure in the livertbars αtocopherol γtocopherol and the transcriptional levels of thioredoxin heme oxygenase tuba pparb1 d5d and d6d showed an effect of dietary lipid composition in liver tissueeffects of dietary lipids were observed in brain tissue for mta hif1 bclx and tubainteraction effects between mehg exposure and dietary lipid composition were observed in all tissuesour data suggest that dietary fats have modulating effects on mehg toxicity in atlantic salmoncopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
