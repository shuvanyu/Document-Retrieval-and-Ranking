background prenatal exposure to mercury has been associated with adverse childhood neurologic outcomes in epidemiologic studiesdoseresponse information for this relationship is useful for estimating benefits of reduced mercury exposureobjectives we estimated a doseresponse relationship between maternal mercury body burden and subsequent childhood decrements in intelligence quotient iq using a bayesian hierarchical model to integrate data from three epidemiologic studiesmethods inputs to the model consist of doseresponse coefficients from studies conducted in the faroe islands new zealand and the seychelles islandsiq coefficients were available from previous work for the latter two studies and a coefficient for the faroe islands study was estimated from three iq subtestsother tests of cognitionachievement were included in the hierarchical model to obtain more accurate estimates of studytostudy and end pointtoend point variabilityresults we find a central estimate of 018 iq points 95 confidence interval 0378 to 0009 for each parts per million increase of maternal hair mercury similar to the estimates for both the faroe islands and seychelles studies and lower in magnitude than the estimate for the new zealand studysensitivity analyses produce similar results with the iq coefficient central estimate ranging from 013 to 025conclusions iq is a useful end point for estimating neurodevelopmental effects but may not fully represent cognitive deficits associated with mercury exposure and does not represent deficits related to attention and motor skillsnevertheless the integrated iq coefficient provides a more robust description of the doseresponse relationship for prenatal mercury exposure and cognitive functioning than results of any single study
