objective the evidence on the association between fish consumption dietary longchain n3 fatty acids and risk of type 2 diabetes is inconsistentwe therefore performed a systematic review and metaanalysis of the available prospective evidenceresearch design and methods studies were identified by searching the pubmed and embase databases through 15 december 2011 and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articlesprospective studies were included if they reported relative risk rr estimates with 95 cis for the association between fish consumption andor dietary longchain n3 fatty acids and incidence of type 2 diabetesa doseresponse randomeffects model was used to combine studyspecific rrspotential sources of heterogeneity were explored by prespecified stratificationsresults sixteen studies involving 527441 participants and 24082 diabetes cases were includedconsiderable statistical heterogeneity in the overall summary estimates was partly explained by geographical differencesfor each serving per week increment in fish consumption the rrs 95 cis of type 2 diabetes were 105 102109 103 096111 and 098 097100 combining us european and asianaustralian studies respectivelyfor each 030 g per day increment in longchain n3 fatty acids the corresponding summary estimates were 117 109126 098 070137 and 090 082098conclusions results from this metaanalysis indicate differences between geographical regions in observed associations of fish consumption and dietary intake of longchain n3 fatty acids with risk of type 2 diabetesin consideration of the heterogeneous results the relationship warrants further investigationmeanwhile current public health recommendations on fish consumption should be upheld unchanged
