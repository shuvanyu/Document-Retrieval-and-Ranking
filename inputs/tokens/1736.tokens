consumption of marine fish provides both benefits lean protein omega3 fatty acids and essential nutrients and risks main source of mercury hg exposure for humansmercury is a potent neurotoxin and the source of more fish advisories nationwide than any other toxicantdespite the widespread nature of hg it is unknown whether local hg contamination reflects national and regional levels often used as bases to inform consumers of potential fish consumption riskthus the objectives of our study were to examine hg levels of six commonly consumed marine species harvested locally off the north carolina coast and to compare our results to published regional monterey bay aquariums seafood watch list and national environmental protection agency epa and food and drug administration fda hg averages action levels and guidelineswe found significant differences in hg concentrations among collected species and we identified correlations between hg concentration and fish length and trophic levelscollected mahi mahi and triggerfish were below the epa fish tissue action level 03ppmwahoo and grouper exceeded the epa action level but were below the fda action level 10ppmking mackerel had the highest hg concentration among targeted species exceeding both epa and fda action levelsfurther our local results were not always consistent with calculated averages from epa and fda databases for the same species and although many of our findings were consistent with monterey bay aquariums seafood watch list southeast region recommendations based on hg levels would conflict with recommendations they provide based on sustainabilitywe find regional and national averages are not always reflective of local hg contamination and suggest local data may be needed to accurately assess consumer risk
