fish consumption during gestation can provide the fetus with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids lcpufa and other nutrients essential for growth and development of the brainhowever fish consumption also exposes the fetus to the neurotoxicant methyl mercury mehgwe studied the association between these fetal exposures and early child development in the seychelles child development nutrition study scdnsspecifically we examined a priori models of ω3 and ω6 lcpufa measures in maternal serum to test the hypothesis that these lcpufa families before or after adjusting for prenatal mehg exposure would reveal associations with child development assessed by the bsidii at ages 9 and 30 monthsthere were 229 children with complete outcome and covariate data available for analysisat 9 months the pdi was positively associated with total ω3 lcpufa and negatively associated with the ratio of ω6ω3 lcpufathese associations were stronger in models adjusted for prenatal mehg exposuresecondary models suggested that the mehg effect at 9 months varied by the ratio of ω6ω3 lcpufathere were no significant associations between lcpufa measures and the pdi at 30 monthsthere were significant adverse associations however between prenatal mehg and the 30 month pdi when the lcpufa measures were included in the regression analysisthe bsidii mental developmental index mdi was not associated with any exposure variablethese data support the potential importance to child development of prenatal availability of ω3 lcpufa present in fish and of lcpufa in the overall dietfurthermore they indicate that the beneficial effects of lcpufa can obscure the determination of adverse effects of prenatal mehg exposure in longitudinal observational studies
