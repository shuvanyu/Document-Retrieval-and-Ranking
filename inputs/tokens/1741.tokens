prenatal and early childhood exposure to methylmercury mehg or polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are associated with deficits in cognitive sensory motor and other functions measured by neurobehavioral teststhe main objective of this pilot study was to determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri is effective for visualization of brain function alterations related to neurobehavior in subjects with high prenatal exposure to the two neurotoxicants mehg and pcbstwelve adolescents all boys from a faroese birth cohort assembled in 19861987 were recruited based on their prenatal exposures to mehg and pcball underwent fmri scanning during behavioral tasks at age 15 yearssubjects with high mixed exposure to mehg and pcbs were compared to those with low mixed exposure on fmri photic stimulation and a motor taskboys with low mixed exposures showed patterns of fmri activation during visual and motor tasks that are typical of normal control subjectshowever those with high exposures showed activation in more areas of the brain and different and wider patterns of activation than the low mixed exposure groupthe brain activation patterns observed in association with increased exposures to mehg and pcbs are meaningful in regard to the known neurotoxicity of these substancesthis methodology therefore has potential utility in visualizing structural neural system determinants of exposureinduced neurobehavioral dysfunction
