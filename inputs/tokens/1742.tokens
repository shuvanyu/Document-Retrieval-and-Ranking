the effects of 50 mg naltrexone on eating and subjective appetite were assessed in a doubleblind placebocontrolled study with 20 male volunteersappetite was monitored using a disguised digital balance connected to a microcomputer which constantly monitored the amount of food remaining and which automatically interrupted feeding for 30 s after every 50 g consumed to allow appetite ratings to be madehalf the subjects ate pasta with a cheese sauce and the remainder pasta with a tomato saucesubjects ate significantly less of both foods after 50 mg naltrexone than in either the placebo condition or on the initial familiarisation daynaltrexone also reduced the rated pleasantness of both foods and reduced overall eating ratewhen bestfit quadratic functions were used to describe changes in rated hunger in relation to intake within the meal naltrexone abolished the positive linear component reflecting the initial stimulation of appetite without altering either intercept or the negative quadratic functionalthough mood ratings suggested that naltrexone had a mild sedative effect mood changes alone could not explain the effects of naltrexone on appetiteoverall these data suggest a specific role for opioids in the stimulation of appetite through palatability
