objective cocainerelated cues have been hypothesized to perpetuate drug abuse by inducing a craving response that prompts drugseeking behaviorhowever the mechanisms underlying neuroanatomy and specificity of this neuroanatomy are not yet fully understoodmethod to address these issues experienced cocaine users n17 and comparison subjects n14 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing three separate films that portrayed 1  individuals smoking crack cocaine 2 outdoor nature scenes and 3 explicit sexual contentcandidate craving sites were identified as those that showed significant activation in the cocaine users when viewing the cocaine filmthese sites were then required to show significantly greater activation when contrasted with comparison subjects viewing the cocaine film population specificity and cocaine users viewing the nature film content specificityresults brain regions that satisfied these criteria were largely left lateralized and included the frontal lobe medial and middle frontal gyri bilateral inferior frontal gyrus parietal lobe bilateral inferior parietal lobule insula and limbic lobe anterior and posterior cingulate gyrusof the 13 regions identified as putative craving sites just three anterior cingulate right inferior parietal lobule and the caudatelateral dorsal nucleus showed significantly greater activation during the cocaine film than during the sex film in the cocaine users which suggests that cocaine cues activated similar neuroanatomical substrates as naturally evocative stimuli in the cocaine usersfinally contrary to the effects of the cocaine film cocaine users showed a smaller response than the comparison subjects to the sex filmconclusions these data suggest that cocaine craving is not associated with a dedicated and unique neuroanatomical circuitry instead unique to the cocaine user is the ability of learned drugrelated cues to produce brain activation comparable to that seen with nondrug evocative stimuli in healthy comparison subjects
