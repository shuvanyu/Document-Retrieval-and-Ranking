tobacco smoking is the most frequent form of substance abuseseveral studies have shown that the addictive action of nicotine is mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine systemthis system is implicated in reward processingin order to better understand the relationship between nicotine addiction and reward in humans we investigated differences between smokers and nonsmokers in the activation of brain regions involved in processing reward informationusing h215o positron emission tomography pet we measured regional cerebral blood flow rcbf in healthy smokers and nonsmokers while they performed a prelearned patternrecognition taskwe compared two conditions involving nonmonetary reinforcement or monetary reward with a baseline condition in which nonsense feedback was presentedwith monetary reward we found activation in the frontal and orbitofrontal cortex occipital cortex cingulate gyrus cerebellum and midbrain in both groupsadditionally monetary reward activated typical dopaminergic regions such as the striatum in nonsmokers but not in smokerswe found a similar pattern of activation associated with nonmonetary reinforcement in nonsmokers whereas activation was found in smokers only in the cerebellumthe different patterns of activation suggest that the brains of smokers react in a different way to reward than those of nonsmokersthis difference involves in particular the regions of the dopaminergic system including the striatumin principle these observations could be interpreted either as a consequence of tobacco use or as a primitive condition of the brain that led people to smokesupported by related nonimaging studies we interpret these differences as a consequence of tobacco smoking even if a shortterm effect of smoking prior to the experiment cannot be excluded
