background weight gain leads to reduced rewardregion responsivity to energydense food receipt and consumption of an energydense diet compared with an isocaloric lowenergydensity diet leads to reduced dopamine receptorsfurthermore phasic dopamine signaling to palatable food receipt decreases after repeated intake of that food which collectively suggests that frequent intake of an energydense food may reduce striatal response to receipt of that foodobjective we tested the hypothesis that frequent ice cream consumption would be associated with reduced activation in rewardrelated brain regions eg striatum in response to receipt of an ice creambased milkshake and examined the influence of adipose tissue and the specificity of this relationdesign healthyweight adolescents n  151 underwent fmri during receipt of a milkshake and during receipt of a tasteless solutionpercentage body fat reported food intake and food craving and liking were assessedresults milkshake receipt robustly activated the striatal regions yet frequent ice cream consumption was associated with a reduced response to milkshake receipt in these rewardrelated brain regionspercentage body fat total energy intake percentage of energy from fat and sugar and intake of other energydense foods were not related to the neural response to milkshake receiptconclusions our results provide novel evidence that frequent consumption of ice cream independent of body fat is related to a reduction in rewardregion responsivity in humans paralleling the tolerance observed in drug addictiondata also imply that intake of a particular energydense food results in attenuated rewardregion responsivity specifically to that food which suggests that sensory aspects of eating and reward learning may drive the specificity
