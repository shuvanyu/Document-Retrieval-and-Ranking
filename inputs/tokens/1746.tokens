the hypothalamus is intimately involved in the regulation of food intake integrating multiple neural and hormonal signalsseveral hypothalamic nuclei contain glucosesensitive neurons which play a crucial role in energy homeostasisalthough a few functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies have indicated that glucose consumption has some effect on the neuronal activity levels in the hypothalamus this matter has not been investigated extensively yetfor instance dosedependency of the hypothalamic responses to glucose ingestion has not been addressedwe measured the effects of two different glucose loads on neuronal activity levels in the human hypothalamus using fmriafter an overnight fast the hypothalamus of 15 normal weight men was scanned continuously for 37 minafter 7 min subjects ingested either water or a glucose solution containing 25 or 75 g of glucosewe observed a prolonged decrease of the fmri signal in the hypothalamus which started shortly after subjects began drinking the glucose solution and lasted for at least 30 minmoreover the observed response was dosedependent a larger glucose load resulted in a larger signal decreasethis effect was most pronounced in the upper anterior hypothalamusin the upper posterior hypothalamus the signal decrease was similar for both glucose loadsno effect was found in the lower hypothalamuswe suggest a possible relation between the observed hypothalamic response and changes in the blood insulin concentration
