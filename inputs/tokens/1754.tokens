aims in animals intracerebroventricular glucose and fructose have opposing effects on appetite and weight regulationin humans functional brain magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies during glucose ingestion or infusion have demonstrated suppression of hypothalamic signalling but no studies have compared the effects of glucose and fructosewe therefore sought to determine if the brain response differed to glucose vs fructose in humans independently of the ingestive processmethods nine healthy normal weight subjects underwent blood oxygenation level dependent bold fmri measurements during either intravenous iv glucose 03 mgkg fructose 03 mgkg or saline administered over 2 min in a randomized doubleblind crossover studyblood was sampled every 5 min during a baseline period and following infusion for 60 min in total for glucose fructose lactate and insulin levelsresults no significant brain bold signal changes were detected in response to iv salinebold signal in the cortical control areas increased during glucose infusion p  0002 corresponding with increased plasma glucose and insulin levelsin contrast bold signal decreased in the cortical control areas during fructose infusion p  0006 corresponding with increases of plasma fructose and lactateneither glucose nor fructose infusions significantly altered bold signal in the hypothalamusconclusion in normal weight humans cortical responses as assessed by bold fmri to infused glucose are opposite to those of fructosedifferential brain responses to these sugars and their metabolites may provide insight into the neurologic basis for dysregulation of food intake during high dietary fructose intake 2011 blackwell publishing ltd
