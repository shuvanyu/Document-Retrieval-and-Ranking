context research has implicated an addictive process in the development and maintenance of obesityalthough parallels in neural functioning between obesity and substance dependence have been found no studies have examined the neural correlates of addictivelike eating behaviorobjective to test the hypothesis that elevated food addiction scores are associated with similar patterns of neural activation as substance dependencedesign betweensubjects fmri studyparticipants fortyeight healthy adolescent females ranging from lean to obese recruited for a healthy weight maintenance trialmain outcome measure the relation between elevated food addiction scores and blood oxygen leveldependent fmri activation in response to receipt and anticipated receipt of palatable food chocolate milkshakeresults food addiction scores n  39 correlated with greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex acc medial orbitofrontal cortex ofc and amygdala in response to anticipated receipt of food p 005 falsediscovery rate fdr corrected for multiple comparisons in small volumesparticipants with higher n15 versus lower n11 food addiction scores showed greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc and the caudate in response to anticipated receipt of food but less activation in the lateral ofc in response to receipt of food pfdr 005conclusions similar patterns of neural activation are implicated in addictivelike eating behavior and substance dependence elevated activation in reward circuitry in response to food cues and reduced activation of inhibitory regions in response to food intake
