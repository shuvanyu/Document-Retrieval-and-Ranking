campylobacter sppare responsible for a large number of the bacterial food poisoning cases worldwidedespite being sensitive to oxygen and nutritionally fastidious campylobacter sppare able to survive in food processing environments and reach consumers in sufficient numbers to cause diseaseto investigate campylobacter persistence on processed chicken exudates from chickens produced for consumer sale were collected and sterilizedtwo types of exudates from chicken products were collected enhanced where a marinade was added to the chickens during processing and nonenhanced where no additives were added during processingexudates from enhanced chicken products examined in this study contained a mixture of polyphosphatesexudate samples were inoculated with campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter coli strains and incubated under a range of environmental conditions and viable bacteria present in the resultant cultures were enumeratedwhen incubated at 42c in a microaerobic environment exudates from enhanced chicken products resulted in increased survival of c jejuni and c coli compared with that in nonenhanced exudates in the range of 1 to 4 log cfumlunder more relevant food storage conditions 4c and normal atmosphere the exudates from enhanced chicken products also demonstrated improved campylobacter survival compared with that in nonenhanced exudatespolyphosphates present in the enhanced exudates were determined to be largely responsible for the improved survival observed when the two types of exudates were comparedtherefore polyphosphates used to enhance chicken quality aid in sustaining the numbers of campylobacter bacteria increasing the opportunity for disease via crosscontamination or improperly cooked poultry
