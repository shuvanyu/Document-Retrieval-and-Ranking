sixty random samples of bulk farm milk market milk locally manufactured processed cheese and milk powder were collected to be analyzed for aluminum al concentration using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaasthe results were compared with provisional acceptable permissible limits paplsthe maximum estimated dietary intake medi of al for the examined samples was calculatedin addition an experimental study was conducted to determine the possible leaching of al from cookware in milk during boilingthe obtained results showed that al concentration in examined bulk farm milk samples was found to be negligiblein contrast market milk revealed higher concentration 650 of the examined samples were above the paplsthe results revealed significant difference of al concentration among themthe al levels in processed cheese wrapped in al foil were significantly higher than those found in samples packed in glass containers with a significant difference of al concentration between themalso 20 of the examined milk powder samples exceeded the papls 001 to 04 mgkgthe medi for al in bulk farm milk control market milk market milk boiled in al cookware market milk boiled in stainlesssteel cookware processed cheese wrapped in al foil processed cheese packed in glass containers and milk powder were calculated as 30 610 630 610 4280 2200 and 1660 from ptdi respectivelythe results of the experimental study showed no marked significant differences of al concentration between market milk control group and those boiled in al cookware as well as to those boiled in stainlesssteel cookwarepractical application â€‚ the results of the present study indicate that al level in milk kept in al containers and dairy products packed in al foil is beyond the permissible limits suggesting health hazardtherefore all milk cans should be constructed of stainless steel prevent the entrance of tap water into milk and the processed cheese should be packed in glass containers and not wrapped in al foilleaching of al increased to a significant percent more during storage than during boiling so milk should be kept in stainless steel or glass containers in the refrigerator
