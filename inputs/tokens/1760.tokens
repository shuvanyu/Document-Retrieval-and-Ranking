objective phosphorus containing additives are increasingly added to food productswe sought to determine the potential impact of these additiveswe focused on chicken products as an examplemethods we purchased a variety of chicken products prepared them according to package directions and performed laboratory analyses to determine their actual phosphorus contentwe used esha food processor sql software to determine the expected phosphorus content of each productresults of 38 chicken products 35 92 had phosphorus containing additives listed among their ingredientsfor every category of chicken products containing additives the actual phosphorus content was greater than the content expected from nutrient databasefor example actual phosphorus content exceeded expected phosphorus content by an average of 84 mg100g for breaded breast stripsthere was also a great deal of variation within each categoryfor example the difference between actual and expected phosphorus content ranged from 59 to 165 mg100g for breast pattiestwo 100 g servings of additive containing products contain an average of 440 mg of phosphorus or about half the total daily recommended intake for dialysis patientsconclusion phosphorus containing additives significantly increase the amount of phosphorus in chicken productsavailable nutrient databases do not reflect this higher phosphorus content and the variation between similar products makes it impossible for patients and dietitians to accurately estimate phosphorus contentwe recommend that dialysis patients limit their intake of additive containing products and that the phosphorus content of food products be included on nutrition facts labels
