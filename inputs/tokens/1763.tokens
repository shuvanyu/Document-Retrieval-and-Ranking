background restriction of dietary phosphorus is a major aspect of patient care in those with renal diseaserestriction of dietary phosphorus is necessary to control for phosphate balance during both conservative therapy and dialysis treatmentthe extra amount of phosphorus which is consumed as a result of phosphatecontaining food additives is a real challenge for patients with renal disease and for dieticians because it represents a hidden phosphate loadthe objective of this study was to measure phosphorus content in foods common protein sources in particular and comprised both those which included a listing of phosphate additives and those which did notmethods determinations of dry matter nitrogen total and soluble phosphate ions were carried out in 60 samples of foods namely cooked ham roast breast turkey and roast breast chicken of which 30 were with declared phosphate additives and the other 30 similar items were without additivesresults total phosphorus 290  40 mg100 g vs 185  23 mg100 g p  001 and soluble phosphorus 164  25 mg100 g vs 100  19 mg100 g p  001 content were higher in products containing additives than in foods without additivesno difference was detected between the 2 groups regarding dry matter 272  20 g100 g vs 267  19 g100 g or total nitrogen 315  040 g100 g vs 319  040 g100 gconsequently phosphorus intake per gram of protein was much greater in the foods containing phosphorus additives 150  31 mgg vs 93  07 mgg p  001conclusions our results show that those foods which contain phosphate additives have a phosphorus content nearly 70 higher than the samples which did not contain additivesthis creates a special concern because this extra amount of phosphorus is almost completely absorbed by the intestinal tractthese hidden phosphates worsen phosphate balance control and increase the need for phosphate binders and related costsinformation and educational programs are essential to make patients with renal disease aware of the existence of foods with phosphate additivesmoreover these facts highlight the need for national and international authorities to devote more attention to food labels which should clearly report the amount of natural or added phosphoruscopyright  2011 national kidney foundation incpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
