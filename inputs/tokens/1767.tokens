background and objectives uncooked meat and poultry products are commonly enhanced by food processors using phosphate saltsthe addition of potassium and phosphorus to these foods has been recognized but not quantifieddesign setting participants  measurements we measured the phosphorus potassium and protein content of 36 uncooked meat and poultry products phosphorus using the association of analytical communities aoac official method 98427 potassium using aoac official method 98501 and protein using aoac official method 99003results products that reported the use of additives had an average phosphateprotein ratio 28 higher than additive free products the content ranged up to almost 100 higherpotassium content in foods with additives varied widely additive free products all contained 387 mg100 g whereas five of the 25 products with additives contained at least 692 mg100 g maximum 930 mg100 gmost but not all foods with phosphate and potassium additives reported the additives unquantified on the labeling eight of 25 enhanced products did not list the additivesthe results cannot be applied to other productsthe composition of the food additives used by food processors may change over timeconclusions uncooked meat and poultry products that are enhanced may contain additives that increase phosphorus and potassium content by as much as almost two and threefold respectively this modification may not be discernible from inspection of the food label
