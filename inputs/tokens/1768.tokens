aim of the study drinking camel urine has been used traditionally to treat numerous cases of cancer yet the exact mechanism was not investigatedtherefore we examined the ability of three different camel urines virgin lactating and pregnant source to modulate a wellknown canceractivating enzyme the cytochrome p450 1a1 cyp1a1 in murine hepatoma hepa 1c1c7 cell linematerials and methods the effect of different camel urines compared to bovine urines on cyp1a1 mrna was determined using realtime polymerase chain reactioncyp1a1 protein and catalytic activity levels were determined using western blot analysis and 7ethoxyresorufin as a substrate respectivelythe role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahrdependent mechanism was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay emsa and the ahrdependent luciferase reporter generesults all types of camel but not bovine urines differentially inhibited the induction of cyp1a1 gene expression by tcdd the most potent cyp1a1 inducer and known carcinogenic chemicalimportantly virgin camel urine showed the highest degree of inhibition at the activity level followed by lactating and pregnant camel urinesfurthermore we have shown that virgin camel urine significantly inhibited the tcddmediated induction of cyp1a1 at the mrna and protein expression levelsmechanistically the ability of virgin camel urine to inhibit cyp1a1 was strongly correlated with its ability to inhibit ahrdependent luciferase activity and dna binding as determined by emsa suggesting that ahrdependent mechanism is involvedconclusions the present work provides the first evidence that camel urine but not that of bovine inhibits the tcddmediated toxic effect by inhibiting the expression of cyp1a1 at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels through an ahrdependent mechanismcopyright  2010 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
