dioxins invade the body mainly through the diet and produce toxicity through the transformation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahran inhibitor of the transformation should therefore protect against the toxicity and ideally be part of the dietwe examined flavonoids ubiquitously expressed in plant foods as one of the best candidates and found that the subclasses flavones and flavonols suppressed antagonistically the transformation of ahr induced by 1 nm of 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin without exhibiting agonistic effects that transform ahrthe antagonistic ic50 values ranged from 014 to 10 microm close to the physiological levels in human
