purpose of review the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr a transcription factor activated by a large number of environmental agents modulates the activity of immune and nonimmune cells in the gut and may represent an important link between the environment and the immune perturbations which underlie the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseasethis review will summarize the current knowledge of the role of ahr in regulation of intestinal immune homeostasis and inflammationrecent findings activation of ahr by dietary ligands is necessary for the maintenance or expansion of innate immune cells in the gut such as intraepithelial lymphocytes iels and interleukin il22producing lymphoid cells ilc22ahrdeficient mice lack iels have reduced number of ilc22 cells and are more susceptible to bacterial infections and experimental colitisin animal models ahr activators inhibit proinflammatory cytokine synthesis and attenuate colitis by a pathway that involves il22analysis of ahr in the human gut reveals that intestinal t cells and natural killer cells isolated from crohns disease patients express low levels of ahr and respond to ahr ligands by downregulating inflammatory cytokines and upregulating il22summary these novel findings may help explain how environmental factors may regulate mucosal immune responses
