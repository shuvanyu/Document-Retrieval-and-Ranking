introduction much of our knowledge and treatment of complicated diverticulitis cd are based on outdated literature reporting mortality rates of 10practice parameters recommend elective resection after 2 episodes of diverticulitis to reduce morbidity and mortalitythe aim of this study is to update our understanding of the morbidity mortality characteristics and outcomes of cdmethods three hundred thirtyseven patients hospitalized for cd were retrospectively analyzedcharacteristics and outcomes were determined using chisquared and fisher exact testsresults mean age of patients was 65 yearsseventy percent had one or more comorbiditiesa total of 466 had a history of at least one prior diverticulitis episode whereas 534 presented with cd as their first episodeoverall mortality rate was 65 864 associated with perforation 95 anastomotic leak 45 patient managed nonoperativelya total of 895 of the perforation patients who died had no history of diverticulitissteroid use was significantly associated with perforation rates as well as mortality p 0001 and p  0002comorbidities such as diabetes collagenvascular disease and immune system compromise were also highly associated with death p  0006 p  0009 and p  0003 respectivelyoverall morbidity was 414older age gender steroids comorbidities and perforation were significantly associated with morbidityconclusion today mortality from cd excluding perforation is reduced compared with past datathis coupled with the fact that the majority of these patients presented with cd as their first episode calls into question the current practice of elective resection as a stratagem for reducing mortalityimmunocompromised patients may benefit from early resectionnew prospective data is needed to redefine target groups for prophylactic resection
