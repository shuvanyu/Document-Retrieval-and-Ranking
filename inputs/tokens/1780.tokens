the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr is a ligandactivated transcription factor present in many cellsthe ahr links environmental chemical stimuli with adaptive responses such as detoxification cellular homoeostasis or immune responsesfurthermore novel roles of ahr in physiological and genetic functions are being discoveredthis is a report of a recent meeting in d√ºsseldorfthe meeting highlighted that ahr research has moved from its focus on toxic effects of dioxins and other environmental pollutants to its biological rolesfor instance it was recently discovered that ahrresponsive elements in retrotransposons contribute to the functional structure of the genomeother exciting new reports concerned the way plantderived compounds in our diet are necessary for a fully functioning immune system of the gutalso human brain tumours use the ahr system to gain growth advantagesother aspects covered were neurotoxicology the circadian rhythm or the breadth of the adaptive and innate immune system hematopoietic stem cells dendritic cells t cells mast cellsfinally the meeting dealt with the discovery of new xenobiotic and natural ligands and their use in translational medicine or cancer biology and ahr
