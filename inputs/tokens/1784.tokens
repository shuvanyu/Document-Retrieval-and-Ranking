brca1 mutations have been associated with hereditary breast cancer onlyrecent studies indicate that a subgroup of sporadic breast cancer might also be associated with reduction in brca1 mrna levels and protein expressionhowever the mechanism of reduced mrna and protein expression is yet not fully elucidatedthis study aims to assess brca1 protein expression and the role of brca1 promoter methylation in sporadic breast cancer in north indian population and to correlate these with known prognostic factors and molecular profiles of breast cancerbrca1 protein expression was normal 50  tumour cells in 41 43  cases reduced 2050  tumour cells in 33 35  cases and absentmarkedly reduced 20  tumour cells in 21 221  casescases which were negative for brca1 protein were more frequently positive for basal markers 29 versus 5  and were more often ernegative 62 versus 39  than brca1positive tumoursmethylation of brca1 promoter region was seen in 1145 cases 24 all 11 cases showing brca1 methylation had absent eight cases or reduced three cases brca1 protein expressionbrca1 proteinnegative tumours were more frequently basal markerpositive and ernegative highlighting the brcaness of sporadic breast cancer with loss of brca1 protein expression through promoter hypermethylation similar to hereditary breast cancer with brca1 mutationsloss of brca1 in sporadic breast cancer suggests that therapeutics targeting brca1 pathway in hereditary breast cancer like parp inhibitors might be used as therapeutic targets for sporadic breast tumours
