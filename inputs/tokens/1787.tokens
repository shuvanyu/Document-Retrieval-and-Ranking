background only 5 of all breast cancers are the result of brca12 mutationsmethylation silencing of tumor suppressor genes is well described in sporadic breast cancer however its role in familial breast cancer is not knownmethods cpg island promoter methylation was tested in the initial random periareolar fineneedle aspiration sample from 109 asymptomatic women at high risk for breast cancerpromoter methylation targets included rarb m3 and m4 esr1 ink4aarf brca1 pra prb rassf1a hin1 and crbp1results although the overall frequency of cpg island promoter methylation events increased with age p  00001 no specific methylation event was associated with agein contrast cpg island methylation of rarb m4 p  0051 ink4aarf p  0042 hin1 p  0044 and pra p  0032 as well as the overall frequency of methylation events p  0004 was associated with abnormal masood cytologythe association between promoter methylation and familial breast cancer was tested in 40 unaffected premenopausal women in our cohort who underwent brca12 mutation testingwomen with brca12 mutations had a low frequency of cpg island promoter methylation 15 of 15 women had 4 methylation events whereas women without a mutation showed a high frequency of promoter methylation events 24 of 25 women had 58 methylation events p  00001of women with a brca12 mutation none showed methylation of hin1 and only 1 of 15 women showed cpg island methylation of rarb m4 ink4aarf or prb promotersconclusions this is the first evidence of cpg island methylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters in nonbrca12 familial breast cancer
