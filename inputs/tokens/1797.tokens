urine morphine levels after the consumption of poppy seeds were measured in two separate trialsmaximum levels of approximately 18 microgramsml were found using ria emitst and gc methodologiespositive immunoassay results were seen up to 60 h postingestionseveral different lots of seeds from various sources were assayed for morphine and found to range from 4200 mgkgdifferentiation of poppy seed eaters from opiate users was not possible via the identification of minor alkaloid constituents of poppy seedsit is however possible to analyse opiate urines with respect to 6oacetylmorphinebelow the level of approximately 5 microgramsml total opiates gcms is the method of choice for this analysis
