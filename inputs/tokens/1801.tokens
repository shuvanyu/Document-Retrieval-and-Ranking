background exercise can alter health in children in both beneficial eg reduced longterm risk of atherosclerosis and adverse eg exerciseinduced asthma waysthe mechanisms linking exercise and health are not known but may rest partly on the ability of exercise to increase circulating immune cellslittle is known about the effect of brief exercise more reflective of naturally occurring patterns of physical activity in children on immune cell responsesobjectives to determine whether 1 a 6min bout of exercise can increase circulating inflammatory cells in healthy children and 2 the effect of brief exercise is greater in children with a history of asthmamethods children with mildmoderate persistent asthma and agematched controls n  14 in each group mean age 136 years performed a 6min bout of cycleergometer exercisespirometry was performed at baseline and after exerciseblood was drawn before and after exercise leucocytes were quantified and key lymphocyte cell surface markers were assessed by flow cytometryresults exercise decreased spirometry only in children with asthma but increased p0001 most types of leucocytes eg lymphocytes controls mean sd 1210 208 cellsμl children with asthma 1119 147 cellsμl and eosinophils controls 104 22 cellsμl children with asthma 88 20 cellsμl to the same degree in both groupssimilarly exercise increased t helper cells controls 248 60 cellsμl children with asthma 232 53 cellsμl and most other lymphocyte subtypes testedby contrast although basophils 16 5 cellsμl and cd4 cd45ro ra lymphocytes 19 4 cellsμl increased in controls no increase in these cell types was found in children with asthmaconclusions exercise increased many circulating inflammatory cells in both children with asthma and controlscirculating inflammatory cells did increase in children with asthma but not to a greater degree than in controlsin fact basophils and t helper lymphocyte memory transition cells did not increase in children with asthma whereas they did increase in controlseven brief exercise in children and adolescents robustly mobilises circulating immune cells
