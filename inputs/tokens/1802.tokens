strenuous aerobic exercise is known to weaken the immune system and while many nutritional supplements have been proposed to boost postexercise immunity few are known to be effectivethe purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether 10 d of supplementation with a defined source of bakers yeast βglucan bg wellmune wgp could minimise postexercise immunosuppressionrecreationally active men and women n 60 completed two 10 d trial conditions using a crossover design with a 7 d washout period placebo rice flour and bakers yeast bg 250 mgd of β1316glucans derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae before a bout of cycling 49  6 min in a hot 38  2c humid 45  2  relative humidity environmentblood was collected at baseline before supplement pre pre post post and 2 h 2h postexercisetotal and subset monocyte concentration was measured by fourcolour flow cytometryplasma cytokine levels and lipopolysaccharide lpsstimulated cytokine production were measured using separate multiplex assaystotal cd14 and proinflammatory monocyte concentrations cd14cd16 were significantly greater at post and 2h p005 with bg supplementationbg supplementation boosted lpsstimulated production of il2 il4 il5 and interferonγ ifnγ at pre and post p005plasma il4 il5 and ifnγ concentrations were greater at 2h following bg supplementationit appears that 10 d of supplementation with bg increased the potential of blood leucocytes for the production of il2 il4 il5 and ifnγthe key findings of the present study demonstrate that bg may have potential to alter immunity following a strenuous exercise session
