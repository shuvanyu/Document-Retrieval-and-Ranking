senescent tcells accumulate with age lowering the na誰ve tcell repertoire and increasing host infection riskas this response is likely to be influenced by certain lifestyle factors we examined the association between aerobic fitness vo2max and the agerelated accumulation of senescent tcellsblood lymphocytes from 102 healthy males 1861 yr were analyzed for klrg1 cd57 cd28 cd45ra cd45ro surface expression on cd4 and cd8 tcells by 4color flow cytometryadvancing age yr was positively associated with the proportion  of senescent klrg1cd57 klrg1cd28 cd4 b100 102 and cd8 b0429 102 tcells and inversely associated with na誰ve klrg1cd28 cd4 b1000 and cd8 b0993 tcellsvo2max was inversely associated with senescent cd4 b097 and cd8 b0240strikingly age was no longer associated with the proportions of senescent or na誰ve tcells after adjusting for vo2max while the association between vo2max and these tcell subsets withstood adjustment for age bmi and percentage body fatranking participants by ageadjusted vo2max revealed that the highest tertile had 17 more na誰ve cd8 tcells and 57 and 37 less senescent cd4 and cd8 tcells respectively compared to the lowest tertilevo2max was not associated with latent cytomegalovirus cmv epsteinbarr virus ebv or herpes simplex virus1 hsv1 infection indicating that the moderating associations of vo2max were not confounded by persistent viral infectionsthis is the first study to show that aerobic fitness is associated with a lower agerelated accumulation of senescent tcells highlighting the beneficial effects of maintaining a physically active lifestyle on the aging immune systemcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
