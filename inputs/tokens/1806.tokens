exerciseinduced oxidative stress is instrumental in achieving the health benefits from regular exercisetherefore inappropriate use of fruitderived products commonly applied as prophalytic antioxidants may counteract the positive effects of exerciseusing human exercise and cellular models we found that 1 blackcurrant supplementation suppressed exerciseinduced oxidative stress eg plasma carbonyls 09  01 vs 06  01 nmolmg protein placebo vs blackcurrant and 2 preincubation of thp1 cells with an anthocyaninrich blackcurrant extract inhibited lpsstimulated cytokine secretion tnfalpha 16453  322 vs 10941  82 pgml control vs extract p  005 and il6 476  14 vs 326  32 pgml control vs extract p  005 and nfkappab activationin addition to its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties we found that postexercise plasma collected after blackcurrant supplementation enhanced the differential temporal lpsstimulated inflammatory response in thp1 cells resulting in an early suppression of tnfalpha 1741  32 vs 1312  42 pgml placebo vs blackcurrant p  005 and il6 44  5 vs 36  3 pgml placebo vs blackcurrant p  005 secretion after 24 h furthermore by using an oxidative stress cell model we found that preincubation of thp1 cells with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 prior to extract exposure caused a greater suppression of lpsstimulated cytokine secretion after 24 h which was not evident when cells were simultaneously incubated with h2o2 and the extractin summary our findings support the concept that consumption of blackcurrant anthocyanins alleviate oxidative stress and may if given at the appropriate amount and time complement the ability of exercise to enhance immune responsiveness to potential pathogens
