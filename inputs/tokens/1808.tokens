various dietary flavonoids were evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory effect on xanthine oxidase which has been implicated in oxidative injury to tissue by ischemiareperfusionxanthine oxidase activity was determined by directly measuring uric acid formation by hplcthe structureactivity relationship revealed that the planar flavones and flavonols with a 7hydroxyl group such as chrysin luteolin kaempferol quercetin myricetin and isorhamnetin inhibited xanthine oxidase activity at low concentrations ic50 values from 040 to 502 microm in a mixedtype mode while the nonplanar flavonoids isoflavones and anthocyanidins were less inhibitorythese results suggest that certain flavonoids might suppress in vivo the formation of active oxygen species and urate by xanthine oxidase
