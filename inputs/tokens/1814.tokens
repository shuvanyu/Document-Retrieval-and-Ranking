legumes and the polyphenolic compounds present in them have gained a lot of interest due to their beneficial health implicationsdietary polyphenolic compounds especially flavonoids exert antioxidant properties and are potent inhibitors of xanthine oxidase xo activityxo is the main contributor of free radicals during exercise but it is also involved in pathogenesis of several diseases such as vascular disorders cancer and goutin order to discover new natural dietary xo inhibitors some polyphenolic fractions and pure compounds isolated from two legume plant extracts were tested for their effects on xo activitythe fractions isolated from both vicia faba and lotus edulis plant extracts were potent inhibitors of xo with ic50 values range from 40135 µgml and 55260 µgml respectivelyall the pure polyphenolic compounds inhibited xo and their ki values ranged from 13767 µmten of the compounds followed the non competitive inhibitory model whereas one of them was a competitive inhibitorthese findings indicate that flavonoid isolates from legume plant extracts are novel natural xo inhibitorstheir mode of action is under investigation in order to examine their potential in drug design for diseases related to overwhelming xo action
