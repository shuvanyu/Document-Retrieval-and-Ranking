background anecdotal reports and a single casecontrol epidemiological survey have suggested an association between the helminthic disease neurocysticercosis and primary headachethe present study was undertaken to determine whether neurocysticercosis is more common among patients with primary headaches than in other neurological disordersmethods we determined the prevalence of neurocysticercosis in a cohort of patients with primary headache who were seen at our institution over a 20year periodwe used as controls all people from the same cohort with four major different categories of neurological disorders including cerebrovascular disease degenerative disorders of the cns head trauma and primary brain tumorswe evaluated differences in the prevalence of neurocysticercosis between patients and controlsresults fortyeight of 1017 patients with primary headache and 31 of 1687 controls had neurocysticercosis 47 vs 18 p  00001calcified parenchymal brain cysticerci were more frequent among patients with primary headache than in those with cerebrovascular disease 47 vs 1 p  0001 degenerative disorders of the cns 47 vs 24 p  005 and head trauma 47 vs 23 p  005there were no significant differences however for the subset of controls with primary brain tumors 47 vs 35 a condition that has also been associated with neurocysticercosisconclusions there is a relationship between calcified neurocysticercosis and primary headache disordersit is possible that periodic remodeling of cysticercotic calcifications with liberation of antigens to the brain parenchyma contributes to the occurrence of headache in these patients
