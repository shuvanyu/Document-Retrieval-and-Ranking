neurocysticercosis ncc is an infection of the central nervous system cns caused by the metacestode larval form of the parasite taenia spmany factors can contribute to the endemic nature of cysticercosisthe inflammatory process that occurs in the tissue surrounding the parasite andor distal from it can result from several associated mechanisms and may be disproportionate with the number of cyststhis discrepancy may lead to difficulty with the proper diagnosis in people from low endemic regions or regions that lack laboratory resourcesin the cns the cysticerci have two basic forms isolated cysts cysticercus cellulosaecc and racemose cysts cysticercus racemosuscr and may be meningeal parenchymal or ventricular or have a mixed locationthe clinical manifestations are based on two fundamental syndromes that may occur in isolation or be associated epilepsy and intracranial hypertensionthey may be asymptomatic symptomatic or fatal have an acute subacute or chronic picture or may be in remission or exacerbatedthe cerebrospinal fluid csf may be normal even in patients with viable cysticerci until the patients begin to exhibit the classical syndrome of ncc in the csf or show changes in one or more routine analysed parameterscomputed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri have allowed noninvasive diagnoses but can lead to false negativestreatment is a highly controversial issue and is characterised by individualised therapy sessionstwo drugs are commonly used praziquantel pzq and albendazole abzthe choice of antiinflammatory drugs includes steroids and dextrochlorpheniramine dcphydrocephalus is a common secondary effect of nccsurgical cases of hydrocephalus must be submitted to ventricleperitoneal shunt vps immediately before cysticidal treatment and surgical extirpation of the cyst may lead to an absence of the surrounding inflammatory processthe progression of ncc may be simple or complicated have remission with or without treatment and may exhibit symptoms that can disappear for long periods of time or persist until deathunknown neglected and controversial aspects of ncc such as the impaired fourth ventricle syndrome the presence of chronic brain oedema and psychic complaints in addition to the lack of detectable glucose in the csf and reinfection are discussed
