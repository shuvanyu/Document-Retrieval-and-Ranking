background despite its high content of saturated fatty acids cheese does not seem to increase plasma total and ldlcholesterol concentrations when compared with an equivalent intake of fat from butterthis effect may be due to the high calcium content of cheese which results in a higher excretion of fecal fatobjectives the objective was to compare the effects of diets of equal fat content rich in either hard cheese or butter or a habitual diet on blood pressure and fasting serum blood lipids creactive protein glucose and insulinwe also examined whether fecal fat excretion differs with the consumption of cheese or butterdesign the study was a randomized dietary intervention consisting of two 6wk crossover periods and a 14d runin period during which the subjects consumed their habitual dietthe study included 49 men and women who replaced part of their habitual dietary fat intake with 13 of energy from cheese or butterresults after 6 wk the cheese intervention resulted in lower serum total ldl and hdlcholesterol concentrations and higher glucose concentrations than did the butter interventioncheese intake did not increase serum total or ldlcholesterol concentrations compared with the runin period during which total fat and saturated fat intakes were lowerfecal fat excretion did not differ between the cheese and butter periodsconclusion cheese lowers ldl cholesterol when compared with butter intake of equal fat content and does not increase ldl cholesterol compared with a habitual dietthis trial is registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct01140165
