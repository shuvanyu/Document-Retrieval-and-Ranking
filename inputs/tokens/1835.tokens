1the effects of grapefruit juice and naringenin on the activity of the human cytochrome p450 isoform cyp1a2 were evaluated using caffeine as a probe substrate2in vitro naringin was a potent competitive inhibitor of caffeine 3demethylation by human liver microsomes ki  729 microm3in vivo grapefruit juice 12 l day1 containing 05 g l1 naringin the glycone form of naringenin decreased the oral clearance of caffeine by 23 95 ci 730 and prolonged its halflife by 31 95 ci 2044 n  124we conclude that grapefruit juice and naringenin inhibit cyp1a2 activity in manhowever the small effect on caffeine clearance in vivo suggests that in general the ingestion of grapefruit juice should not cause clinically significant inhibition of the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of cypia2
