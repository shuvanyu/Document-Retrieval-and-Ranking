the effects of grapefruit juice on the bioavailability of 17 alphaethinylestradiol ee2 after a single oral administration of 50 micrograms ee2 have been investigatedthe pharmacokinetics of ee2 were studied in an open randomized crossover study in which 13 healthy volunteers were administered the drug with herbal tea or grapefruit juice naringin 887 mgmlin contrast to herbal tea grapefruit juice increased the peak plasma concentration cmax significantly to 137 mean range 64 to 214 p  00088 and increased the area under plasma concentrationtime curve from 0 to 8 hours auc08 to 128 mean range 81 to 180 p  00186this study shows that grapefruit juice increases the bioavailable amount of ee2a possible explanation may be that grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolic degradation of ee2whether the increased bioavailability of ee2 following grapefruit juice administration is of clinical importance should be investigated in longterm studies
