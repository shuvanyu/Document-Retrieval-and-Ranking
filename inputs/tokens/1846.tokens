to investigate whether systemic acidbase equilibrium changes with aging in normal adult humans we reviewed published articles reporting the acidbase composition of arterial arterialized venous or capillary blood in ageidentified healthy subjectswe extracted or calculated blood hydrogen ion concentration h plasma bicarbonate concentration hco3 blood pco2 and age and computed a total of 61 agegroup means distributed among eight 10year intervals from age 20 to 100 yearsusing linear regression analysis we found that with increasing age there is a significant increase in the steadystate blood h p  001 and reduction in steadystate plasma hco3 p  001 indicative of a progressively worsening lowlevel metabolic acidosisblood pco2 decreased with age p  05 in keeping with the expected respiratory adaptation to metabolic acidosissuch agerelated increasing metabolic acidosis may reflect in part the normal decline of renal function with increasing agethe role of agerelated metabolic acidosis in the pathogenesis of the degenerative diseases of aging warrants consideration
