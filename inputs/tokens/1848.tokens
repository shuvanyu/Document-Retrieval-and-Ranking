background the finding reported in a previous paper  alkalization of urine facilitates uric acid excretion  is contradictory to what one might expect to occur because food materials for the alkalization of urine contain fewer purine bodies than those for acidification less uric acid in alkaline urine should have been excreted than in acid urineto make clear what component of uric acid excretion mechanisms is responsible for this unexpected finding we simultaneously collected data for the concentration of both creatinine and uric acid in serum as well as in urine in order to calculate both uric acid and creatinine clearancesmethods within the framework of the japanese governments health promotion program we made recipes which consisted of proteinrich and less vegetablefruit food materials for h  load acidic diet and others composed of less protein and more vegetablefruit rich food materials alkaline dietthis is a crossover study within some limitationshealthy female students who had no medical problems at the regular physical examination provided by the university were enrolled in this consecutive 5day study for each testfrom wholeday collected urine total volume ph organic acid creatinine uric acid titratable acid and all cations nakca2mg2nh4 and anions clso42po4 necessary for the estimation of acidbase balance were measuredin the early morning before breakfast of the 1st 3rd and 5th experimental day we sampled 5 ml of blood to estimate the creatinine and uric acid concentration in serumresults and discussion urine ph reached a steady state 3 days after switching from ordinary daily diets to specified regimensthe amount of acid generated so42  organic acid  gut alkaliwas linearly related with the excretion of acid titratable acid  nh4  hco3 indicating that h  in urine is generated by the metabolic degradation of food materialsuric acid and excreted urine ph retained a linear relationship as reported previouslyamong the five factors which are associated with calculating clearances for both uric acid and creatinine we identified a conspicuous difference between acidic and alkaline diets in the uric acid concentration in serum as well as in urine uric acid in the serum was higher in the acidic group than in the alkaline group while uric acid in the urine in the acidic group was lower than that in the alkaline groupthese changes of uric acid in acidic urine and in serum were reflected in the reduction of its clearancefrom these observations it is considered that uric acid may be reabsorbed more actively in acidic urine than in alkaline urineconclusion we conclude that alkalization of urine by eating nutritionally welldesigned alkaline prone food is effective for removing uric acid from the body
