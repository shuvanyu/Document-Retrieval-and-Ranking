there is strong evidence indicating that elevated plasma total homocysteine thcy levels are a major independent biomarker andor a contributor to chronic conditions such as cvda deficiency of vitamin b₁₂ can elevate homocysteinevegetarians are a group of the population who are potentially at greater risk of vitamin b₁₂ deficiency than omnivoresthis is the first systematic review and metaanalysis to appraise a range of studies that compared the homocysteine and vitamin b₁₂ levels of vegetarians and omnivoresthe search methods employed identified 443 entries from which by screening using set inclusion and exclusion criteria six eligible cohort case studies and eleven crosssectional studies from 1999 to 2010 were revealed which compared concentrations of plasma thcy and serum vitamin b₁₂ of omnivores lactovegetarians or lactoovovegetarians and vegansof the identified seventeen studies 3230 participants only two studies reported that vegan concentrations of plasma thcy and serum vitamin b₁₂ did not differ from omnivoresthe present study confirmed that an inverse relationship exists between plasma thcy and serum vitamin b₁₂ from which it can be concluded that the usual dietary source of vitamin b₁₂ is animal products and those who choose to omit or restrict these products are destined to become vitamin b₁₂ deficientat present the available supplement which is usually used for fortification of food is the unreliable cyanocobalamina welldesigned study is needed to investigate a reliable and suitable supplement to normalise the elevated plasma thcy of a high majority of vegetariansthis would fill the gaps in the present nutritional scientific knowledge
