although highprotein diets induce hypercalciuria in humans the source of the additional urinary calcium remains unclearone hypothesis is that the high endogenous acid load of a highprotein diet is partially buffered by bone leading to increased skeletal resorption and hypercalciuriawe used dual stable calcium isotopes to quantify the effect of a highprotein diet on calcium kinetics in womenthe study consisted of 2 wk of a leadin wellbalanced diet followed by 10 d of an experimental diet containing either moderate 10 gkg or high 21 gkg proteinthirteen healthy women received both levels of protein in random orderintestinal calcium absorption increased during the highprotein diet in comparison with the moderate 262  19 vs 185  16 p  00001 mean  sem as did urinary calcium 523  037 vs 357  035 mmold p  00001 mean  semthe highprotein diet caused a significant reduction in the fraction of urinary calcium of bone origin and a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the rate of bone turnoverthere were no proteininduced effects on net bone balancethese data directly demonstrate that at least in the short term highprotein diets are not detrimental to bone
