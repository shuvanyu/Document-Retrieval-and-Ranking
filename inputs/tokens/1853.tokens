objective diet affects urine ph and acidbase balanceboth excess acidalkaline ash eaa and estimated net acid excretion nae calculations have been used to estimate the effects of diet on urine phthis studys goal was to determine if freeliving vegans lactoovo vegetarians and omnivores have increasingly acidic urine and to assess the ability of eaa and estimated nae calculations to predict urine phdesign this study used a crosssectional designsetting and participants this study assessed urine samples of 10 vegan 16 lactoovo vegetarian and 16 healthy omnivorous women in the boston metropolitan areasix 3day food records from each dietary group were analyzed for eaa content and estimated nae and correlations with measured urine ph were calculatedresults the mean  sd urine ph was 615  040 for vegans 590  036 for lactoovo vegetarians and 574  021 for omnivores analysis of variance p  013calculated eaa values were not significantly different among the three groups whereas mean estimated nae values were significantly different 173  145 meqday for vegans 313  85 meqday for lactoovo vegetarians and 426  132 meqday for omnivores analysis of variance p  01the average deattenuated correlation between urine ph and eaa was 0333 this value was 0768 for estimated nae and urine ph with a regression equation of ph  633  0014 nae p  02 r  054conclusions habitual diet and estimated nae calculations indicate the probable ranking of urine ph by dietary groups and may be used to determine the likely acidbase status of an individual eaa calculations were not predictive of urine ph
