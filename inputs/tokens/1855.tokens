high dietary acid load dal may be detrimental to bone mineral density bmdthe objectives of the study were to 1 evaluate the crosssectional relation between dal and bmd 2 determine whether calcium intake modifies this associationmen n1218 and women n907 60y were included from the national health and nutrition examination survey 20052008nutrient intake from 224h recalls was used to calculate net endogenous acid production neap and potential renal acid load pral meqdpral was calculated from dietary calcium praldiet and diet  supplemental calcium praltotaltests for linear trend in adjusted mean bmd of the hip and lumbar spine were performed across energy adjusted neap and pral quartilesmodification by calcium intake dietary or total above or below 800 mgd was assessed by interaction termsoverall mean age was 69  03yamong women there was no association between neap and bmdpraldiet was positively associated with proximal femur bmd p trend004no associations were observed with praltotal at any bmd site prange 038082among men no significant associations were observed of bmd with neap or pralhowever an interaction between praldiet and calcium intake was observed with proximal femur bmd p008an inverse association between praldiet and proximal femur bmd was detected among men 800 mgd dietary calcium p002 and no associations 800 mgd p098a significant interaction with praltotal was not observedin conclusion when supplemental calcium is considered there is no association between dal and bmd among adultsmen with low dietary calcium showed an inverse relation with pral at the proximal femur in women no interaction was observedthis study highlights the importance of calcium intakes in counteracting the adverse effect of dal on bone healthfurther research should determine the relation between dal and change in bmd with very low calcium intake
