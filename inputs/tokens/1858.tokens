a first objective of the present study was to estimate the acidbase balance of the food intake in vegetarians and nonvegetariansa second objective was to evaluate if additional input of specific food items on the existing potential renal acid load pral list was necessary for the comparison of the two dietary patternsthirty vegetarians between the age of 18 and 30 years were matched for sex age and bmi with 30 nonvegetariansbased on the 3days food diaries the acidbase status of the food intake was estimated using the pral methodmean pral values as estimated with the standard table yielded an alkaline load of 54  144 meqd in the vegetarians compared to an acid load of 103  144 meqd in the nonvegetarians p0001mean pral values as estimated with the extended table yielded an alkaline load of 109 197 meqd in the vegetarians compared to an acid load of 138  171 meqd for the nonvegetarians p0001the findings of this study indicate that vegetarian food intake produces more alkaline outcomes compared to nonvegetarian dietsthe use of the standard pral table was sufficient for discrimination between the two diets
