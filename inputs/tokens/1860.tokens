the protective effect of vegetables on the risk of breast cancer recurrence is uncertainwe sought to evaluate the association between breast cancer recurrence and vegetable intake including analyses stratified on tamoxifen useexperimental evidence of anticarcinogenic activity of phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables in combination with tamoxifen led to specific evaluation of this class of vegetables as wellto assess the association between vegetable intake and breast cancer recurrence vegetable intake from repeat 24h dietary recalls were examined as a secondary analysis of 3080 breast cancer survivors enrolled in the womens healthy eating and living whel studyat the time of enrollment women were on average 235 months postdiagnosisthe hazard of recurrence controlling for relevant and significant clinical and demographic variables with vegetable intake was assessed overall and separately for women taking tamoxifenwhel participants reported mean baseline intakes x se of 31  005 and 05  002 servingsday of total and cruciferous vegetables respectivelybaseline vegetable intake in the highest as compared to lowest tertiles was associated with an overall lower adjusted hazard ratios hr for recurrence of 069 95 ci 055087among women taking tamoxifen the hrs were 056 95 ci 041077 for total vegetables and 065 95 ci 047089 for cruciferous vegetable intakethe hazard in women using tamoxifen who reported cruciferous vegetable intake above the median and who were within the highest tertile of total vegetable intake was hr 048 95 ci 032070this secondary analysis in over 3000 breast cancer survivors suggests that baseline vegetable intake may be associated with a reduction in the risk of breast cancer recurrent or new events particularly for those using tamoxifensuch associations should be explored further as the possibility that vegetable intake is simply a surrogate for other healthpromoting behaviors cannot be ruled out
