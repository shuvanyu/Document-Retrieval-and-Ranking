objective to examine the relation between retinal artery disease and cerebral smallvessel disease svdmethods in a prospective cohort of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease the authors performed retinal photographs and brain mritwo ophthalmologists not aware of the mr results independently assessed retinal arterial narrowing crossings sclerosis and tortuosity according to standard scoring liststwo observers independently assessed white matter lesions wml and lacunar infarcts on the mr imageslesions were considered abnormal only when both ophthalmologists or mr raters agreedcerebral svd was defined as the presence of wml or lacunar infarctsresults in 179 patients retinal photographs and brain mri were performedof the 108 patients with mr signs of svd 92 had at least one retinal vascular abnormality of the 71 patients without svd 77 had retinal pathology p  001all types of retinal vascular pathology occurred more frequently in patients with svd but only retinal arterial narrowing and sclerosis differed significantlyin the 109 normotensive patients the presence of any retinal vascular change correlated with signs of svd p  001conclusion pathologic changes in the retinal arteries parallel changes in the small cerebral arteries that cause wml and lacunes both in hypertensive and in normotensive patients
