background our goal was to forecast the global burden of alzheimers disease and evaluate the potential impact of interventions that delay disease onset or progressionmethods a stochastic multistate model was used in conjunction with united nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of alzheimers diseaseresults in 2006 the worldwide prevalence of alzheimers disease was 266 millionby 2050 the prevalence will quadruple by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the diseasewe estimate about 43 of prevalent cases need a high level of care equivalent to that of a nursing homeif interventions could delay both disease onset and progression by a modest 1 year there would be nearly 92 million fewer cases of the disease in 2050 with nearly the entire decline attributable to decreases in persons needing a high level of careconclusions we face a looming global epidemic of alzheimers disease as the worlds population agesmodest advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies that lead to even small delays in the onset and progression of alzheimers disease can significantly reduce the global burden of this disease
