objectives atherosclerosis begins in childhood and progresses during adolescence and young adulthoodthe pathobiological determinants of atherosclerosis in youth study previously reported risk scores to estimate the probability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in young individuals aged 15 to 34 years using the coronary heart disease risk factors gender age serum lipoprotein concentrations smoking hypertension obesity and hyperglycemiain this study we investigated the relation of these risk scores to the early atherosclerotic lesionsmethods we measured atherosclerotic lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery right coronary artery and abdominal aorta and the coronary heart disease risk factors in persons 15 to 34 years of age who died as a result of external causes and were autopsied in forensic laboratoriesresults risk scores computed from the modifiable risk factors were associated with prevalence of microscopically demonstrable lesions of atherosclerosis american heart association grade 1 in the left anterior descending coronary artery and with the extent of the earliest detectable gross lesion fatty streaks in the right coronary artery and abdominal aortarisk scores computed from the modifiable risk factors also were associated with prevalence of lesions of higher degrees of microscopic severity intermediate as well as advanced in the left anterior descending coronary artery and with extent of lesions of higher degrees of severity intermediate and raised lesions in the right coronary artery and abdominal aortaconclusions risk scores calculated from traditional coronary heart disease risk factors to identify individual young persons with high probability of having advanced atherosclerotic lesions also are associated with earlier atherosclerotic lesions including the earliest anatomically demonstrable atherosclerotic lesionthese results support lifestyle modification in youth to prevent development of the initial lesions and the subsequent progression to advanced lesions and thereafter to prevent or delay coronary heart disease
