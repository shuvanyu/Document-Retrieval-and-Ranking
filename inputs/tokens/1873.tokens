we assessed the relation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease to early atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and coronary arteries in 35 persons mean age at death 18 yearsaortic involvement with fatty streaks was greater in blacks than in whites 37 vs 17 percent p less than 001however aortic fatty streaks were strongly related to antemortem levels of both total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol r  067 p less than 00001 for each association independently of race sex and age and were inversely correlated with the ratio of highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol to lowdensity plus verylowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol r  035 p  006coronaryartery fatty streaks were correlated with verylowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol r  041 p  004mean systolic bloodpressure levels also tended to be higher in the four subjects with coronaryartery fibrous plaques than in those without them 112 mm hg as compared with 104 p  009these results document the importance of riskfactor levels to early anatomical changes in the aorta and coronary arteriesthe progression of fatty streaks to fibrous plaques is uncertain but these data suggest that a rational approach to the prevention of cardiovascular disease should begin early in life
