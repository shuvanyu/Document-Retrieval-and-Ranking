aging affects all organisms and its basic mechanisms are expected to be conserved across speciesoxidation of proteins has been proposed to be one of the basic mechanisms linking oxygen radicals with the basic aging processif oxidative damage to proteins is involved in aging longlived animals which age slowly should show lower levels of markers of this kind of damage than shortlived oneshowever this possibility has not been investigated yetin this study steadystate levels of markers of different kinds of protein damageoxidation glutamic and aminoadipic semialdehydes mixed glyco and lipoxidation carboxymethyl and carboxyethyllysine lipoxidation malondialdehydelysine and amino acid compositionwere measured in the heart of eight mammalian species ranging in maximum life span mlsp from 35 to 46 yearsoxidation markers were directly correlated with mlsp across speciesmixed glyco and lipoxidation markers did not correlate with mlsphowever the lipoxidation marker malondialdehydelysine was inversely correlated with mlsp r2085 p0001the amino acid compositional analysis revealed that methionine is the only amino acid strongly correlated mlsp and that such correlation is negative r2093 p0001this trait may contribute to lower steadystate levels of oxidized methionine residues in cellular proteinsthese results reinforce the notion that high longevity in homeothermic vertebrates is achieved in part by constitutively decreasing the sensitivity of both tissue proteins and lipids to oxidative damagethis is obtained by modifying the constituent structural components of proteins and lipids selecting those less sensitive to oxidative modifications
