objective early detection and early treatment are of vital importance to the successful treatment of various cancersthe development of a novel screening method that is as economical and noninvasive as the faecal occult blood test fobt for early detection of colorectal cancer crc is neededa study was undertaken using canine scent detection to determine whether odour material can become an effective tool in crc screeningdesign exhaled breath and watery stool samples were obtained from patients with crc and from healthy controls prior to colonoscopyeach test group consisted of one sample from a patient with crc and four control samples from volunteers without cancerthese five samples were randomly and separately placed into five boxesa labrador retriever specially trained in scent detection of cancer and a handler cooperated in the teststhe dog first smelled a standard breath sample from a patient with crc then smelled each sample station and sat down in front of the station in which a cancer scent was detectedresults 33 and 37 groups of breath and watery stool samples respectively were testedamong patients with crc and controls the sensitivity of canine scent detection of breath samples compared with conventional diagnosis by colonoscopy was 091 and the specificity was 099the sensitivity of canine scent detection of stool samples was 097 and the specificity was 099the accuracy of canine scent detection was high even for early cancercanine scent detection was not confounded by current smoking benign colorectal disease or inflammatory diseaseconclusions this study shows that a specific cancer scent does indeed exist and that cancerspecific chemical compounds may be circulating throughout the bodythese odour materials may become effective tools in crc screeningin the future studies designed to identify cancerspecific volatile organic compounds will be important for the development of new methods for early detection of crc
