objective to determine whether dogs can be trained to identify people with bladder cancer on the basis of urine odour more successfully than would be expected by chance alonedesign experimental proof of principle study in which six dogs were trained to discriminate between urine from patients with bladder cancer and urine from diseased and healthy controls and then evaluated in tests requiring the selection of one bladder cancer urine sample from six controlsparticipants 36 male and female patients age range 4890 years presenting with new or recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder 27 samples used for training 9 used for formal testing 108 male and female controls diseased and healthy age range 1885 years54 samples used in training 54 used for testingmain outcome measure mean proportion of successes per dog achieved during evaluation compared with an expected value of 1 in 7 14results taken as a group the dogs correctly selected urine from patients with bladder cancer on 22 out of 54 occasionsthis gave a mean success rate of 41 95 confidence intervals 23 to 58 under assumptions of normality 26 to 52 using bootstrap methods compared with 14 expected by chance alonemultivariate analysis suggested that the dogs capacity to recognise a characteristic bladder cancer odour was independent of other chemical aspects of the urine detectable by urinalysisconclusions dogs can be trained to distinguish patients with bladder cancer on the basis of urine odour more successfully than would be expected by chance alonethis suggests that tumour related volatile compounds are present in urine imparting a characteristic odour signature distinct from those associated with secondary effects of the tumour such as bleeding inflammation and infection
