conventional chemotherapies have showed their limits notably for patients with advanced cancernew therapeutic strategies must be identified and the metabolic abnormalities of cancer cells offer such opportunitiesmany human cancer cell lines and primary tumors have absolute requirements for methionine an essential amino acidin contrast normal cells are relatively resistant to exogenous methionine restrictionthe biochemical mechanism for methionine dependency has been studied extensively but the fundamental mechanism remains uncleara number of investigators have attempted to exploit the methionine dependence of tumors for therapeutic effects in vivoto reduce in vivo methionine in plasma and tumours dietary and pharmacological treatments have been usedmethioninefree diet or methioninedeprived total parenteral nutrition causes regression of a variety of animal tumoursalternatively methionine depletion was achieved by the use of methioninasethis enzyme specifically degrades methionine and inhibits tumour growth in preclinical modelsbecause of potential toxicity and quality of life problems prolonged methionine restriction with diet or with methioninase is not suitable for clinical usemethionine restriction may find greater application in association with various chemotherapeutic agentsseveral preclinical studies have demonstrated synergy between methionine restriction and various cytotoxic chemotherapy drugsthe experimental results accumulated during the last three decades suggest that methionine restriction can become an additional cancer therapeutic strategy notably in association with chemotherapy
