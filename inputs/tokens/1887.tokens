background and aims the mechanisms of cancer cell growth and metastasis are still not entirely understood especially from the viewpoint of chemical reactions in tumoursglycolytic metabolism is markedly accelerated in cancer cells causing the accumulation of glucose a reducing sugar and methionine an amino acid which can nonenzymatically react and form carcinogenic substancesthere is speculation that this reaction produces gaseous sulfurcontaining compounds in tumour tissuethe aims of this study were to clarify the products in tumour and to investigate their effect on tumour proliferationmethods products formed in the reaction between glucose and methionine or its metabolites were analysed in vitro using gas chromatographyflatus samples from patients with colon cancer and exhaled air samples from patients with lung cancer were analysed using nearedge xray fine adsorption structure spectroscopy and compared with those from healthy individualsthe tumour proliferation rates of mice into which ht29 human colon cancer cells had been implanted were compared with those of mice in which the cancer cells were surrounded by sodium hyaluronate gel to prevent diffusion of gaseous material into the healthy cellsresults gaseous sulfurcontaining compounds such as methanethiol and hydrogen sulfide were produced when glucose was allowed to react with methionine or its metabolites homocysteine or cysteinenearedge xray fine adsorption structure spectroscopy showed that the concentrations of sulfurcontaining compounds in the samples of flatus from patients with colon cancer and in the samples of exhaled air from patients with lung cancer were significantly higher than in those from healthy individualsanimal experiments showed that preventing the diffusion of sulfurcontaining compounds had a pronounced antitumour effectconclusions gaseous sulfurcontaining compounds are the main products in tumours and preventing the diffusion of these compounds reduces the tumour proliferation rate which suggests the possibility of a new approach to cancer treatment
