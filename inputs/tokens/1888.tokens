available information indicates that longlived mammals have low rates of reactive oxygen species ros generation and oxidative damage at their mitochondriaon the other hand many studies have consistently shown that dietary restriction dr in rodents also decreases mitochondrial ros mtros production and oxidative damage to mitochondrial dna and proteinsit has been observed that protein restriction also decreases mtros generation and oxidative stress in rat liver whereas neither carbohydrate nor lipid restriction change these parametersthis is interesting because protein restriction also increases maximum longevity in rodents although to a lower extent than dr and is a much more practicable intervention for humans than dr whereas neither carbohydrate nor lipid restriction seem to change rodent longevitymoreover it has been found that isocaloric methionine restriction also decreases mtros generation and oxidative stress in rodent tissues and this manipulation also increases maximum longevity in rats and micein addition excessive dietary methionine also increases mtros generation in rat liverthese studies suggest that the reduced intake of dietary methionine can be responsible for the decrease in mitochondrial ros generation and the ensuing oxidative damage that occurs during dr as well as for part of the increase in maximum longevity induced by this dietary manipulationin addition the mean intake of proteins and thus methionine of western human populations is much higher than neededtherefore decreasing such levels to the recommended ones has a great potential to lower tissue oxidative stress and to increase healthy life span in humans while avoiding the possible undesirable effects of dr diets
