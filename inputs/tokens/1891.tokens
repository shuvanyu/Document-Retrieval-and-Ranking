in the past two decades or so a number of viruses have emerged in the global swine populationsome such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 cause economically important diseases in pigs whereas others such as porcine torque teno virus ttv now known as torque teno sus virus ttsuv porcine bocavirus pbov and related novel parvoviruses porcine kobuvirus porcine toroviruses ptov and porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses plhv are mostly subclinical in swine herdsalthough some emerging swine viruses such as swine hepatitis e virus swine hev porcine endogenous retrovirus perv and porcine sapovirus porcine sav may have a limited clinical implication in swine health they do pose a potential public health concern in humans due to zoonotic swine hev or potential zoonotic porcine sav and xenozoonotic perv plhv risksother emerging viruses such as nipah virus bungowannah virus and menangle virus not only cause diseases in pigs but some also pose important zoonotic threat to humansthis article focuses on emerging and reemerging swine viruses that have a limited or uncertain clinical and economic impact on pig healththe transmission epidemiology and pathogenic potential of these viruses are discussedin addition the two economically important emerging viruses prrsv and pcv2 are also briefly discussed to identify important knowledge gaps 2012 blackwell verlag gmbh
