background and aim the occurrence of malignant pleural mesothelioma mpm has been reported among population groups with no documented professional exposure to asbestos fibres living in different geographic areasthis paper reviews existing data related to non occupational mpm including its occurrence in the province of catania sicily italymethods an electronic search of literature related to non occupational mpm was performed including the year 2005results non occupational mpm in subjects living in areas contaminated by a variety of asbestos and non asbestos fibres has been well documented through a number of epidemiologic studies including cases series casecontrol studies and a cohort studyin addition the observation of familial clustering of mpm suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of this malignancythe epidemiological evidence also suggests that mpm may occur as a result of the interaction between environmental carcinogens genetic factors and virus infectionconclusion it is likely that genetic predisposition and nonoccupational exposure to low doses of asbestos and asbestoslike fibres may concur to the development of malignant mesotheliomahowever additional epidemiological and laboratory studies are needed to further understand the relationship between environmental exposure and individual susceptibility to this malignancy
