objective workers in slaughterhouses and processing plants that handle pigs and pork butchersmeatcutters have been little studied for health risks associated with employment in spite of the fact that they are potentially exposed to oncogenic and nononcogenic transmissible agents and chemical carcinogens at workwe report here on an update of mortality in 510 workers employed in abattoirs and processing plants that almost exclusively handled pigs and pork productsmethods standardized mortality ratios smrs were estimated for the cohort as a whole and in subgroups defined by race and sex using the corresponding us general population mortality rates for comparisonstudy subjects were followed up from january 1950 to december 2006 during which time 45 of them diedresults mortality was significantly increased overall in the cohorta statistically significant excess of deaths was observed for colon and lung cancers in the entire cohort smr27 95 ci 1251 smr18 95 ci 1127 respectivelysignificant smrs in the cohort as a whole were also observed for senile and presenile psychotic conditions smr51 95 ci 14131 and pneumonia smr26 95 ci 1348an observed excess of subarachnoid hemorrhage was seen mainly in whites smr101 95 ci 12363there was a suggestion of an excess of deaths from ischemic heart disease also but the elevated smr was confined to men and was not statistically significantconclusion this study confirms the excess occurrence of lung and colon cancers and stroke previously reported in this occupational groupnew findings are the excess of risk for senile and presenile psychotic conditions and pneumonia which together with the excess of colon cancer appear specific for pigpork workers as they were not evident in much larger studies of workers in abattoirs and processing plants handling cattle and sheephowever caution should be exercised in interpreting these findings since some of them could have occurred by chance resulting from our examination of a large number of causes of death in multiple study subgroupsfor the moment the significance of these findings remains unknown until they are confirmed in larger studies of adequate statistical powerstudies that will take into account possible occupational and nonoccupational confounding factors are neededcopyright  2011published by elsevier inc
