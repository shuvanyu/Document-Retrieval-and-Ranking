objectives we studied mortality in two separate cohorts of workers in abattoirs n4996 and meat processing plants n3642 belonging to a meatcutters union because they were exposed to viruses that cause cancer in food animals and also to chemical carcinogens at workmethods standardized mortality ratios smrs and proportional mortality ratios pmrs were estimated for each cohort as a whole and in subgroups defined by race and sex using the us general population mortality rates for comparisonstudy subjects were followed up from january 1950 to december 2006 during which time over 60 of them diedresults an excess of deaths from cancers of the base of the tongue esophagus lung skin bone and bladder lymphoid leukemia and benign tumors of the thyroid and other endocrine glands and possibly hodgkins disease was observed in abattoir and meat processing workerssignificantly lower smrs were recorded for cancer of the thymus mediastinum pleura etc breast cancer and nonhodgkins lymphomaconclusion this study confirms the excess occurrence of cancer in workers in abattoirs and meat processing plants butchers and meatcutters previously reported in this cohort and other similar cohorts worldwidelarge nested casecontrol studies are now needed to examine which specific occupational and nonoccupational exposures are responsible for the excessthere is now sufficient evidence for steps to be taken to protect workers from carcinogenic exposures at the workplacethere are also serious implications for the general population which may also be exposed to some of these virusescopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
