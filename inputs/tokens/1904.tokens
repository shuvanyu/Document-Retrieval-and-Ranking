purpose to test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers and in the general population may be associated with increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers and to identify new risk factorsmethods a pilot casecohort study of both cancers within a combined cohort of 30411 highly exposed poultry workers and 16408 control subjects was conducted and risk assessed by logistic regression odds ratios or and proportional hazards risk ratiosresults new occupational findings were recorded respectively for pancreaticliver cancers for slaughtering of poultry or  89 95 confidence interval ci 27293or  91 95 ci 19429 catching of live chickens or  36 95 ci 12109or  10 95 ci 0185 killing other types of animals for food or  48 95 ci 15166or  20 95 ci 02182 and ever worked on a pig raising farm or  30 95 ci 1082 for pancreatic cancer onlynew nonoccupational findings for liver cancer were for receiving immunization with yellow fever vaccine or  87 95 ci 10763 and vaccination with typhoid vaccine or  63 95 ci 11374the study also confirmed previously reported risk factors for both diseasesconclusions this study provides preliminary evidence that exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses may possibly be associated with the occurrence of liver and pancreatic cancerscasecontrol studies nested within occupational cohorts of highly exposed subjects of sufficient statistical power may provide an efficient and valid method of investigatingconfirming these findingscopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
