twentyfour patients all of whom were exposed to aerosolized porcine brain tissue through workplace environment abattoir developed a syndrome of immunemediated polyradiculoneuropathy three also had central nervous system manifestations transverse myelitis meningoencephalitis and aseptic meningitispatients had characteristic electrophysiological findings of very distal and proximal conduction slowing prolonged distal and fwave latencies regions where the bloodnerve barrier is the most permeable and all patients serum contained a novel igg immunofluorescence patternnerve pathology when available showed mild changes of segmental demyelination axonal degeneration and inflammatory changespatients had meaningful improvement of symptoms and electrophysiologic findings with immune therapy and with removal of exposure to aerosolized brain tissuewe postulate that this outbreak is an autoimmune polyradiculoneuropathy triggered by occupational exposure to multiple aerosolized porcine neural tissue antigens that result in neural damage where the bloodnerve barrier is the least robust 2011 peripheral nerve society
