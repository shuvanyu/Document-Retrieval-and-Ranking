background in october 2007 a cluster of patients experiencing a novel polyradiculoneuropathy was identified at a pork abattoir plant apatients worked in the primary carcass processing area warm room the majority processed severed heads headtablean investigation was initiated to determine risk factors for illnessmethods and results symptoms of the reported patients were unlike previously described occupational associated illnessesa casecontrol study was conducted at plant aa case was defined as evidence of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and compatible electrodiagnostic testing in a pork abattoir workertwo control groups were used  randomly selected nonill warmroom workers n  49 and all nonill headtable workers n  56consenting cases and controls were interviewed and blood and throat swabs were collectedthe 26 largest us pork abattoirs were surveyed to identify additional casesfifteen cases were identified at plant a illness onsets occurred during may 2004november 2007median age was 32 years range 2155 yearscases were more likely than warmroom controls to have ever worked at the headtable adjusted odds ratio aor 66 95 confidence interval ci 16267 removed brains or removed muscle from the backs of heads aor 103 95 ci 15685 and worked within 010 feet of the brain removal operation aor 99 95 ci 12800associations remained when comparing headtable cases and headtable controlsworkers removed brains by using compressed air that liquefied brain and generated aerosolized droplets exposing themselves and nearby workerseight additional cases were identified in the only two other abattoirs using this techniquethe three abattoirs that used this technique have stopped brain removal and no new cases have been reported after 24 months of follow upcases compared to controls had higher median interferongamma ifnγ levels 217 pgml vs 148 pgml p0001discussion this novel polyradiculoneuropathy was associated with removing porcine brains with compressed airan autoimmune mechanism is supported by higher levels of ifnγ in cases than in controls consistent with other immune mediated illnesses occurring in association with neural tissue exposureabattoirs should not use compressed air to remove brains and should avoid procedures that aerosolize cns tissuethis outbreak highlights the potential for respiratory or mucosal exposure to cause an immunemediated illness in an occupational setting
