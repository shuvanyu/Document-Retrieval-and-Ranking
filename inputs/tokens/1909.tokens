objectives reticuloendotheliosis viruses rev are a group of retroviruses like avian leukosissarcoma viruses alsv that naturally infect and cause cancers in chickenswe recently found that alsv antibody levels were associated with job tasks in the poultry industrythe objectives of this study are to examine whether a similar association can be found with rev antibody levels and to examine the correlation between rev and alsv antibody levelsmethods relative risk was estimated comparing rev antibody levels of 45 poultry workers with those of 44 controlsthe expected mean antibody level was predicted for the association with employment by a generalized linear modelcorrelation coefficient was measured between alsv and rev antibody levelsresults rev antibody levels were significantly higher in poultry workers than in control subjects and were associated with gender and employment conditions especially employment durationthe relative risk was significantly higher for some job categoriesa significant correlation was observed between rev and alsv antibody levels which was strong among poultry workers but weak among the control subjectsconclusion antibody levels can be validly used to identify certain job tasks associated with high risk of exposure to rev in the workplace and the practical implication is recommendations for protection at these job tasksimportantly in situations where there is exposure to multiple pathogens in the workplace the analysis of antibody levels of one pathogen may sufficiently represent exposure to the other correlated pathogensthis suggested exposure assessment may hold true for pathogens with a similar route of transmission
