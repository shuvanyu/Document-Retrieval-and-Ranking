background in crosssectional studies elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been associated with poor cognition and dementiastudies of newly diagnosed dementia are required in order to establish whether the elevated homocysteine levels precede the onset of dementia or result from dementiarelated nutritional and vitamin deficienciesmethods a total of 1092 subjects without dementia 667 women and 425 men mean age 76 years from the framingham study constituted our study samplewe examined the relation of the plasma total homocysteine level measured at base line and that measured eight years earlier to the risk of newly diagnosed dementia on followupwe used multivariable proportionalhazards regression to adjust for age sex apolipoprotein e genotype vascular risk factors other than homocysteine and plasma levels of folate and vitamins b12 and b6results over a median followup period of eight years dementia developed in 111 subjects including 83 given a diagnosis of alzheimers diseasethe multivariableadjusted relative risk of dementia was 14 95 percent confidence interval 11 to 19 for each increase of 1 sd in the logtransformed homocysteine value either at base line or eight years earlierthe relative risk of alzheimers disease was 18 95 percent confidence interval 13 to 25 per increase of 1 sd at base line and 16 95 percent confidence interval 12 to 21 per increase of 1 sd eight years before base linewith a plasma homocysteine level greater than 14 micromol per liter the risk of alzheimers disease nearly doubledconclusions an increased plasma homocysteine level is a strong independent risk factor for the development of dementia and alzheimers disease
