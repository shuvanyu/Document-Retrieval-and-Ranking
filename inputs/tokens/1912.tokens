normotensive adults on lowsodium weightloss and control diets recorded preferences and perceived saltiness for sodium chloride nacl added to cream soup at intervals over 1 yrreduction in sodium intake and excretion accompanied a shift in preference toward less salt preferred concentrations by ad libitum salting declined from 072 at the onset to 033 nacl at week 24 hedonic scores for high concentrations of nacl decreased significantly while scores for low concentrations increasedafter 3 mo of sodium restriction nacl preferences readjusted to a lower level ad libitum additions of nacl were similar after 13 24 and 52 wkless hedonic variation was observed among controls than among narestricted groupsthe weightloss group showed increased liking for midrange nacl levelsmechanisms underlying preference changes including physiological behavioral and context effects may provide insights into maintenance of lowsodium diets for treatment and prevention of hypertension
