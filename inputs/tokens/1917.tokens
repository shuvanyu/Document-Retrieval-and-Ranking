objective to evaluate the effects of a highfat and lowfat diet on taste sensitivity to oleic acid c181 in lean and overweightobese owob subjectsdesign randomized crossover dietary intervention involving the consumption of a highfat 45 fat and lowfat 20 fat diet both consumed over a 4week periodsubjects a total of 19 lean mean age 3313 years mean body mass index bmi 23222 kg m2 and 12 owob mean age 3953 years mean bmi 2826 kg m2 subjects participated in the study which measured taste thresholds for c181 fat perception and hedonic ratings for regular rf and loweredfat lf foods before and following consumption of a high and lowfat dietresults consumption of the lowfat diet increased taste sensitivity to c181 among lean and owob subjects p005 and increased the subjects ability to perceive small differences in the fat content of custard p005consumption of the highfat diet significantly decreased taste sensitivity to c181 among lean subjects p005 with no change in sensitivity among owob persons p0609the hedonic ratings for several rf and lf foods differed following the dietsconclusion alterations in the fat content of the diet modulated taste sensitivity to c181 among lean subjects which was increased following a 4week period of fat restriction and attenuated following the highfat dietthe failure of the highfat diet to alter fatty acid taste thresholds among owob subjects suggests that these individuals were adapted to highfat exposure perhaps because of differences in habitual fat consumptiontaken together these data suggest that excessive dietary fat attenuates nutrient sensing epithelia response in the oral cavity which could be associated with changes in diet and weight status
