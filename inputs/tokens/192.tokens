elevated plasma homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and thrombosis as well as a variety of other pathologies such as birth defects alzheimers disease and other dementias osteoporosis diabetes and renal diseasehomocysteine metabolism is catalyzed by a number of enzymes that require bvitamins as cofactors and homocysteine levels are particularly responsive to folate statusthe predictive power of plasma homocysteine level as a risk factor for atherothrombotic orders raised the appealing hypothesis that reduction of homocysteine levels by vitamin supplementation might result in a commensurate reduction is the risk of atherothrombotic eventsunfortunately most clinical trials failed to show a significant benefit of vitamin supplementation on cardiovascular events in spite of significant lowering of plasma homocysteine levelsthus it is not clear whether homocysteine actually plays a causal role in many pathologies with which it is associated or whether it is instead a marker for some other underlying mechanisma large body of data links hyperhomocysteinemia and folate status with oxidant stressin this article i review data that suggests that homocysteine not only promotes cellular and protein injury via oxidant mechanisms but is also a marker for the presence of pathological oxidant stressthus it is possible that hyperhomocysteinemia is not a common primary cause of atherothrombotic disorders in the general population but rather a marker of systemic or endothelial oxidant stress that is a major mediator of these disorderspublished by elsevier ltd
