background the overconsumption of energydense foods leads to excessive energy intakesthe substitution of lowenergydense vegetables for foods higher in energy density can help decrease energy intakes but may be difficult to implement if individuals dislike the taste of vegetablesobjective we investigated whether incorporating puréed vegetables to decrease the energy density of entrées at multiple meals reduced daily energy intakes and increased daily vegetable intakesdesign in this crossover study 20 men and 21 women ate ad libitum breakfast lunch and dinner in the laboratory once a week for 3 wkacross conditions entrées at meals varied in energy density from standard versions 100 condition to reduced versions 85 and 75 conditions by the covert incorporation of 3 or 45 times the amount of puréed vegetablesentrées were accompanied by unmanipulated side dishesparticipants rated their hunger and fullness before and after mealsresults subjects consumed a consistent weight of foods across conditions of energy density thus the daily energy intake significantly decreased by 202  60 kcal in the 85 condition p  0001 and by 357  47 kcal in the 75 condition p  00001daily vegetable consumption significantly increased from 270  17 g of vegetables in the 100 condition to 487  25 g of vegetables in the 75 condition p  00001despite the decreased energy intake ratings of hunger and fullness did not significantly differ across conditionsentrées were rated as similar in palatability across conditionsconclusions large amounts of puréed vegetables can be incorporated into various foods to decrease the energy densitythis strategy can lead to substantial reductions in energy intakes and increases in vegetable intakesthis trial was registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct01165086
