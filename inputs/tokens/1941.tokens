few studies have examined multiple risk factors for mortality or formally compared their associations across specific causes of deaththe authors used competing risks survival analysis to evaluate associations of lifestyle and dietary factors with allcause and causespecific mortality among 50112 participants in the nurses health studythere were 4893 deaths between 1986 and 2004 1026 from cardiovascular disease 931 from smokingrelated cancers 1430 from cancers not related to smoking and 1506 from all other causesage body mass index at age 18 years weight change height current smoking and packyears of smoking glycemic load cholesterol intake systolic blood pressure and use of blood pressure medications diabetes parental myocardial infarction before age 60 years and time since menopause were directly related to allcause mortality whereas there were inverse associations for physical activity and intakes of nuts polyunsaturated fat and cereal fibermoderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased mortalitya model that incorporated differences in the associations of some risk factors with specific causes of death had a significantly better fit compared with a model in which all risk factors had common associations across all causesin the future this new model may be used to identify individuals at increased risk of mortality
