objective to assess the association between erectile dysfunction ed and the longterm risk of coronary artery disease cad and the role of age as a modifier of this associationparticipants and methods from january 1 1996 to december 31 2005 we biennially screened a random sample of 1402 communitydwelling men with regular sexual partners and without known cad for the presence of edincidence densities of cad were calculated after age stratification and adjusted for potential confounders by timedependent cox proportional hazards modelsresults the prevalence of ed was 2 for men aged 40 to 49 years 6 for men aged 50 to 59 years 17 for men aged 60 to 69 years and 39 for men aged 70 years or olderthe cad incidence densities per 1000 personyears for men without ed in each age group were 094 4049 years 509 5059 years 1072 6069 years and 2330 70 yearsfor men with ed the incidence densities of cad for each age group were 4852 4049 years 2715 5059 years 2397 6069 years and 2963 70 yearsconclusion ed and cad may be differing manifestations of a common underlying vascular pathologywhen ed occurs in a younger man it is associated with a marked increase in the risk of future cardiac events whereas in older men ed appears to be of little prognostic importanceyoung men with ed may be ideal candidates for cardiovascular risk factor screening and medical intervention
