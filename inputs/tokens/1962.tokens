objectives our goal was to evaluate the association between erectile dysfunction ed and risk of cardiovascular disease cvd and allcause mortality by conducting a metaanalysis of prospective cohort studiesbackground observational studies suggest an association between ed and the incidence of cvdhowever whether ed is an independent risk factor of cvd remains controversialmethods the pubmed database was searched through january 2011 to identify studies that met prestated inclusion criteriareference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewedtwo authors independently extracted information on the designs of the studies the characteristics of the study participants exposure and outcome assessments and control for potential confounding factorseither a fixed or a randomeffects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimatesresults twelve prospective cohort studies involving 36744 participants were included in the metaanalysisthe overall combined relative risks for men with ed compared with the reference group were 148 95 confidence interval ci 125 to 174 for cvd 146 95 ci 131 to 163 for coronary heart disease 135 95 ci 119 to 154 for stroke and 119 95 ci 105 to 134 for allcause mortalitysensitivity analysis restricted to studies with control for conventional cardiovascular risk factors yielded similar resultsno evidence of publication bias was observedconclusions this metaanalysis of prospective cohort studies suggests that ed significantly increases the risk of cvd coronary heart disease stroke and allcause mortality and the increase is probably independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factorscopyright  2011 american college of cardiology foundationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
