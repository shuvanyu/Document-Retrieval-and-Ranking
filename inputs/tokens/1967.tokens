erectile dysfunction ed is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection satisfactory for sexual performanceevidence is accumulating to consider ed as a vascular disordercommon risk factors for atherosclerosis are frequently found in association with ed and ed is frequently reported in vascular syndromes such as coronary artery disease cad hypertension cerebrovascular disease peripheral arterial disease and diabetes mellitusfinally similar early impairment of endotheliumdependent vasodilatation and late obstructive vascular changes has been reported in both ed and other vascular syndromesrecently we proposed a pathophysiologic mechanism to explain the link between ed and cad called the artery size hypothesisgiven the systemic nature of atherosclerosis all major vascular beds should be affected to the same extenthowever symptoms rarely become evident at the same timethis difference in rate of occurrence of different symptoms is proposed to be caused by the different size of the arteries supplying different vascular beds that allow a larger vessel to better tolerate the same amount of plaque compared with a smaller oneaccording to this hypothesis because penile arteries are smaller in diameter than coronary arteries patients with ed will seldom have concomitant symptoms of cad whereas patients with cad will frequently complain of edavailable clinical evidence appears to support this hypothesis
