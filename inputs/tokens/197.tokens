is it possible to prevent atrophy of key brain regions related to cognitive decline and alzheimers disease adone approach is to modify nongenetic risk factors for instance by lowering elevated plasma homocysteine using b vitaminsin an initial randomized controlled study on elderly subjects with increased dementia risk mild cognitive impairment according to 2004 petersen criteria we showed that highdose bvitamin treatment folic acid 08 mg vitamin b6 20 mg vitamin b12 05 mg slowed shrinkage of the whole brain volume over 2 yhere we go further by demonstrating that bvitamin treatment reduces by as much as seven fold the cerebral atrophy in those gray matter gm regions specifically vulnerable to the ad process including the medial temporal lobein the placebo group higher homocysteine levels at baseline are associated with faster gm atrophy but this deleterious effect is largely prevented by bvitamin treatmentwe additionally show that the beneficial effect of b vitamins is confined to participants with high homocysteine above the median 11 Âµmoll and that in these participants a causal bayesian network analysis indicates the following chain of events b vitamins lower homocysteine which directly leads to a decrease in gm atrophy thereby slowing cognitive declineour results show that bvitamin supplementation can slow the atrophy of specific brain regions that are a key component of the ad process and that are associated with cognitive declinefurther bvitamin supplementation trials focusing on elderly subjets with high homocysteine levels are warranted to see if progression to dementia can be prevented
