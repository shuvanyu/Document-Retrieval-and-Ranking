to investigate the chemopreventive effects of seaweed on breast cancer we have been studying the relationship between iodine and breast cancerwe found earlier that the seaweed wakame showed a suppressive effect on the proliferation of dmba dimethylbenzaanthraceneinduced rat mammary tumors possibly via apoptosis inductionin the present study powdered mekabu was placed in distilled water and left to stand for 24 h at 4 degrees c the filtered supernatant was used as mekabu solutionit showed an extremely strong suppressive effect on rat mammary carcinogenesis when used in daily drinking water without toxicityin vitro mekabu solution strongly induced apoptosis in 3 kinds of human breast cancer cellsthese effects were stronger than those of a chemotherapeutic agent widely used to treat human breast cancerfurthermore no apoptosis induction was observed in normal human mammary cellsin japan mekabu is widely consumed as a safe inexpensive foodour results suggest that mekabu has potential for chemoprevention of human breast cancer
