although assays for the most popular markers of exerciseinduced oxidative stress may experience methodological flaws there is sufficient credible evidence to suggest that exercise is accompanied by an increased generation of free radicals resulting in a measurable degree of oxidative modifications to various moleculeshowever the mechanisms responsible are uncleara common assumption that increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption leads per se to increased reactive oxygen species ros production is not supported by in vitro and in vivo datathe specific contributions of other systems xanthine oxidase inflammation haem protein autooxidation are poorly characterisedit has been demonstrated that ros have the capacity to contribute to the development of muscle fatigue in situ but there is still a lack of convincing direct evidence that ros impair exercise performance in vivo in humansit remains unclear whether exerciseinduced oxidative modifications have little significance induce harmful oxidative damage or are an integral part of redox regulationit is clear that ros play important roles in numerous physiological processes at rest however the detailed physiological functions of ros in exercise remain to be elucidated
