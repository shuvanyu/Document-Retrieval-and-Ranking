oxidative stress is a natural physiological process that describes an imbalance between free radical production and the ability of the antioxidant defence system of the body to neutralize free radicalsfree radicals can be beneficial as they may promote wound healing and contribute to a healthy immune responsehowever free radicals can have a detrimental impact when they interfere with the regulation of apoptosis and thus play a role in the promotion of some cancers and conditions such as cardiovascular diseaseantioxidants are molecules that reduce the damage associated with oxidative stress by counteracting free radicalsregular exercise is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle although it can increase oxidative stressas a typical vegetarian diet comprises a wide range of antioxidantrich foods it is plausible that the consumption of these foods will result in an enhanced antioxidant system capable of reducing exerciseinduced oxidative stressin addition a relationship between a vegetarian diet and lower risks of cardiovascular disease and some cancers has been establishedthis review explores the current available evidence linking exercise vegetarians antioxidants and oxidative stress
