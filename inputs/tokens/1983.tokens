to determine if 6 weeks of supplementation with antioxidants could alleviate exerciseinduced dna damage we studied 21 runners during a 50 km ultramarathonsubjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups 1 placebos pl or 2 antioxidants ao 1000 mg vitamin c and 400 iu rrralphatocopheryl acetatethe comet assay was used to assess dna damage in circulating leukocytes at selected time points pre mid and 2 h postrace and daily for 6 days postraceall subjects completed the race run time 71  01 h energy expenditure 5008  80 kcal for women n  10 and 6932  206 kcal for men n  11overall the percentage dna damage increased at midrace p 02 but returned to baseline by 2 h postrace indicating that the exercise bout induced nonpersistent dna damagethere was a gender x treatment x time interaction p 01one day postrace women taking ao had 62 less dna damage than women taking pl p 0008in contrast there were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups of men at any time pointthus endurance exercise resulted in dna damage as shown by the comet assay and ao seemed to enhance recovery in women but not in men
