exerciseinduced deoxyribonucleic acid dna damage is often associated with an increase in free radicals however there is a lack of evidence examining the two in parallelthis study tested the hypothesis that highintensity exercise has the ability to produce free radicals that may be capable of causing dna damagetwelve apparently healthy male subjects age 23  4 years stature 181  8 cm body mass 80  9 kg and vo2max  49  5 mlkgmin performed three 5 min consecutive and incremental stages 40 70 and 100 of vo2max  of aerobic exercise with a 15min period separating each stageblood was drawn after each bout of exercise for the determination of ex vivo free radicals dna damage protein carbonyls lipid hydroperoxide looh concentration and a range of lipidsoluble antioxidantslipidderived oxygencentered free radicals hyperfine coupling constants anitrogen  137 gauss g and aÎ²hydrogen  18 g increased as a result of acute moderate and highintensity exercise p  005 while dna damage was also increased p  005systemic changes were observed in looh and for lipidsoluble antioxidants throughout exercise p  005 however there was no observed change in protein carbonyl concentration p  005these findings identify lipidderived free radical species as possible contributors to peripheral mononuclear cell dna damage in the human exercising modelthis damage occurs in the presence of lipid oxidation but in the absence of any change to protein carbonyl concentrationthe significance of these findings may have relevance in terms of immune function the aging process and the pathology of carcinogenesiscopyright  2010 wileyliss inc
