pharmacological antioxidant vitamins have previously been investigated for a prophylactic effect against exerciseinduced oxidative stresshowever large doses are often required and may lead to a state of prooxidation and oxidative damagewatercress contains an array of nutritional compounds such as βcarotene and αtocopherol which may increase protection against exerciseinduced oxidative stressthe present randomised controlled investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that acute consumption 2 h before exercise and chronic 8 weeks consumption watercress supplementation can attenuate exerciseinduced oxidative stressa total of ten apparently healthy male subjects age 23 sd 4 years stature 179 sd 10 cm and body mass 74 sd 15 kg were recruited to complete the 8week chronic watercress intervention period and then 8 weeks of control with no ingestion of the experiment before crossing over in order to compete the singledose acute phase with control no ingestionblood samples were taken at baseline presupplementation at rest preexercise and following exerciseeach subject completed an incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion following chronic and acute watercress supplementation or controlthe main findings show an exerciseinduced increase in dna damage and lipid peroxidation over both acute and chronic control supplementation phases p 005 v supplementation while acute and chronic watercress attenuated dna damage and lipid peroxidation and decreased h₂o₂ accumulation following exhaustive exercise p 005 v controla marked increase in the main lipidsoluble antioxidants αtocopherol γtocopherol and xanthophyll was observed following watercress supplementation p 005 v control in both experimental phasesthese findings suggest that short and longterm watercress ingestion has potential antioxidant effects against exerciseinduced dna damage and lipid peroxidation
