reactive oxygen species produced during vigorous exercise may permeate into cell nuclei and induce oxidative dna damage but the supporting evidence is still lackingby using a 42 km marathon race as a model of massive aerobic exercise we demonstrated a significant degree of unrepaired dna base oxidation in peripheral immunocompetent cells despite a concurrent increase in the urinary excretion of 8hydroxy2deoxyguanosinesingle cell gel electrophoresis with the incorporation of lesionspecific endonucleases further revealed that oxidized pyrimidines endonuclease iiisensitive sites contributed to most of the postexercise nucleotide oxidationthe oxidative dna damage correlated significantly with plasma levels of creatinine kinase and lipid peroxidation metabolites and lasted for more than 1 week following the racethis phenomenon may be one of the mechanisms behind the immune dysfunctions after exhaustive exercise
