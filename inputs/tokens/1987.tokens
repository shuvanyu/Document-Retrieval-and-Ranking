the single cell gel electrophoresis scg assay comet assay is a sensitive technique for detecting the presence of dna strandbreaks and alkalilabile damage in individual cellsthis technique was used to study peripheral blood cells from three volunteers after physical activitythe test subjects had to run on a treadmill and were checked for blood pressure and ecg lactate concentration and creatine kinase activityblood was taken before and several times during and after the runin a first multiple step test the volunteers ran as long as possible with increasing speedin a second test they had to run for 45 min with a fixed individual speed which was defined to ensure an aerobic metabolismin the first test the white blood cells of all subjects showed increased dna migration in the scg assaythe effect was seen 6 h after the end of the exercise and reached its maximum 24 h laterafter 72 h dna migration decreased to about control levelthe distribution of dna migration among cells clearly demonstrated that the majority of white blood cells exhibited increased dna migration and that the effect was not only due to a small fraction of damaged cellsfrom the same blood samples blood cultures were set up to study a possible effect on the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges sce another indicator for genotoxic effectshowever there was no significant increase in sce in any of the culturesin the second exercise during aerobic metabolism the effect on dna migration was not seenabstract truncated at 250 words
