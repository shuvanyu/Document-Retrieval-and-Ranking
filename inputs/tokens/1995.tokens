the effects of antioxidant diet supplements on blood lactate concentration and on the aerobic and anaerobic thresholds and their adaptations to training were analysedfifteen amateur male athletes were randomly assigned to either a placebo group or an antioxidantsupplemented group 90 days supplementation with 500 mg x day1 of vitamin e and 30 mg x day1 of betacarotene and the last 15 days also with 1 g x day1 of vitamin cbefore and after the antioxidant supplements the sportsmen performed a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer and maximal and submaximal physiological parameters were assessed together with blood lactate concentrationmaximal oxygen uptake vo2max maximal blood lactate concentration and the maximal workload attained rose significantly in both groups after the 3 months of trainingat the end of the study maximal blood lactate concentration was lower in the group that took supplements than in the placebo groupthe percentage of vo2max attained at the anaerobic threshold rose significantly in both groups after 3 months of training although the final value in the supplemented group was higher than that in the placebo groupantioxidant diet supplements induced lower increases in blood lactate concentration after a maximal exercise test and could improve the efficiency in which aerobic energy is obtained
