objective this study investigated how consumption of orange juice associated with aerobic training affected serum lipids and physical characteristics of overweight middleaged womenmethods the experimental group consisted of 13 women who consumed 500 mld of orange juice and did 1h aerobic training 3 times a week for 3 monthsthe control group consisted of another 13 women who did the same aerobic training program but did not consume orange juiceresults at the end of the experiment the control group lost an average of 15 of fat mass p005 and 25 of weight p005 whereas the experimental group lost 11 of fat mass and 12 of weight p005consumption of orange juice by the experimental group was associated with increased dietary intake of vitamin c and folate by 126 and 61 respectivelyserum ldlc decreased 15 p005 and hdlc increased 18 p005 in the experimental group but no significant change was observed in the control groupboth groups improved the anaerobic threshold by 20 p005 but blood lactate concentration decreased 27 in the experimental group compared to the 17 control group suggesting that experimental group has less muscle fatigue and better response to trainingconclusions the consumption of 500 mld of orange juice associated with aerobic training in overweight women decreased cardiovascular disease risk by reducing ldlc levels and increasing hdlc levelsthis association also decreased blood lactate concentration and increased anaerobic threshold showing some improvement in the physical performancecopyright  2010 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
