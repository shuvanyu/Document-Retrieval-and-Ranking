background preclinical studies have shown that statins particularly simvastatin can prevent growth in breast cancer cell lines and animal modelswe investigated whether statins used after breast cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of breast cancerspecific or allcause mortality in a large cohort of breast cancer patientsmethods a cohort of 17880 breast cancer patients newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009 was identified from english cancer registries from the national cancer data repositorythis cohort was linked to the uk clinical practice research datalink providing prescription records and to the office of national statistics mortality data up to 2013 identifying 3694 deaths including 1469 deaths attributable to breast cancerunadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios hrs for breast cancerspecific and allcause mortality in statin users after breast cancer diagnosis were calculated using timedependent cox regression modelssensitivity analyses were conducted using multiple imputation methods propensity score methods and a casecontrol approachresults there was some evidence that statin use after a diagnosis of breast cancer had reduced mortality due to breast cancer and all causes fully adjusted hr  084 95 confidence interval  068104 and 084 072097 respectivelythese associations were more marked for simvastatin 079 063100 and 081 070095 respectivelyconclusions in this large populationbased breast cancer cohort there was some evidence of reduced mortality in statin users after breast cancer diagnosishowever these associations were weak in magnitude and were attenuated in some sensitivity analyses
