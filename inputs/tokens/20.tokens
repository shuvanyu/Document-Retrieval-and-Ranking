the subchronic effect of hibiscus sabdariffa hs calyx aqueous extract on the rat testes was investigated with a view to evaluate the pharmacological basis for the use of hs calyx extract as an aphrodisiacthree test groups received different doses of 115 230 and 460 gkg based on the ld50the extracts were dissolved in the drinking waterthe control group was given equivalent volume of water onlythe animals were allowed free access to drinking solution during the 12week period of exposureat the expiration of the treatment period animals were sacrificed testes excised and weighed and epididymal sperm number recordedthe testes were processed for histological examinationresults did not show any significant p005 change in the absolute and relative testicular weightsthere was however a significant p005 decrease in the epididymal sperm counts in the 46 gkg group compared to the controlthe 115 gkg dose group showed distortion of tubules and a disruption of normal epithelial organization while the 23 gkg dose showed hyperplasia of testis with thickening of the basement membranethe 46 gkg dose group on the other hand showed disintegration of sperm cellsthe results indicate that aqueous hs calyx extract induces testicular toxicity in rats
