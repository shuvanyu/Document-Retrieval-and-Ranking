fruit and vegetable consumption reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease developmentthe postprandial state is an important contributor to chronic disease developmentorange flavonoids may reduce postprandial oxidationit was hypothesized that a mixture of orange flavonoids would reduce postprandial oxidation better than a single orange flavonoid or orange sugar and ascorbic acid but not as well as orange juice when consumed with a typical breakfasta placebocontrolled crossover trial 16 male and female participants 4 treatments 4 visits was carried outtreatments were placebo ascorbic acid and sugar equivalent to orange juice placebo plus hesperidin placebo plus hesperidin luteolin and naringenin mixture found to have synergistic antioxidant properties in vitro in previous work and orange juice positive controlserum oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac total plasma phenolics tp and serum lipoprotein oxidation lo were measured after a 12hour baseline fast and at 1 2 and 3 hours after sample consumptionthe placebo plus mixture and orange juice groups were significantly increased in orac and lo lag timedata for tp were inconsistent with orac and locontrary to previous studies attributing the protective postprandial effect to fructose and ascorbate in other fruit trials orange phenolic compounds contribute directly to the postprandial oxidative protection of serum despite an inconsistent change in serum tpcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
