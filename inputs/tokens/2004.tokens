hesperetin is an aglycone of citrus flavonoids and is expected to exert a vasodilatation effect in vivowe developed waterdispersible hesperetin by the process of micronization to enhance the bioavailability of hesperetinthis study aimed to assess the effect of this process on the bioavailability of hesperetin and to estimate its efficiency on vasodilatationrelated functions using endothelial cells in vitro and a human volunteer study at a single dose in vivowe found that waterdispersible hesperetin was absorbed rapidly with its maximum plasma concentration cmax being 102  12 μm and that the time to reach cmax which is within 1 h if 150 mg of this preparation was orally administered in humanslcms analyses of the plasma at cmax demonstrated that hesperetin accumulated in the plasma as hesperetin 7oβdglucuronide hp7ga hesperetin 3oβdglucuronide hp3ga and hesperetin sulfate exclusivelysimilar to hesperetin hp7ga enhanced nitric oxide no release by inhibiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphateoxidase nadph oxidase activity in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell culture system indicating that plasma hesperetin metabolites can improve vasodilatation in the vascular systema volunteer study using women with cold sensitivity showed that a single dose of waterdispersible hesperetin was effective on peripheral vasodilatationthese results strongly suggest that rapid accumulation with higher plasma concentration enables hesperetin to exert a potential vasodilatation effect by the endothelial action of its plasma metaboliteswaterdispersible hesperetin may be useful to improve the health effect of dietary hesperetinthis journal is  the royal society of chemistry 2012
