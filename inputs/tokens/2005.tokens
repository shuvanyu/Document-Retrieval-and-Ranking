studies on the association between plant foods and cerebrovascular diseases have given contradictory results suggesting the existence of some effectmodifying factorsthe present study determines whether the consumption of plant foods iefruits and berries vegetables and cereals predicts a decreased cerebrovascular disease incidence in a population with low fruit and vegetable and high wholegrain intakethis cohort study on 3932 men and women was based on data from the finnish mobile clinic health examination survey conducted in 196872the participants were 4074 years of age and free of cardiovascular diseases at baselinedata on the plant food consumption were derived from a 1year dietary history interviewduring a 24year followup 625 cases of cerebrovascular diseases occurred leading to either hospitalisation or deathan inverse association was found between fruit consumption and the incidence of cerebrovascular diseases ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhagethe adjusted relative risks rr between the highest and lowest quartiles of intake of any cerebrovascular disease ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage were 075 95  ci 059 094 073 95  ci 054 100 and 047 95  ci 024 092 respectivelythese associations were primarily due to the consumption of citrus fruits and occurred only in mentotal consumption of vegetables or cereals was not associated with the cerebrovascular disease incidencethe consumption of cruciferous vegetables however predicted a reduced risk of cerebrovascular diseases rr 079 95  ci 063 099 ischaemic stroke rr 067 95  ci 049 092 and intracerebral haemorrhage rr 049 95  ci 025 098in conclusion the consumption of fruits especially citrus and cruciferous vegetables may protect against cerebrovascular diseases
