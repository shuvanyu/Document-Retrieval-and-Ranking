background we previously showed in healthy middleaged moderately overweight men that orange juice decreases diastolic blood pressure and significantly improves postprandial microvascular endothelial reactivity and that hesperidin could be causally linked to the observed beneficial effect of orange juicethe objective was to determine the effect of chronic consumption of orange juice on the gene expression profile of leukocytes in healthy volunteers and to assess to what extent hesperidin is involved in the effect of orange juicemethodologyprincipal findings volunteers were included in a randomized controlled crossover studythroughout three 4week periods volunteers consumed daily 500 ml orange juice 500 ml control drink plus hesperidin or 500 ml control drink and placeboblood samplings were performed on 10 overnightfasted subjects after the 4week treatment periodglobal gene expression profiles were determined using human whole genome cdna microarraysboth orange juice and hesperidin consumption significantly affected leukocyte gene expressionorange juice consumption induced changes in expression of 3422 genes while hesperidin intake modulated the expression of 1819 genesbetween the orange juice and hesperidin consumption groups 1582 regulated genes were in commonmany of these genes are implicated in chemotaxis adhesion infiltration and lipid transport which is suggestive of lower recruitment and infiltration of circulating cells to vascular wall and lower lipid accumulationconclusions this study shows that regular consumption of orange juice for 4 weeks alters leukocyte gene expression to an antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic profile and hesperidin displays a relevant role in the genomic effect of this beveragetrial registration clinicaltrialsgov nct 00983086
