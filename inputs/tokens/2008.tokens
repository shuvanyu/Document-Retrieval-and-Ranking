recent attention has been given to the influence of dietary factors on health and mental wellbeingoxidative stress is associated with many diseases including neurodegenerative disordersdietary flavonoids exert cardioprotective chemopreventive and neuroprotective effectsthe biological activities of flavonoids have been attributed to their antioxidant antiinflammatory and signaling propertiesa clear understanding of the mechanisms of action as either antioxidants or signaling molecules is crucial for the application of flavonoids as interventions in neurodegeneration and as brain foodscitrus flavonoids exert little adverse effect and have low or no cytotoxicity to healthy normal cellsthe main citrus flavonoids can also traverse the bloodbrain barrier hence they are promising candidates for intervention in neurodegeneration and as constituents in brain foodsin this review we discuss the bioactivity multiple neuroprotection mechanisms and antioxidant and signaling properties of citrus flavonoidsreceptormediated neuroprotective actions and parallel signaling pathways are also exploredfinally the induction of cellular defense proteins against oxidative stress and neurotoxicity by hesperetin a main and widespread citrus flavonoid are also discussedit is suggested that citrus fruits which are rich in abundant sources of hesperetin and other flavonoids are promising for the development of general foodbased neuroprotection and brain foods
