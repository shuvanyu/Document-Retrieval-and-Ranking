background individuals consuming diets dense in fruits and vegetables consume an array of phytonutrients as well as recognized nutritional components including vitamins minerals and fiberthere is a growing body of evidence that phytonutrients may play positive roles in healthobjective the purpose of this research was to estimate usual intakes of nine individual phytonutrients by americans consuming recommended levels of fruits and vegetables compared to intakes by adults not meeting these recommendations and to identify contributions of food sources to total phytonutrient intakesthe phytonutrients examined in this study are found predominantly in fruits and vegetablesdesign food consumption data from the national health and nutrition examination surveys 20032006 and phytonutrient concentration data from us department of agriculture databases and the published literature were used to estimate energyadjusted usual intakesstudents t tests were used to compare mean energyadjusted phytonutrient intakes between subpopulations who consumed recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables vs those who did notpercentage contributions of each phytonutrient by food source were estimated for all adultsresults energyadjusted intakes of all phytonutrients other than ellagic acid were considerably higher among both men and women meeting dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetable intakes compared to those not meeting the recommendations energyadjusted intakes of ellagic acid were higher only among women meeting vs not meeting the recommendationsfor five of the nine phytonutrients αcarotene βcryptoxanthin lycopene hesperetin and ellagic acid a single food accounted for 64 or more of the total intake of the phytonutrientconclusions energyadjusted intakes of carotenoids and flavonoids are higher among men and women whose diets conform to dietary guidance for fruits and vegetablesa limited number of foods provide the majority of these phytonutrientsfindings from this research provide important reference information on the phytonutrient contributions of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables
