the commonly used food additive carrageenan including lambda λ kappa κ and iota ι forms is composed of galactose disaccharides linked in alpha13 and beta14 glycosidic bonds with up to three sulfate groups per disaccharide residuecarrageenan closely resembles the endogenous galactose or nacetylgalactosaminecontaining glycosaminoglycans gags chondroitin sulfate cs dermatan sulfate ds and keratan sulfatehowever these gags have beta13 and beta14 glycosidic bonds in contrast to the unusual alpha13 glycosidic bond in carrageenansince sulfatase activity is inhibited by sulfate and carrageenan is so highly sulfated we tested the effect of carrageenan exposure on sulfatase activity in human intestinal and mammary epithelial cell lines and found that carrageenan exposure significantly reduced the activity of sulfatases including nacetylgalactosamine4sulfatase galactose6sulfatase iduronate sulfatase steroid sulfatase arylsulfatase a sulf12 and heparan sulfamidaseconsistent with the inhibition of sulfatase activity following exposure to carrageenan gag content increased significantly and showed marked differences in disaccharide compositionspecific changes in cs disaccharides included increases in disulfated disaccharide components of csd 2s6s and cse 4s6s with declines in csa 4s and csc 6sspecific changes in heparinheparan sulfate disaccharides included increases in 6s disaccharides as well as increases in ns and 2s6s disaccharidesstudy results suggest that carrageenan inhibition of sulfatase activity leads to redistribution of the cellular gag composition with increase in disulfated cs and with potential consequences for cell structure and function
