the widely used food additive carrageenan cgn has been shown to induce intestinal inflammation ulcerative colitislike symptoms or neoplasm in the gut epithelia in animal models which are also clinical features of human inflammatory bowel diseasein this study the effects of cgn on proinflammatory transcription factors nfκb and early growth response gene 1 product egr1 were evaluated in terms of human intestinal epithelial barrier integrityboth proinflammatory transcription factors were elevated by cgn and only nfκb activation was shown to be involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin8moreover the integrity of the in vitro epithelial monolayer under the cgn insult was maintained by both activated proinflammatory transcription factors nfκb and egr1suppression of nfκb or egr1 aggravated barrier disruption by cgn which was associated with the reduced gene expression of tight junction component zonula occludens 1 and its irregular localization in the epithelial monolayercopyright  2012 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
