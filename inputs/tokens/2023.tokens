acrylamide is a heatinduced carcinogen compound that is found in some foods consequently to cooking or other thermal processesin the second french total diet study tds acrylamide was analysed in 192 food samples collected in mainland france to be representative of the population diet and prepared as consumedhighest mean concentrations were found in potato chipscrisps 954 μgkg french fries and other fried potatoes 724 μgkg and salted biscuits other than potato chips 697 μgkgexposure of general adult and child populations was assessed by combining analytical results with national consumption datamean acrylamide exposure was assessed to be 043033 μgkg of body weight bw per day for adults and 069058 μgkg bwday for childrenalthough the exposure assessed is lower than in previous evaluations the calculated margins of exposure based on benchmark dose limits defined for carcinogenic effects remain very low especially for young children below 100 at the 95th percentile of exposure indicating a health concernit is therefore advisable to continue efforts in order to reduce dietary exposure to acrylamidecopyright â 2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
