multiple studies in animal models have shown that the commonly used food additive carrageenan cgn induces inflammation and intestinal neoplasiawe performed the first studies to determine the effects of cgn exposure on human intestinal epithelial cells iec in tissue culture and tested the effect of very low concentrations 110 mgl of undegraded highmolecular weight cgnthese concentrations of cgn are less than the anticipated exposure of the human colon to cgn from the average western dietin the human colonic epithelial cell line ncm460 and in primary human colonic epithelial cells that were exposed to cgn for 18 d we found increased cell death reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest compared with unexposed control cellsafter 68 d of cgn exposure the percentage of cells reentering g0g1 significantly decreased and the percentages of cells in s and g2m phases significantly increasedincreases in activated p53 p21 and p15 followed cgn exposure consistent with cgninduced cell cycle arrestadditional data including dna ladder poly adp ribose polymerase western blot nuclear dna staining and activities of caspases 3 and 7 indicated no evidence of increased apoptosis following cgn exposure and were consistent with cgninduced necrotic cell deaththese data document for the first time to our knowledge marked adverse effects of low concentrations of cgn on survival of normal human iec and suggest that cgn exposure may have a role in development of human intestinal pathology
