in this article i review the association between exposure to carrageenan and the occurrence of colonic ulcerations and gastrointestinal neoplasms in animal modelsalthough the international agency for research on cancer in 1982 identified sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of degraded carrageenan in animals to regard it as posing a carcinogenic risk to humans carrageenan is still used widely as a thickener stabilizer and texturizer in a variety of processed foods prevalent in the western dieti reviewed experimental data pertaining to carrageenans effects with particular attention to the occurrence of ulcerations and neoplasms in association with exposure to carrageenanin addition i reviewed from established sources mechanisms for production of degraded carrageenan from undegraded or native carrageenan and data with regard to carrageenan intakereview of these data demonstrated that exposure to undegraded as well as to degraded carrageenan was associated with the occurrence of intestinal ulcerations and neoplasmsthis association may be attributed to contamination of undegraded carrageenan by components of low molecular weight spontaneous metabolism of undegraded carrageenan by acid hydrolysis under conditions of normal digestion or the interactions with intestinal bacteriaalthough in 1972 the us food and drug administration considered restricting dietary carrageenan to an average molecular weight  100000 this resolution did not prevail and no subsequent regulation has restricted usebecause of the acknowledged carcinogenic properties of degraded carrageenan in animal models and the cancerpromoting effects of undegraded carrageenan in experimental models the widespread use of carrageenan in the western diet should be reconsidered
