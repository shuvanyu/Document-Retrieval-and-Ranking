prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes may disrupt thyroid function and contribute to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomeswe conducted a pilot study to explore the relationship between serum concentrations of lowerbrominated pbdes bde17 to 154 higherbrominated pbdes bde183 to 209 and hydroxylated pbde metabolites ohpbdes with measures of thyroid function in pregnant womenconcentrations of pbdes ohpbdes thyroidstimulating hormone tsh total thyroxine t4 and free t4 were measured in serum samples collected between 2008 and 2009 from 25 second trimester pregnant women in californiamedian concentrations of lowerbrominated pbdes and ohpbdes were the highest reported to date in pregnant womenmedian concentrations of bde47 and the sum of lowerbrominated pbdes σpbde5 were 431 ngg lipid and 858 ngg lipid and 0084 ngml for the sum of ohpbdes σohpbde4we observed a positive association between the weighted sum of chemicals known to bind to transthyretin σttr binders and tsh levelswe also found positive associations between tsh and σpbde5 σohpbde4 bde47 bde85 5ohbde47 and 4ohbde49 and an inverse association with bde207relationships with free and total t4 were weak and inconsistentour results indicate that pbde exposures are elevated in pregnant women in california and suggest a relationship with thyroid functionfurther investigation is warranted to characterize the risks of pbde exposures during pregnancy
