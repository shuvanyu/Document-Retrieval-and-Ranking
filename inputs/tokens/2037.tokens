background functional abdominal pain syndrome faps has chronic unexplained abdominal pain and is similar to the psychiatric diagnosis of somatoform pain disordera patient with irritable bowel syndrome ibs also has chronic unexplained abdominal pain and rectal hypersensitivity is observed in a majority of the patientshowever no reports have evaluated the visceral sensory function of faps preciselywe aimed to test the hypothesis that faps would show altered visceral sensation compared to healthy controls or ibsthe present study determined the rectal perceptual threshold intensity of sensation using visual analogue scale vas and rectal compliance in response to rectal balloon distention by a barostat in faps ibs and healthy controlsmethods first the ramp distention of 40 mlmin was induced and the thresholds of discomfort pain and maximum tolerance mmhg were measurednext three phasic distentions 60sec duration separated by 30sec intervals of 10 15 and 20 mmhg were randomly loadedthe subjects were asked to mark the vas in reference to subjective intensity of sensation immediately after each distentiona pressurevolume relationship was determined by plotting corresponding pressures and volumes during ramp distention and the compliance was calculated over the linear part of the curve by calculating from the slope of the curve using simple regressionresults rectal thresholds were significantly reduced in ibs but not in fapsthe vas ratings of intensity induced by phasic distention around the discomfort threshold of the controls were increased in ibs but significantly decreased in fapsrectal compliance was reduced in ibs but not in fapsconclusion an inconsistency of visceral sensitivity between lower and higher pressure distention might be a key feature for understanding the pathogenesis of faps
