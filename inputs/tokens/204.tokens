background california childrens exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants pbdes are among the highest worldwidepbdes are known endocrine disruptors and neurotoxicants in animalsobjective here we investigate the relation of in utero and child pbde exposure to neurobehavioral development among participants in chamacos center for the health assessment of mothers and children of salinas a california birth cohortmethods we measured pbdes in maternal prenatal and child serum samples and examined the association of pbde concentrations with childrens attention motor functioning and cognition at 5 n  310 and 7 years of age n  323results maternal prenatal pbde concentrations were associated with impaired attention as measured by a continuous performance task at 5 years and maternal report at 5 and 7 years of age with poorer fine motor coordinationparticularly in the nondominantat both age points and with decrements in verbal and fullscale iq at 7 yearspbde concentrations in children 7 years of age were significantly or marginally associated with concurrent teacher reports of attention problems and decrements in processing speed perceptual reasoning verbal comprehension and fullscale iqthese associations were not altered by adjustment for birth weight gestational age or maternal thyroid hormone levelsconclusions both prenatal and childhood pbde exposures were associated with poorer attention fine motor coordination and cognition in the chamacos cohort of schoolage childrenthis study the largest to date contributes to growing evidence suggesting that pbdes have adverse impacts on child neurobehavioral development
