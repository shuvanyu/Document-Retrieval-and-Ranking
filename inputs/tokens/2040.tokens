1topical application of capsaicin to the human nasal mucosa induced a burning sensation and sneezinga dosedependent seromucous nasal secretion was also observedcapsaicin 75 micrograms was more potent than methacholine 50 mg in producing nasal secretion while topical histamine 200 micrograms substance p 135 micrograms and calcitonin generelated peptide 36 micrograms did not induce rhinorrhea2pretreatment with either topical ipratropium bromide systemic dexchlorpheniramine or indomethacin did not influence the effects induced by capsaicintopical pretreatment with lidocaine inhibited the painful sensation but failed to block the rhinorrheadesensitization to the effects of capsaicin occurred following 45 subsequent applications and full recovery was observed within 3040 days3it is proposed that the effects of capsaicin in human nasal mucosa are due to excitation of primary afferent neurones that a convey burning and painful sensation b evoke a sneezing reflex and c induce nasal secretion by releasing transmitters from their peripheral terminals
