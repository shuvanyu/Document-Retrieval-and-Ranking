preliminary studies have shown that repeated nasal applications of capsaicin prevented the occurrence of cluster headache attacksthe present study was designed to verify the difference in efficacy of treatment with nasal capsaicin depending on the side of applicationfiftytwo patients affected by episodic form were divided into 2 groups one receiving the treatment on the same side where the attacks occurred ipsilateral side the other on the controlateral sideeighteen patients with a chronic form alternately received both ipsilateral and controlateral treatmentsseventy percent of the episodic patients treated on the ipsilateral side showed a marked amelioration whereas no improvement was noted in the patients treated on the contralateral sidethe efficacy of ipsilateral treatment was emphasized by the results obtained in chronic patientshowever in these patients the maximum period of amelioration lasted no more than 40 daysthe difference between the effects of the 2 treatments contralateral and ipsilateral was statistically significant in both episodic and chronic sufferersthe efficacy of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin in cluster headache is congruent with previous reports on the therapeutic effect of capsaicin in other pain syndromes postherpetic neuralgia diabetic neuropathy trigeminal neuralgia and supports the use of the drug to produce a selective analgesia
