background tart montmorency cherries have been reported to contain high levels of phytochemicals including melatonin a molecule critical in regulating the sleepwake cycle in humanspurpose the aim of our investigation was to ascertain whether ingestion of a tart cherry juice concentrate would increase the urinary melatonin levels in healthy adults and improve sleep qualitymethods in a randomised doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover design 20 volunteers consumed either a placebo or tart cherry juice concentrate for 7 daysmeasures of sleep quality recorded by actigraphy and subjective sleep questionnaires were completedsequential urine samples over 48 h were collected and urinary 6sulfatoxymelatonin major metabolite of melatonin determined cosinor analysis was used to determine melatonin circadian rhythm mesor acrophase and amplitudein addition total urinary melatonin content was determined over the sampled periodtrial differences were determined using a repeated measures anovaresults total melatonin content was significantly elevated p  005 in the cherry juice group whilst no differences were shown between baseline and placebo trialsthere were significant increases in time in bed total sleep time and sleep efficiency total p  005 with cherry juice supplementationalthough there was no difference in timing of the melatonin circardian rhythm there was a trend to a higher mesor and amplitudeconclusions these data suggest that consumption of a tart cherry juice concentrate provides an increase in exogenous melatonin that is beneficial in improving sleep duration and quality in healthy men and women and might be of benefit in managing disturbed sleep
