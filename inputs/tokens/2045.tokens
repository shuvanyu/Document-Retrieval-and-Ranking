the identification of phenolics from various cultivars of fresh sweet and sour cherries and their protective effects on neuronal cells were comparatively evaluated in this studyphenolics in cherries of four sweet and four sour cultivars were extracted and analyzed for total phenolics total anthocyanins and their antineurodegenerative activitiestotal phenolics in sweet and sour cherries per 100 g ranged from 921 to 1468 and from 1461 to 3124 mg gallic acid equivalents respectivelytotal anthocyanins of sweet and sour cherries ranged from 302 to 766 and from 491 to 1092 mg cyanidin 3glucoside equivalents respectivelyhighperformance liquid chromatography hplc analysis revealed that anthocyanins such as cyanidin and peonidin derivatives were prevalent phenolicshydroxycinnamic acids consisted of neochlorogenic acid chlorogenic acid and pcoumaric acid derivativesglycosides of quercetin kaempferol and isorhamnetin were also foundgenerally sour cherries had higher concentrations of total phenolics than sweet cherries due to a higher concentration of anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acidsa positive linear correlation r2  0985 was revealed between the total anthocyanins measured by summation of individual peaks from hplc analysis and the total anthocyanins measured by the ph differential method indicating that there was in a close agreement with two quantifying methods for measuring anthocyanin contentscherry phenolics protected neuronal cells pc 12 from celldamaging oxidative stress in a dosedependent manner mainly due to anthocyaninsoverall results showed that cherries are rich in phenolics especially in anthocyanins with a strong antineurodegenerative activity and that they can serve as a good source of biofunctional phytochemicals in our diet
