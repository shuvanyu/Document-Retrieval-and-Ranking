melatonin which is contained in certain vegetables may have an influence on circulatory melatonin concentrationsthis study examined the effects of the consumption of vegetables on 6sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations in morning urineninetyfour healthy women aged 2455 were recruited through a city public health center in japanthe women randomly allocated to the intervention group were requested to consume high amounts of six selected vegetables with a target of 350 gday for 65 days while those in the control group were asked to avoid the same six vegetables during the same periodfirstvoid morning urine was collected before and at the end of the intervention period and creatinineadjusted 6sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations were measuredat the end of the intervention period daily mean intake of melatonin from the six vegetables was 12880 ng in the intervention group and 53 ng in the control groupin the intervention group the mean concentration of 6sulfatoxymelatonin changed from 481 95 confidence interval ci 404572 ngmg creatinine to 496 95 ci 428573 ngmg creatinine across the intervention periodin the control group the mean concentration of 6sulfatoxymelatonin changed from 555 95 ci 487632 ngmg creatinine to 508 95 ci 440587 ngmg creatinine across the intervention perioda comparison of the two groups with regard to the changes in the 6sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations across the intervention period showed a significant difference p  003the results indicate that increased consumption of vegetables raises circulatory melatonin concentrations
