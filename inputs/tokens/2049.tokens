although the hormone melatonin is a key factor for the proper functioning of the circadian timing system cts and exogenous melatonin has been shown to be beneficial in cases of cts disturbances a deficit of melatonin has yet to be defined as a disorderthe aim of our study was to collect a normative data set on 24h melatonin excretion in healthy human adults living in a natural environmenturine samples were collected from 75 healthy subjects 45 women30 men mean age 472 sd 195 range 2084 after five consecutive periods 23000700 07001100 11001800 18002300 and 23000700 h 6sulfatoxymelatonin amt6s concentrations were analyzed in duplicate by ibl hamburg using a highly sensitive competitive elisa kittwentyfour houramt6s total amount rho068 p0001 amt6s nighttime excretion rho069 p0001 amt6s morning excretion rho066 p0001 and evening excretion r026 p0023 were negatively associated with age whereas daytime excretion r017 p015 was notthe intrasubject nightday ratio varied up to 105 mean 60 in young subjects aged 2035 and up to 54 mean 28 in older individuals age65the total amount of 24 hamt6s range 7558 microg as well as the amount of amt6s excreted during the nighttime period range 3276074 ngh varied as much as 20fold between individualsour data show an agerelated decline in melatonin excretion in healthy subjects living in a natural environmentthe high interindividual variability of excretion rates may explain why a normative data set is of no use in replacement strategies
