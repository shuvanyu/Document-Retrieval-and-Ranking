background exposure of the us population to polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes is thought to be via exposure to dust and diethowever little work has been done to empirically link body burdens of these compounds to either route of exposureobjectives the primary goal of this research was to evaluate the dietary contribution to pbde body burdens in the united states by linking serum levels to food intakemethods we used two dietary instrumentsa 24hr food recall 24fr and a 1year food frequency questionnaire ffqto examine food intake among participants of the 20032004 national health and nutrition examination surveywe regressed serum concentrations of five pbdes bde congeners 28 47 99 100 and 153 and their sum pbde against diet variables while adjusting for age sex raceethnicity income and body mass indexresults pbde serum concentrations among vegetarians were 23 p  0006 and 27 p  0009 lower than among omnivores for 24fr and 1year ffq respectivelyserum levels of five pbde congeners were associated with consumption of poultry fat low medium and high intake corresponded to geometric mean pbde concentrations of 406 419 and 483 ngg lipid respectively p  00005we observed similar trends for red meat fat which were statistically significant for bde100 and bde153no association was observed between serum pbdes and consumption of dairy or fishresults were similar for both dietary instruments but were more robust using 24frconclusions intake of contaminated poultry and red meat contributes significantly to pbde body burdens in the united states
