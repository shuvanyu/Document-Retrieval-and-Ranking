an analytical method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of serotonin melatonin trans and cispiceid and trans and cisresveratrol using reversedphase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry hplcms with electrospray ionization esi in both positive and negative ionization modeshplc optimal analytical separation was achieved using a mixture of acetonitrile and water with 01 formic acid as the mobile phase in linear gradient elutionthe mass spectrometry parameters were optimized for reliable quantification and the enhanced selectivity and sensitivity selected reaction monitoring mode srm was appliedfor extraction the direct analysis of initial methanol extracts was compared with further ethyl acetate extractionin order to demonstrate the applicability of this analytical method serotonin melatonin trans and cispiceid and trans and cisresveratrol from 24 kinds of commonly consumed fruits were quantifiedthe highest serotonin content was found in plantain while orange bell peppers had the highest melatonin contentgrape samples possessed higher trans and cispiceid and trans and cisresveratrol contents than the other fruitsthe results indicate that the combination of hplcms detection and simple sample preparation allows the rapid and accurate quantification of serotonin melatonin trans and cispiceid and trans and cisresveratrol in fruitscopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
