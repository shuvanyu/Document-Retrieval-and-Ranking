background numerous antioxidant and antiinflammatory agents have been identified in tart cherriesobjective to test the efficacy of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing the symptoms of exercise induced muscle damagemethods this was a randomised placebo controlled crossover designfourteen male college students drank 12 fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo twice a day for eight consecutive daysa bout of eccentric elbow flexion contractions 2  20 maximum contractions was performed on the fourth day of supplementationisometric elbow flexion strength pain muscle tenderness and relaxed elbow angle were recorded before and for four days after the eccentric exercisethe protocol was repeated two weeks later with subjects who took the placebo initially now taking the cherry juice and vice versathe opposite arm performed the eccentric exercise for the second bout to avoid the repeated bout protective effectresults strength loss and pain were significantly less in the cherry juice trial versus placebo time by treatment strength p00001 pain p    0017relaxed elbow angle time by treatment p    085 and muscle tenderness time by treatment p    081 were not different between trialsconclusions these data show efficacy for this cherry juice in decreasing some of the symptoms of exercise induced muscle damagemost notably strength loss averaged over the four days after eccentric exercise was 22 with the placebo but only 4 with the cherry juice
