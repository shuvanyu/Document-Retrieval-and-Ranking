objectives to inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences we conducted a doseresponse chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivationdesign the chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses 4 h 6 h or 8 h time in bed per night which were maintained for 14 consecutive daysthe total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep 0 h time in bedeach study also involved 3 baseline predeprivation days and 3 recovery dayssetting both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral physiological and medical monitoringparticipants a total of n  48 healthy adults ages 2138 participated in the experimentsinterventions noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days or to 0 h for 3 daysall other sleep was prohibitedresults chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative dosedependent deficits in cognitive performance on all taskssubjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditionspolysomnographic variables and delta power in the nonrem sleep eega putative marker of sleep homeostasisdisplayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nightscomparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was losta statistical model revealed that regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation lapses in behavioral alertness were nearlinearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 1584 h se073 hconclusions since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adultssleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benignphysiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 1584 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditionsthis suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological cost which accumulates over time
