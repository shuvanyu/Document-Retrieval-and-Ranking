inhibition of monoamine oxidase is one way to treat depression and anxietythe information now available on the pharmacokinetics of flavonoids and of the components of tobacco prompted an exploration of whether a healthy diet with or without smoking provides active compounds in amounts sufficient to partially inhibit monoamine oxidasea literature search was used to identify dietary monoamine oxidase inhibitors the levels of these compounds in foods the pharmacokinetics of the absorption and distribution and tissue levels observedan estimated daily intake and the expected tissue concentrations were compared with the measured efficacies of the compounds as inhibitors of monoamine oxidasesnorharman harman and quercetin dietary presence pharmacokinetics and tissue levels were consistent with significant levels reaching neuronal monoamine oxidase from the diet or smoking 1234tetrahydroisoquinoline eugenol 1piperoylpiperidine and coumarin were notquercetin was equipotent with norharman as a monoamine oxidase a inhibitor and its metabolite isorhamnetin also inhibitstotal quercetin was the highest of the compounds in the sample dietalthough bioavailability was variable depending on the source a healthy diet contains amounts of quercetin that might give sufficient amounts in brain to induce by monoamine oxidase a inhibition a small decrease in neurotransmitter breakdown
