wholebody petscan studies in brains of tobacco smokers have shown a decrease in monoamine oxidase mao activity which reverts to control level when they quit smokingthe observed decrease in mao activity in smokers is presumably due to their exposure to tobacco constituents that possess maoinhibiting propertiesthe inhibition of mao activity seems however not to be a unique feature of tobacco smoking as subjects with type ii alcoholism have been reported to show a similar decrease in mao activity that reverses when they cease to use alcoholthe present review summarizes the data on maoinhibiting tobacco constituents and explains that the decrease in mao activity observed in alcoholics is probably due to concomitant tobacco useit is concluded that the inhibition of mao by constituents contained in tobacco and tobacco smoke enhances the addiction induced by tobacco smoking
