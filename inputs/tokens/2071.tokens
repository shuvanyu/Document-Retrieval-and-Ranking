cancer metastasis refers to the spread of cancer cells from the primary neoplasm to distant sites where secondary tumors are formed and is the major cause of death from cancernatural phytochemicals containing phenolic compounds have been widely demonstrated to have the capability to prevent cancer metastasisamong phenolic compounds flavonoids are a very large subclass and they are abundant in food and nutraceuticalsthe number of reports demonstrating that flavonoids are an effective natural inhibitor of cancer invasion and metastasis is increasing in the scientific literaturecatechin derivatives epigallocatechin3gallate epigallocatechin epicatechin3gallateand epicatechin are the most studied compounds in this topic so far genisteingenistin silibinin quercetin and anthocyanin have also been widely investigated for their inhibitory activities on invasionmetastasisother flavonoids in dietary vegetable foods that are responsible for antiinvasive and antimetastatic activities of tumors include luteolinapigenin myricetin tangeretin kaempferol glycitein licoricidindaidzein and naringeninto effectively overcome the metastatic cascade including cellcell attachment tissue barrier degradation migration invasion cellmatrix adhesionand angiogenesis it is essential that a bioactive compound prevent tumor cells from metastasizingthis review summarizes the effects of flavonoids on the metastatic cascade and the related proteins the in vitro antiinvasive activity of flavonoids against cancer cells and the effects of flavonoids on antiangiogenic and in vivo antimetastatic modelsthe available scientific evidence indicates that flavonoids are a ubiquitous dietary phenolics subclass and exert extensive in vitro antiinvasive and in vivo antimetastatic activities
