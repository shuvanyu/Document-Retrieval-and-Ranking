the study evaluated the protective effects of purple rice oryza sativa l bran extract pre and its constituents cyanidin and peonidin against angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor vegfthe effects of vegf and pre were examined by in vitro tube formation assays and following 14day coculture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs and fibroblaststhe antiangiogenic mechanism of pre was evaluated by vegfinduced proliferation and migration of huvecs andor human retinal microvascular endothelial cells hrmecs and phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase erk and p38the pre significantly suppressed vegfinduced tube formation proliferation and migration in huvecs and hrmecs as well as phosphorylation of erk and p38cyanidin and peonidin also suppressed the proliferation and migration induced by vegfthese findings indicate that pre and anthocyanidins suppress vegfinduced angiogenesis by inhibiting proliferation and migration and suggest that the inhibition of phosphorylatederk and p38 may be involved in the underlying mechanismcopyright  2011 john wiley  sons ltd
