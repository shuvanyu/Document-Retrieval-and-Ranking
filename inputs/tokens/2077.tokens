a great deal of effort is now being devoted to the development of new drugs that hopefully will control the spread of inoperable cancer by safely inhibiting tumorevoked angiogenesishowever there is growing evidence that certain practical nutritional measures have the potential to slow tumor angiogenesis and it is reasonable to anticipate that by combining several measures that work in distinct but complementary ways to impede the angiogenic process a clinically useful multifocal angiostatic therapy mat might be devisedseveral measures which might reasonably be included in such a protocol are discussed below and include a lowfat lowglycemic index vegan diet which may downregulate the systemic igfi activity that supports angiogenesis supplemental omega3rich fish oil which has been shown to inhibit endothelial expression of flk1 a functionally crucial receptor for vegf and also can suppress tumor production of proangiogenic eicosanoids highdose selenium which has recently been shown to inhibit tumor production of vegf green tea polyphenols which can suppress endothelial responsiveness to both vegf and fibroblast growth factor and highdose glycine whose recently reported angiostatic activity may reflect inhibition of endothelial cell mitosis possibly mediated by activation of glycinegated chloride channelsin light of evidence that tumorevoked angiogenesis has a high requirement for copper copper depletion may have exceptional potential as an angiostatic measure and is most efficiently achieved with the copperchelating drug tetrathiomolybdateif logistical difficulties make it difficult to acquire this experimental drug highdose zinc supplementation can achieve a slower depletion of the bodys copper pool and in any case can be used as maintenance therapy to maintain an adequate level of copper depletiona provisional protocol is offered for a nutritionally based mat entailing a vegan diet and supplemental intakes of fish oil selenium green tea polyphenols glycine and zincinasmuch as cox2 is overexpressed in many cancers and camp can boost tumor production of various angiogenic factors as well as autogenous growth factors adjunctive use of cox2specific nsaids may be warranted in some cases
