a number of epidemiological studies have investigated associations between various phytochemicals and cancer riskphytoestrogens and carotenoids are the two most commonly studied classes of phytochemicals phytosterols isothiocyanates and chlorophyll also have been investigated although to a much lesser extentbecause there have been no systematic reviews of the literature on all phytochemicals and cancer risk to date this article systematically reviews 96 published epidemiological studies that examined associations between phytochemicals and cancer riskmost studies found null associations between individual phytochemicals and cancer risk at various sitesin addition results from past studies have been largely inconsistent and observed associations have been of relatively modest magnitudethe most consistent protective effects were observed for higher levelsdietary intake serum plasma or urinary metabolitesof βcarotene and renal cell cancer βcryptoxanthin and lung cancer isothiocyanates and lung cancer isothiocyanates and gastrointestinal cancer lignans and postmenopausal breast cancer and flavonoids and lung canceralthough elevated risk of certain cancers with higher levels of certain phytochemicals was observed an insufficient pool of studies examining the same associations or inconsistent findings across studies limit the ability to conclude that any one phytochemical increases cancer riskadditional research is needed to support previously identified associations in cases where only one study has examined a particular relationshipimportantly continued research efforts are needed to evaluate the cumulative and interactive effects of numerous phytochemicals and phytochemicalrich foods on cancer risk
