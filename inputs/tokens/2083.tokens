persistent infection with a highrisk human papillomavirus hrhpv is generally accepted as a necessary cause of cervical cancerhowever cervical cancer is a rare complication of an hrhpv infection since most such infections are transient not even giving rise to cervical lesionson average it takes 1215 years before a persistent hrhpv infection may ultimately via consecutive premalignant stages ie cin lesions lead to an overt cervical carcinomathis argues that hpvinduced cervical carcinogenesis is multistep in naturein this review the data from hrhpvmediated in vitro transformation studies and those obtained from analysis of clinical specimens have been merged into a cervical cancer progression modelaccording to this model a crucial decision maker in the early stages following infection involves individual susceptibility for certain hpv types depending on the genetic makeup of immune surveillance determinantsonce a cin lesion has developed altered transcriptional regulation of the viral e6e7 oncogenes resulting in genomic instability and distinguishing the process of cell transformation from a productive viral infection probably provides the subsequent important step towards malignancythe additional epigenetic alterations that subsequently accumulate in highgrade cin lesions may result in overt malignancy via immortality and growth conditions that gradually become less sensitive to growthmodulating influences mediated by cytokines and cellcell and cellmatrix adhesionsthe potential implications of hrhpv testing and some other biomarkers deduced from this model for cervical screening and the clinical management of cin disease are also discussedcopyright 2006 pathological society of great britain and irelandpublished by john wiley  sons ltd
