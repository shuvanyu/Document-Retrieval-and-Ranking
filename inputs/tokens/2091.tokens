the effects of the glycemic index gi of carbohydrate eaten the previous night on the glycemic response to a standard test meal eaten subsequently in the morning breakfast was studiedon separate evenings normal subjects ate low or highgi test meals of the same nutrient compositionthe dinners consisted of single foods in two experiments and mixed meals containing several foods in the thirdthe differences between the observed glycemic responses to low and highgi dinners were predicted by their gisthe glycemic responses to breakfast were significantly lower on mornings after lowgi dinners than after highgi dinnerseating at dinner foods with different fiber contents but the same gi had no effect on postbreakfast glycemiawe conclude that the gi predicts the difference between glycemic responses of mixed dinner meals breakfast carbohydrate tolerance is improved when lowgi foods are eaten the previous evening
