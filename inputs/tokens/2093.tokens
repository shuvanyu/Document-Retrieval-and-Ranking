breakfasts of lentils or wholemeal bread of identical carbohydrate content were taken by seven healthy volunteersthe lentils produced a significant 71 p less than 0001 reduction in the blood glucose area and flattened the plasma insulin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses by comparison with the breadin addition the lentil breakfast was followed by a significantly flatter blood glucose response to the standard bread lunch which followed 4 h later by 38 p less than 001the blood glucose pattern was mimicked by feeding the bread breakfast slowly over the 4 h before lunchgiving a bread breakfast containing a quarter of the carbohydrate reduced the breakfast glucose profile but resulted in a significantly impaired blood glucose response to lunch 168 of control p less than 001these results together with breath hydrogen studies performed on a separate group of four volunteers indicate that the flattened response to lentils is not due to carbohydrate malabsorptionslow release or lente carbohydrate foods such as lentils may form a useful part of the diets of those with impaired carbohydrate tolerance
