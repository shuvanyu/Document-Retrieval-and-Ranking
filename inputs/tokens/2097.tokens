background the objective of this study was to examine the relation between dietary fats and semen quality parametersmethods data from 99 men with complete dietary and semen quality data were analyzedfatty acid levels in sperm and seminal plasma were measured using gas chromatography in a subgroup of men n  23linear regression was used to determine associations while adjusting for potential confoundersresults men were primarily caucasian 89 with a mean sd age of 364 53 years 71 were overweight or obese and 67 were never smokershigher total fat intake was negatively related to total sperm count and concentrationmen in the highest third of total fat intake had 43 95 confidence interval ci 6214 lower total sperm count and 38 95 ci 5810 lower sperm concentration than men in the lowest third ptrend  001this association was driven by intake of saturated fatslevels of saturated fatty acids in sperm were also negatively related to sperm concentration r 053 but saturated fat intake was unrelated to sperm levels r  009higher intake of omega3 polyunsaturated fats was related to a more favorable sperm morphologymen in the highest third of omega3 fatty acids had 19 0435 higher normal morphology than men in the lowest third ptrend  002conclusions in this preliminary crosssectional study high intake of saturated fats was negatively related to sperm concentration whereas higher intake of omega3 fats was positively related to sperm morphologyfurther studies with larger samples are now required to confirm these findings
