male reproductive disorders that are of interest from an environmental point of view include sexual dysfunction infertility cryptorchidism hypospadias and testicular cancerseveral reports suggest declining sperm counts and increase of these reproductive disorders in some areas during some time periods past 50 yearsexcept for testicular cancer this evidence is circumstantial and needs cautious interpretationhowever the male germ line is one of the most sensitive tissues to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation radiant heat and a number of known toxicantsso far occupational hazards are the best documented risk factors for impaired male reproductive function and include physical exposures radiant heat ionizing radiation high frequency electromagnetic radiation chemical exposures some solvents as carbon disulfide and ethylene glycol ethers some pesticides as dibromochloropropane ethylendibromide and ddtdde some heavy metals as inorganic lead and mercury and work processes such as metal weldingimproved working conditions in affluent countries have dramatically decreased known hazardous workplace exposures but millions of workers in less affluent countries are at risk from reproductive toxicantsnew data show that environmental lowlevel exposure to biopersistent pollutants in the diet may pose a risk to people in all parts of the worldfor other toxicants the evidence is only suggestive and further evaluation is needed before conclusions can be drawnwhether compounds as phthalates bisphenol a and boron that are present in a large number of industrial and consumer products entails a risk remains to be establishedthe same applies to psychosocial stressors and use of mobile phonesfinally there are data indicating a particular vulnerability of the fetal testis to toxicantsfor instance maternal tobacco smokingtime has come where male reproductive toxicity should be addressed form entirely new angles including exposures very early in life
