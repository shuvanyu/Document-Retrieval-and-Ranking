levels of contaminants in fish are of particular interest because of the potential risk to humans who consume themwhile attention has focused on selfcaught fish most of the fish eaten by the american public comes from commercial sourceswe sampled 11 types of fish and shellfish obtained from supermarkets and specialty fish markets in new jersey and analyzed them for arsenic cadmium chromium lead manganese mercury and seleniumwe test the null hypothesis that metal levels do not vary among fish types and we consider whether the levels of any metals could harm the fish themselves or their predators or pose a health risk for human consumersthere were significant interspecific differences for all metals and no fish types had the highest levels of more than two metalsthere were few significant correlations kendall tau among metals for the three most numerous fish yellowfin tuna bluefish and flounder the correlations were generally low below 040 and many correlations were negativeonly manganese and lead positively were correlated for tuna bluefish and flounderthe levels of most metals were below those known to cause adverse effects in the fish themselveshowever the levels of arsenic lead mercury and selenium in some fish were in the range known to cause some sublethal effects in sensitive predatory birds and mammals and in some fish exceeded healthbased standardsthe greatest risk from different metals resided in different fish the species of fish with the highest levels of a given metal sometimes exceeded the human health guidance or standards for that metalthus the risk information given to the public mainly about mercury does not present a complete picturethe potential of harm from other metals suggests that people not only should eat smaller quantities of fish known to accumulate mercury but also should eat a diversity of fish to avoid consuming unhealthy quantities of other heavy metalshowever consumers should bear in mind that standards have a margin of safety
