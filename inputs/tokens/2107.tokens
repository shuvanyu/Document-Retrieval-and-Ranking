background dietary trans fatty acids dtfa are primarily synthetic compounds that have been introduced only recently little is known about their behavioral effectsdtfa inhibit production of omega3 fatty acids which experimentally have been shown to reduce aggressionpotential behavioral effects of dtfa merit investigationwe sought to determine whether dtfa are associated with aggressionirritabilitymethodolgyprinicpal findings we capitalized on baseline dietary and behavioral assessments in an existing clinical trial to analyze the relationship of dtfa to aggressionof 1018 broadly sampled baseline subjects the 945 adult men and women who brought a completed dietary survey to their baseline visit are the target of this analysissubjects seen 19992004 were not on lipid medications and were without ldlcholesterol extremes diabetes hiv cancer or heart diseaseoutcomes assessed adverse behaviors with impact on others overt aggression scale modifiedaggression subscale primary behavioral endpoint life history of aggression conflict tactics scale and selfrated impatience and irritabilitythe association of dtfa to aggression was analyzed via regression and ordinal logit unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounders sex age education alcohol and smokingadditional analyses stratified on sex age and ethnicity and examined the prospective associationgreater dtfa were strongly significantly associated with greater aggression with dtfa more consistently predictive than other assessed aggression predictorsthe relationship was upheld with adjustment for confounders was preserved across sex age and ethnicity strata and held crosssectionally and prospectivelyconclusionssignificance this study provides the first evidence linking dtfa with behavioral irritability and aggressionwhile confounding is always a concern in observational studies factors including strength and consistency of association biological gradient temporality and biological plausibility add weight to the prospect of a causal connectionour results may have relevance to public policy determinations regarding dietary trans fatsclinicaltrialsgov  nct00330980
