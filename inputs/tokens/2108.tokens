transfatty acids tfa have adverse effects on blood lipids but whether tfa from different sources are associated with risk of cvd remains unresolvedthe objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between tfa intake from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils phvo partially hydrogenated fish oils phfo and ruminant fat rtfa and risks of death of cvd chd cerebrovascular diseases and sudden death in the norwegian counties study a populationbased cohort studybetween 1974 and 1988 participants were examined for up to three timesfat intake was assessed with a semiquantitative ffqa total of 71464 men and women were followed up through 2007hazard ratios hr and 95  ci were estimated with cox regressionenergy from tfa was compared to energy from all other sources carbohydrates or unsaturated cisfatty acids with different multivariable modelsduring followup 3870 subjects died of cvd 2383 of chd 732 of cerebrovascular diseases and 243 of sudden deathsignificant risks comparing highest to lowest intake category were found for tfa from phvo and chd hr 123 95  ci 100 150 and cerebrovascular diseases hr 065 95  ci 045 094 tfa from phfo and cvd hr 114 95  ci 103 126 and cerebrovascular diseases hr 132 95  ci 104 169 and rtfa intake and cvd hr 130 95  ci 105 161 chd hr 150 95  ci 111 203 and sudden death hr 273 95  ci 119 625 in womenthese associations with rtfa intake were not significant in men p interaction  001the present study supports that tfa intake irrespective of source increases cvd riskwhether tfa from phvo decreases risk of cerebrovascular diseases warrants further investigation
