radiation is an important modality in treating people with cancer especially when surgical intervention is impracticable or might debilitate the patienthowever effective use of ionizing radiation is compromised by the side effects that result from radiationinduced damage to normal tissuethe use of radioprotective compounds which can selectively protect normal tissues against radiation injury is of immense use because in addition to association with protecting the normal tissue it will also permits use of higher doses of radiation to obtain better cancer control and possible curehowever till date no ideal radioprotectors are available as most synthetic compounds are toxic at their optimal concentrationsplants commonly used as dietary and or therapeutic agents have recently been the focus of attention since in most cases they are nontoxic and are easily accepted for human useginger the rhizomes of zingiber officinale roscoe zingiberaceae has widely been used as both culinary and medicinal agentpreclinical studies carried out in the last decade has shown that ginger and its phytochemicals dehydrozingerone zingerone possess radioprotective effects in laboratory animals and in cultured cells in vitrothe hydroalcoholic extract of ginger rhizome when administered either through intraperitoneal or oral route was effective in protecting against gamma radiationinduced sickness and mortalitythe phytochemicals dehydrogingerone and zingerone present in ginger are also shown to protect mice against radiationinduced sickness and mortalitymechanistic studies have indicated that the free radical scavenging antioxidant affects antiinflammatory and anticlastogenic effects may contribute towards the observed protectionadditionally studies with tumor bearing mice have also shown that zingerone selectively protects the normal tissues against the tumoricidal effects of radiationthis review for the first time summarizes the results related to the radioprotective properties and also emphasizes the aspects that warrant future research to establish its activity and utility as a radioprotective agent
