excessive production of reactive oxygen species has been observed following acute and chronic exposure to radiation in animal models which can lead to several detrimental and irreversible outcomes in vital organsaim of this study was to determine the oxidative stress status in radiology unit workers which are exposed to persistent lowdose radiationmethods  a group of 32 radiology unit employees along with 32 sex and agematched hospital workers not exposed to lowdose radiation were recruited from two separate hospitals for the studyexposed subjects showed higher levels of lipid peroxidation p0009 total antioxidant capacity p00006 and thiol groups p003it is concluded that occupationally exposed individuals are oxidatively stressed and precautions such as antioxidant therapy seems reasonable
