background dietary antioxidants may protect against dna damage induced by endogenous and exogenous sources including ionizing radiation ir but data from irexposed human populations are limitedobjective the objective was to examine the association between the frequency of chromosome translocations as a biomarker of cumulative dna damage and intakes of vitamins c and e and carotenoids in 82 male airline pilotsdesign dietary intakes were estimated by using a selfadministered semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnairetranslocations were scored by using fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome paintsnegative binomial regression was used to estimate rate ratios and 95 cis adjusted for potential confoundersresults significant and inverse associations were observed between translocation frequency and intakes of vitamin c βcarotene βcryptoxanthin and luteinzeaxanthin from food p  005translocation frequency was not associated with the intake of vitamin e αcarotene or lycopene from food total vitamin c or e from food and supplements or vitamin c or e or multivitamin supplementsthe adjusted rate ratios 95 ci for median compared with median servings per week of highvitamin c fruit and vegetables citrus fruit and green leafy vegetables were 061 043 086 064 046 089 and 059 043 081 respectivelythe strongest inverse association was observed for median compared with median combined intakes of vitamins c and e βcarotene βcryptoxanthin and luteinzeaxanthin from food 027 014 055conclusion high combined intakes of vitamins c and e βcarotene βcryptoxanthin and luteinzeaxanthin from food or a diet high in their food sources may protect against cumulative dna damage in irexposed persons
