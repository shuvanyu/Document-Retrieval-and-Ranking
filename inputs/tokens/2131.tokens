the distribution and behaviour of the naturalseries alphaemitter polonium210 in the marine environment has been under study for many years primarily due to its enhanced bioaccumulation its strong affinity for binding with certain internal tissues and its importance as a contributor to the natural radiation dose received by marine biota as well as humans consuming seafoodsresults from studies spanning nearly 5 decades show that 210po concentrations in organisms vary widely among the different phylogenic groups as well as between the different tissues of a given speciessuch variation results in 210po concentration factors ranging from approximately 103 to over 106 depending upon the organism or tissue considered210po210pb ratios in marine species are generally greater than unity and tend to increase up the food chain indicating that 210po is preferentially taken up by organisms compared to its progenitor 210pbthe effective transfer of 210po up the food chain is primarily due to the high degree of assimilation of the radionuclide from ingested food and its subsequent strong retention in the organismsin some cases this mechanism may lead to an apparent biomagnification of 210po at the higher trophic levelvarious pelagic species release 210po and 210pb packaged in organic biodetrital particles that sink and remove these radionuclides from the upper water column a biogeochemical process which coupled with scavenging rates of this radionuclide pair is being examined as a possible proxy for estimating downward organic carbon fluxes in the seadata related to preferential bioaccumulation in various organisms their tissues resultant radiation doses to these species and the processes by which 210po is transferred and recycled through the food web are discussedin addition the main gaps in our present knowledge and proposed areas for future studies on the biogeochemical behaviour of 210po and its use as a tracer of oceanographic processes are highlighted in this reviewcopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
