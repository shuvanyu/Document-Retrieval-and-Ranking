the fukushima daiichi release of radionuclides into ocean waters caused significant local and global concern regarding the spread of radioactive materialwe report unequivocal evidence that pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis transported fukushimaderived radionuclides across the entire north pacific oceanwe measured Î³emitting radionuclides in californiacaught tunas and found 134cs 40  14 bq kg1 and elevated 137cs 63  15 bq kg1 in 15 pacific bluefin tuna sampled in august 2011we found no 134cs and background concentrations 1 bq kg1 of 137cs in prefukushima bluefin and postfukushima yellowfin tunas ruling out elevated radiocesium uptake before 2011 or in california waters postfukushimathese findings indicate that pacific bluefin tuna can rapidly transport radionuclides from a point source in japan to distant ecoregions and demonstrate the importance of migratory animals as transport vectors of radionuclidesother large highly migratory marine animals make extensive use of waters around japan and these animals may also be transport vectors of fukushimaderived radionuclides to distant regions of the north and south pacific oceansthese results reveal tools to trace migration origin using the presence of 134cs and potentially migration timing using 134cs137cs ratios in highly migratory marine species in the pacific ocean
