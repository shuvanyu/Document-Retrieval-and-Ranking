introduction to determine the tobacco industrys policy and action with respect to radioactive polonium 210 210po in cigarette smoke and to assess the longterm risk of lung cancer caused by alpha particle deposits in the lungs of regular smokersmethods analysis of major tobacco industries internal secret documents on cigarette radioactivity made available online by the master settlement agreement in 1998results the documents show that the industry was well aware of the presence of a radioactive substance in tobacco as early as 1959furthermore the industry was not only cognizant of the potential cancerous growth in the lungs of regular smokers but also did quantitative radiobiological calculations to estimate the longterm 25 years lung radiation absorption dose rad of ionizing alpha particles emitted from the cigarette smokeour own calculations of lung rad of alpha particles match closely the rad estimated by the industryaccording to the environmental protection agency the industrys and our estimate of longterm lung rad of alpha particles causes 120138 lung cancer deaths per year per 1000 regular smokersacid wash was discovered in 1980 to be highly effectively in removing 210po from the tobacco leaves however the industry avoided its use for concerns that acid media would ionize nicotine converting it into a poorly absorbable form into the brain of smokers thus depriving them of the much sought after instant nicotine kick sensationconclusions the evidence of lung cancer risk caused by cigarette smoke radioactivity is compelling enough to warrant its removal
