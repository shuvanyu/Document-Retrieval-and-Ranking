the sensitivity of a large number of antibioticresistant and nonresistant helicobacter pylori isolates to the antiadhesion effect of a highmolecularmass nondialysable constituent of cranberry juice was testedconfluent monolayers of gastric cell line in microtiter plate wells were exposed to bacterial suspensions prepared from 83 h pylori isolates from antibiotictreated and untreated patients in the presence and absence of the cranberry constituenturease assay was used to calculate the percentage of adhesion inhibitionin two thirds of the isolates adhesion to the gastric cells was inhibited by 02 mgml of the nondialysable materialthere was no relationship between the antiadhesion effect of the cranberry material and metronidazole resistance in isolates from either treated or untreated patients n35only 13 isolates 16 were resistant to both the nondialysable material and metronidazole and 30 36 were resistant to the nondialysable material alonethere was no crossresistance to the nondialysable material and metronidazolethese data suggest that a combination of antibiotics and a cranberry preparation may improve h pylori eradication
