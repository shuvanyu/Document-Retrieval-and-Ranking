cranberry juice is known to inhibit bacterial adhesionwe examined the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on the adhesion of oral streptococci strains labeled with 3hthymidine to salivacoated hydroxyapatite beads shawhen the bacterial cells were momentarily exposed to cranberry juice their adherence to sha decreased significantly compared with the control p  001their hydrophobicity also decreased dependently with the concentration of cranberry juicewe also evaluated the inhibitory effect of cranberry juice on biofilm formationby using a microplate system we found that the high molecular mass constituents of cranberry juice inhibited the biofilm formation of the tested streptococcithe inhibitory activity was related to the reduction of the hydrophobicitythe present findings suggest that cranberry juice components can inhibit colonization by oral streptococci to the tooth surface and can thus slow development of dental plaquecopyright blackwell munksgaard 2004
