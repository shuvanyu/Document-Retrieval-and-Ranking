cranberry juice cocktail cjc has been shown to inhibit the formation of biofilm by uropathogenic escherichia coliin order to investigate whether the antiadhesive components could reach the urinary tract after oral consumption of cjc a volunteer was given 16â€‰oz of either water or cjcurine samples were collected at 0 2 4 6 and 8 hours after consumption of a single dosethe ability of compounds in the urine to influence bacterial adhesion was tested for six clinical uropathogenic e coli strains including four pfimbriated strains b37 cft073 bf1023 and j96 and two strains not expressing pfimbriae but exhibiting mannoseresistant hemagglutination b73 and b78a nonfimbriated strain hb101 was used as a controlatomic force microscopy afm was used to measure the adhesion force between a silicon nitride probe and bacteria treated with urine sampleswithin 2 hours after cjc consumption bacteria of the clinical strains treated with the corresponding urine sample demonstrated lower adhesion forces than those treated with urine collected before cjc consumptionthe adhesion forces continued decreasing with time after cjc consumption over the 8hour measurement periodthe adhesion forces of bacteria after exposure to urine collected following water consumption did not changehb101 showed low adhesion forces following both water and cjc consumption and these did not change over timethe afm adhesion force measurements were consistent with the results of a hemagglutination assay confirming that oral consumption of cjc could act against adhesion of uropathogenic e coli
