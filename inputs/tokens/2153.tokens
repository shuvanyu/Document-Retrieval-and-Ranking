multidrugresistant escherichia coli sequence type 131 st131 has recently emerged as a globally distributed cause of extraintestinal infections in humansdiverse factors have been investigated as explanations for st131s rapid and successful dissemination including transmission through animal contact and consumption of food as suggested by the detection of st131 in a number of nonhuman speciesfor example st131 has recently been identified as a cause of clinical infection in companion animals and poultry and both host groups have been confirmed as faecal carriers of st131moreover a high degree of similarity has been shown among certain st131 isolates from humans companion animals and poultry based on resistance characteristics and genomic background and human and companion animal st131 isolates tend to exhibit similar virulence genotypeshowever most st131 isolates from poultry appear to possess specific virulence genes that are typically absent from human and companion animal isolates including genes associated with avian pathogenic e colisince the number of reported animal and foodassociated st131 isolates is quite small the role of nonhuman host species in the emergence dissemination and transmission of st131 to humans remains unclearnevertheless given the profound public health importance of the emergent st131 clonal group even the limited available evidence indicates a pressing need for further careful study of this significant questioncopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
