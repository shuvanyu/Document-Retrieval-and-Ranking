the etiology of bacterial vaginosis is unknown and there are no longterm therapies for preventing this frequently recurring conditionvaginal douching has been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis in observational studieshowever this association may be due to confounding by indicationthat is confounding by women douching in response to vaginal symptoms associated with bacterial vaginosisthe authors used marginal structural modeling to estimate the causal effect of douching on bacterial vaginosis risk while controlling for this confounding effectin 19992002 nonpregnant women n  3620 were recruited into a prospective study when they visited one of 12 public health clinics in birmingham alabama for routine careparticipants were assessed quarterly for 1 yearbacterial vaginosis was based on a nugents gram stain score of 7 or higherthirtytwo percent of participants douched in every study interval and 430 never douchedof the 12349 study visits 402 were classified as involving bacterial vaginosisthe relative risk for regular douching as compared with no douching was 121 95 confidence interval 108 138these findings indicate that douching confers increased risk of disruption of vaginal florain the absence of a large randomized trial these findings provide the best evidence to date for a risk of bacterial vaginosis associated with douching
