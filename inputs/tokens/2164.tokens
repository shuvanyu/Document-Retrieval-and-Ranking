purpose of review this review provides a comprehensive selection of the latest clinical trial results in antimigraine treatmentrecent findings the oral calcitonine generelated peptide antagonist telcagepant is efficacious in acute treatmentcompared to triptans its efficacy is almost comparable but its tolerance is superiorthe same is true for the 5ht1f agonist lasmiditan another agent devoid of vascular effectstriptans as other drugs are more efficient if taken early but nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and analgesics remain useful for acute treatment according to several metaanalysessinglepulse transcranial magnetic stimulation during the aura rendered more patients painfree 39 than sham stimulation 22 in one studytopiramate could be effective for migrainous vertigo but it did not prevent transformation to chronic migraine in patients with high attack frequencyonabotulinumtoxin a was effective for chronic migraine and well tolerated but the therapeutic gain over placebo was modest the clinical profile of responders remains to be determined before widespread useoccipital nerve stimulation was effective in intractable chronic migraine with 39 of responders compared to 6 after sham stimulationthis and other neuromodulation techniques such as sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation are promising treatments for medically refractory patients but large controlled trials are necessaryone study suggests that outcome of patent foramen ovale closure in migraine might depend on anatomic and functional characteristicssummary drugs with a better efficacy or sideeffect profile than triptans may soon become available for acute treatmentthe future may also look brighter for some of the very disabled chronic migraineurs thanks to novel drug and neuromodulation therapies
