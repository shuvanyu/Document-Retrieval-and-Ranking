chronic fatigue syndrome cfs is a debilitating disease characterized by unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of accompanying symptoms the pathology of which is incompletely understoodmany cfs patients complain of gut dysfunctionin fact patients with cfs are more likely to report a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome ibs a common functional disorder of the gut and experience ibsrelated symptomsrecently evidence for interactions between the intestinal microbiota mucosal barrier function and the immune system have been shown to play a role in the disorders pathogenesisstudies examining the microecology of the gastrointestinal gi tract have identified specific microorganisms whose presence appears related to disease in cfs a role for altered intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of the disease has recently been suggestedmucosal barrier dysfunction promoting bacterial translocation has also been observedfinally an altered mucosal immune system has been associated with the diseasein this article we discuss the interplay between these factors in cfs and how they could play a significant role in gi dysfunction by modulating the activity of the enteric nervous system the intrinsic innervation of the gutif an altered intestinal microbiota mucosal barrier dysfunction and aberrant intestinal immunity contribute to the pathogenesis of cfs therapeutic efforts to modify gut microbiota could be a means to modulate the development andor progression of this disorderfor example the administration of probiotics could alter the gut microbiota improve mucosal barrier function decrease proinflammatory cytokines and have the potential to positively influence mood in patients where both emotional symptoms and inflammatory immune signals are elevatedprobiotics also have the potential to improve gut motility which is dysfunctional in many cfs patients
