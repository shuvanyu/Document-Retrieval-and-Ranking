objective to determine the magnitude of the decrease in the risk of retinopathy progression observed with intensive treatment and its relationship to baseline retinopathy severity and duration of followupdesign randomized clinical trial with 3 to 9 years of followupsetting and patients between 1983 and 1989 29 centers enrolled 1441 patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus aged 13 to 39 years including 726 patients with no retinopathy and a duration of diabetes of 1 to 5 years primary prevention cohort and 715 patients with very mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and a duration of diabetes of 1 to 15 years secondary intervention cohortninetyfive percent of all scheduled examinations were completedinterventions intensive treatment consisted of the administration of insulin at least three times a day by injection or pump with doses adjusted based on selfblood glucose monitoring and with the goal of normoglycemiaconventional treatment consisted of one or two daily insulin injectionsoutcome measures change between baseline and followup visits on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study retinopathy severity scale assessed with masked gradings of stereoscopic color fundus photographs obtained every 6 monthsresults cumulative 85year rates of retinopathy progression by three or more steps at two consecutive visits were 541 with conventional treatment and 115 with intensive treatment in the primary prevention cohort and 492 and 171 in the secondary intervention cohortat the 6 and 12month visits a small adverse effect of intensive treatment was noted early worsening followed by a beneficial effect that increased in magnitude with timebeyond 35 years of followup the risk of progression was five or more times lower with intensive treatment than with conventional treatmentonce progression occurred subsequent recovery was at least two times more likely with intensive treatment than with conventional treatmenttreatment effects were similar in all baseline retinopathy severity subgroupsconclusions the results of the diabetes control and complications trial strongly support the recommendation that most patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus use intensive treatment aiming for levels of glycemia as close to the nondiabetic range as is safely possible
