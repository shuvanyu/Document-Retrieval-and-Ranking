commercial literature on various probiotic products suggests that they can be taken before meals during meals or after meals or even without mealsthis has led to serious confusion for the industry and the consumerthe objective of our study was to examine the impact of the time of administration with respect to mealtime and the impact of the buffering capacity of the food on the survival of probiotic microbes during gastrointestinal transitwe used an in vitro digestive system ividis model of the upper gastrointestinal tract to examine the survival of a commercial multistrain probiotic protecflorthis product in a capsule form contains four different microbes two lactobacilli lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 bifidobacterium longum r0175 and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardiienumeration during and after transit of the stomach and duodenal models showed that survival of all the bacteria in the product was best when given with a meal or 30 minutes before a meal cooked oatmeal with milkprobiotics given 30 minutes after the meal did not survive in high numberssurvival in milk with 1 milk fat and oatmealmilk gruel were significantly better than apple juice or spring waters boulardii was not affected by time of meal or the buffering capacity of the mealthe protein content of the meal was probably not as important for the survival of the bacteria as the fat contentwe conclude that ideally nonenteric coated bacterial probiotic products should be taken with or just prior to a meal containing some fats
