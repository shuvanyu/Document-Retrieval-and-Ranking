background the aging process can lead to a decline in cellular immunitytherefore the elderly could benefit from safe and effective interventions that restore cellular immune functionsobjective we determined whether dietary supplementation with the known immunostimulating probiotic bifidobacterium lactis hn019 could enhance aspects of cellular immunity in elderly subjectsdesign thirty healthy elderly volunteers age range 6384 y median 69 y participated in a 3stage dietary supplementation trial lasting 9 wkduring stage 1 runin subjects consumed lowfat milk 200 ml twice daily for 3 wk as a basediet controlduring stage 2 intervention they consumed milk supplemented with b lactis hn019 in a typical dose 5 x 1010 organismsd or a low dose 5 x 109 organismsd for 3 wkduring stage 3 washout they consumed lowfat milk for 3 wkchanges in the relative proportions of leukocyte subsets and ex vivo leukocyte phagocytic and tumorcellkilling activity were determined longitudinally by assaying peripheral blood samplesresults increases in the proportions of total helper cd4 and activated cd25 t lymphocytes and natural killer cells were measured in the subjects blood after consumption of b lactis hn019the ex vivo phagocytic capacity of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear phagocytes and the tumoricidal activity of natural killer cells were also elevated after b lactis hn019 consumptionthe greatest changes in immunity were found in subjects who had poor pretreatment immune responsesin general the 2 doses of b lactis hn019 had similar effectivenessconclusion b lactis hn019 could be an effective probiotic dietary supplement for enhancing some aspects of cellular immunity in the elderly
