this study was aimed at determining the probiotic potential of a large number of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from fruit and vegetablessurvival under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions showed that 35 of the strains mainly belonging to the species lactobacillus plantarum maintained high cell densitiesselected strains did not affect the immunemediation by caco2 cellsall strains stimulated all 27 immunemediators by peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmca significant p005 p001 increase of the major part of cytokines and growth factors was founda few chemokines were stimulatedimmunemediators with proinflammatory activity il17 eotaxin and ifnγ were significantly p001 stimulated by all strains followed by il1bip10il6mip1αstimulation of il12 il2 and il7 was strain dependentonly a few strains increased the synthesis of cytokines with antiinflammatory activitysix l plantarum strains were further selectedfour were defined as the strongly adhesive strains more than 40 bacteria adhering to one caco2 cell and 2 as the adhesive strains 540 bacteria adhering to one caco2 cellfive strains grew and acidified chemically defined medium with fructooligosaccharides fos as the only carbon sourceendproducts of fos fermentation were foundall strains inhibited enterohemorragic escherichia coli k12 and bacillus megaterium f6 isolated from human sourcesthe results of this study showed that some autochthonous lactic acid bacteria from raw fruit and vegetables have functional features to be considered as novel probiotic candidatescopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
