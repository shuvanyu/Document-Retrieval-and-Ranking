objectives while fecal microbiota transplantation fmt is historically known to be an effective means to treat recurrent clostridium difficile infection cdi refractory to standard antibiotic therapies the procedure is rarely performedat least some of the reasons for limited availability are those of practicality including aesthetic concerns and costs of donor screeningthe objective of this study was to overcome these barriers in our clinical fmt programmethods we report clinical experience with 43 consecutive patients who were treated with fmt for recurrent cdi since inception of this program at the university of minnesotaduring this time we simplified donor identification and screening by moving from patientidentified individual donors to standard volunteer donorsmaterial preparation shifted from the endoscopy suite to a standardized process in the laboratory and ultimately to banking frozen processed fecal material that is ready to use when neededresults standardization of material preparation significantly simplified the practical aspects of fmt without loss of apparent efficacy in clearing recurrent cdiapproximately 30 of the patients had underlying inflammatory bowel disease and fmt was equally effective in this groupconclusions several key steps in the standardization of donor material preparation significantly simplified the clinical practice of fmt for recurrent cdi in patients failing antibiotic therapy
