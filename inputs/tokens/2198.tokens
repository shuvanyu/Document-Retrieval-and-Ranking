purpose singlevariable analyses have associated physical activity diet and obesity with survival after breast cancerthis report investigates interactions among these variablespatients and methods a prospective study was performed of 1490 women diagnosed and treated for earlystage breast cancer between 1991 and 2000enrollment was an average of 2 years postdiagnosisonly seven women were lost to followup through december 2005results in univariate analysis reduced mortality was weakly associated with higher vegetablefruit consumption increased physical activity and a body mass index that was neither low weight nor obesein a multivariate cox model only the combination of consuming five or more daily servings of vegetablesfruits and accumulating 540 metabolic equivalent tasksminwk equivalent to walking 30 minutes 6 dwk was associated with a significant survival advantage hazard ratio 056 95 ci 031 to 098the approximate 50 reduction in risk associated with these healthy lifestyle behaviors was observed in both obese and nonobese women although fewer obese women were physically active with a healthy dietary pattern 16 v 30among those who adhered to this healthy lifestyle there was no apparent effect of obesity on survivalthe effect was stronger in women who had hormone receptorpositive cancersconclusion a minority of breast cancer survivors follow a healthy lifestyle that includes both recommended intakes of vegetablesfruits and moderate levels of physical activitythe strong protective effect observed suggests a need for additional investigation of the effect of the combined influence of diet and physical activity on breast cancer survival
