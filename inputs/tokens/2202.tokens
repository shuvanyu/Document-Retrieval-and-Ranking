background increased prevalence of allergic diseases in western societies has been described as an epidemicthe precise turning point for the epidemic and the antigens responsible for it remain obscureobjective to evaluate how the prevalence of atopic disease has changed in terms of detectable sensitization to aeroallergens and dietary allergens in a crosssectional comparison of subjects from birth cohorts more than 60 years apartmethods we studied four groups of 100 subjects each at ages 7 27 47 and 67 years representing those born in 1990 196366 194346 and in 192326 respectivelyserum total and specific ige concentrations against aeroallergens and dietary allergens were determineda questionnaire elicited information on symptoms allergic diseases and medicationresults the proportion of subjects with detectable ige antibodies against aeroallergens increased consistently from the oldest to the youngest birth cohorts chi2 trend56809 p00001similar progression was not seen in sensitization to dietary allergensthe proportion of those with diagnosed asthma differed significantly chi21345 p0004 across the birth cohortsthe lowest prevalence of asthma and sensitization to dietary allergens was detected in those born in 194346 ieduring or immediately after world war iiconclusion prevalence of sensitization to airborne allergens unlike that to dietary allergens has increased over a long period of timeour results support the concept of the immune function being programmed by external factors early in lifethey also call for caution when interpretations of the pace and possible causes of the allergy epidemic are made on the basis of shortterm studies
