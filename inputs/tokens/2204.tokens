the most relevant cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis cf patients is the lung pathology characterized by chronic infection and inflammation sustained mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosainnovative pharmacological approaches to control the excessive inflammatory process in the lung of cf patients are thought to be beneficial to reduce the extensive airway tissue damagemedicinal plants from the socalled traditional asian medicine are attracting a growing interest because of their potential efficacy and safetydue to the presence of different active compounds in each plant extract understanding the effect of each component is important to pursue selective and reproducible applicationsextracts from emblica officinalis eo were tested in ib31 cf bronchial epithelial cells exposed to the p aeruginosa laboratory strain pao1eo strongly inhibited the pao1dependent expression of the neutrophil chemokines il8 groalpha grogamma of the adhesion molecule icam1 and of the proinflammatory cytokine il6pyrogallol one of the compounds extracted from eo inhibited the p aeruginosadependent expression of these proinflammatory genes similarly to the whole eo extract whereas a second compound purified from eo namely 5hydroxyisoquinoline had no effectthese results identify pyrogallol as an active compound responsible for the antiinflammatory effect of eo and suggest to extend the investigation in preclinical studies in airway animal models in vivo to test the efficacy and safety of this molecule in cf chronic lung inflammatory disease
