the association of inflammation with modern human diseases egobesity cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes mellitus cancer remains an unsolved mystery of current biology and medicineinflammation is a protective response to noxious stimuli that unavoidably occurs at a cost to normal tissue functionthis fundamental tradeoff between the cost and benefit of the inflammatory response has been optimized over evolutionary time for specific environmental conditionsrapid change of the human environment due to niche construction outpaces genetic adaptation through natural selection leading increasingly to a mismatch between the modern environment and selected traitsconsequently multiple tradeoffs that affect human physiology are not optimized to the modern environment leading to increased disease susceptibilityhere we examine the inflammatory response from an evolutionary perspectivewe discuss unique aspects of the inflammatory response and its evolutionary history that can help explain the association between inflammation and modern human diseases
