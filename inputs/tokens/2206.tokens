autoimmune diseases are complex diseases resulting of the interaction between both genetics and environmental factors over timedifferent phases in the development of autoimmune diseases are characterized by the detection of serum autoantibodies several months or years before the onset of clinical manifestations and subsequent diagnosisin addition to serum antibodies genetic susceptibility factors may predict the future development of the diseasecurrently prediction in type 1 diabetes is the most accurate with the analysis of genetic susceptibility factors in firstdegree relatives of patients and several autoantibody testsin the future multiple antibodies test in combination with the analysis of genetics epigenetics and immunological anomalies in fine models may allow the precise prediction in autoimmune diseasesprevention measures might thus be introduced as an attempt to avoid or delay the diseasecopyright Ã¢ 2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
