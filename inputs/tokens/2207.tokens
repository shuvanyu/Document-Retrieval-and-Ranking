objective secretory immunoglobulin a siga acts as the first line of adaptive humoral immune defense at mucosal surfacesa lack of siga or the inability to produce antigenspecific siga can lead to an increased risk of infectionsdietary intake may improve mucosal immunity by accelerating siga secretionthis study investigated the effect of dietary intake of agaricus bisporus white button mushroom wbm on salivary iga siga secretion in healthy subjectsmethods twentyfour healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a normal daily diet control group or a normal diet with wbmthe subjects in the active group n  12 414  113 y old consumed 100 g of blanched wbm daily with their normal diet for 1 wk whereas those in the control group consumed their normal diet n  12 435  125 y old without wbmsaliva was collected before and after commencement of the study and every week thereafter for 3 wksaliva flow rate siga concentration and osmolality were determined and the sigaosmolality ratio and the siga secretion rate were calculatedresults there was no significant difference between pre and postdietary mushroom intakes for all indices in the control group p  005in contrast the mean siga secretion rate increased significantly at weeks 1 and 2 by 53 and 56 respectively compared with that at week 0 p  00005 in the wbm intake group and then returned to a baseline level at week 3changes in siga secretion rate over the intervention period were greater in the wbm group than in the control group without wbmin both groups no significant changes in osmolality and saliva igg were notedthere was however a significant increase in the sigaosmolality ratio p  00012 confirming the postdietary wbminduced siga increaseconclusion the dietary intake of a bisporus wbm significantly accelerates siga secretion thereby indicating its potential health benefits for improving mucosal immunitycrown copyright  2012published by elsevier inc all rights reserved
