a twostep method was developed to quantitatively assess the infection rate of the entomophthoraceous fungus zoophthora anhuiensis li humber on the green peach aphid myzus persicae sulzerfirstly a standard timedosemortality relationship established by modeling data from bioassay 1 at varying conidial dosages 04  104 conidiamm2 of z anhuiensis f97028 was used to yield an estimate of expected mortality probability at a given dosagesecondly bioassay 2 was conducted by simultaneously exposing six  or  4dayold nymphal colonies to a shower of z anhuiensis conidia at each of four dosages resulting from exposures of 03  80 minsubsequently the colonies were separately immersed in a 01 chlorothalonil solution for 05 min to disinfect all surviving conidia on the host integument from 1  12 h after exposure under temperature treatments of 15 and 20 degrees c respectivelythe infection rate during a specific period from the end of the exposure to the immersion was then estimated as the ratio of the observed mortality over the expected mortality probability at a particular dosagethe results showed that the infection of m persicae from z anhuiensis was highly rapid with little difference between aphid colonies maintained at 15 and 20 degrees c before being immersed in the fungicidal solution after exposurethe first 6hour period after exposure was most crucial to successful infection of the fungus with the infection rate greatly depending on conidial dosagesit took  or  1 h to infect  50 of the aphids at a dosage of  15 conidamm2 and  90 at  50 conidiamm2
