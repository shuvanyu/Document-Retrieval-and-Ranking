background th17 is a subset of thelper lymphocytes that produce proinflammatory cytokines mainly il17serum il17 is increased in allergic patients and relates to clinical severityrecently it has been reported that cd161 is a highly upregulated gene in th17 clones and all il17producing cells are contained in cd161 t cellsthis study aimed at comparing the frequency of peripheral cd161 t cells in patients with allergic rhinitis ar and in healthy controls and at relating cd161 expression with symptom severitymethods fortyfour patients with ar and 29 healthy nonallergic subjects were evaluatedcd161 expression was evaluated on cd3 cd4 and cd8 cells by double immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence activated cell sorter analysissymptom severity was assessed by the visual analogue scaleresults allergic patients showed a significantly higher frequency of cd3cd161 cd4cd161 and cd8cd161 cells than healthy nonallergic subjects p  00001moreover the expression of cd161 cells was significantly related to clinical severityconclusions this study provides evidence that a higher frequency of cd161 t cells is present in the peripheral blood of ar patientscopyright  2012 s karger ag basel
