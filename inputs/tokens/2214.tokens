the present study was conducted to determine differences in antioxidant levels of fresh frozen and freezedried strawberries and strawberry jamhydrophilic antioxidant activity haa and lipophilic antioxidant activity laa were measured using the abtsh₂o₂hrp decoloration methodhaa and laa were then summed to calculate the total antioxidant activity taamean differences in haa and laa were analyzed using oneway analysis of variance and dunnetts t3 pairwise comparisonsthe mean taa for freezedried strawberries based on an as consumed weight 95 confidence interval ci 2958 3058 was significantly higher than for fresh 95 ci 318 366 frozen 95 ci 258 279 and jam 95 ci 110 122the mean taa based on dry weight for fresh strawberries 95 ci 4048 4667 was significantly higher than for freezedried 95 ci 2958 3058 frozen 95 ci 2462 2659 and jam 95 ci 148 164results agree with previous studies reporting that strawberries are a valuable source of antioxidants for consumers
