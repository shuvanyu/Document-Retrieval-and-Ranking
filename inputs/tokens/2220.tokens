black raspberries are a rich natural source of chemopreventive phytochemicalsrecent studies have shown that freezedried black raspberries inhibit the development of oral esophageal and colon cancer in rodents and extracts of black raspberries inhibit benzoapyreneinduced cell transformation of hamster embryo fibroblastshowever the molecular mechanisms and the active components responsible for black raspberry chemoprevention are unclearin this study we found that 2 major chemopreventive components of black raspberries ferulic acid and betasitosterol and a fraction eluted with ethanol roet during silica column chromatography of the organic extract of freezedried black raspberries inhibit the growth of premalignant and malignant but not normal human oral epithelial cell linesanother fraction eluted with ch2cl2ethanol dmet and ellagic acid inhibited the growth of normal as well as premalignant and malignant human oral cell lineswe investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ferulic acid and betasitosterol and the roet fraction selectively inhibited the growth of premalignant and malignant oral cells using flow cytometry and western blotting of cell cycle regulatory proteinsthere was no discernable change in the cell cycle distribution following treatment of cells with the roet fractionpremalignant and malignant cells redistributed to the g2m phase of the cell cycle following incubation with ferulic acidbetasitosterol treated premalignant and malignant cells accumulated in the g0g1 and g2m phases respectivelythe roet fraction reduced the levels of cyclin a and cell division cycle gene 2 cdc2 in premalignant cells and cyclin b1 cyclin d1 and cdc2 in the malignant cell linesthis fraction also elevated the levels of p21waf1cip1 in the malignant cell lineferulic acid treatment led to increased levels of cyclin b1 and cdc2 in both cell lines and p21waf1cip1 was induced in the malignant cell linebetasitosterol reduced the levels of cyclin b1 and cdc2 while increasing p21waf1cip1 in both the premalignant and malignant cell linesthese results show for the first time that the growth inhibitory effects of black raspberries on premalignant and malignant human oral cells may reside in specific components that target aberrant signaling pathways regulating cell cycle progression
