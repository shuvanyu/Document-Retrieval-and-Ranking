epidemiological studies investigating the association between dietary intake and oesophageal cancer have mostly focused on nutrients and food groups instead of dietary patternswe conducted a populationbased casecontrol study which included 365 oesophageal adenocarcinoma oac 426 oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma ogjac and 303 oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma oscc cases with frequency matched on age sex and geographical location to 1580 controlsdata on demographic lifestyle and dietary factors were collected using selfadministered questionnaireswe used principal component analysis to derive three dietary patterns meat and fat pasta and pizza and fruit and vegetable and unconditional logistic regression models to estimate risks of oac ogjac and oscc associated with quartiles q of dietary pattern scoresa high score on the meatandfat pattern was associated with increased risk of all three cancers multivariableadjusted or 212 95  ci 130 346 for oac 188 95 ci 121 294 for ogjac 284 95 ci 167 483 for oscc ptrend 001 for all three cancersa high score on the pastaandpizza pattern was inversely associated with oscc risk or 058 95  ci 036 096 p for trend0009 and a high score on the fruitandvegetable pattern was associated with a borderline significant decreased risk of ogjac or for q4 v q1 066 95 ci 042 104 p007 and significantly decreased risk of oscc or 041 95 ci 024 070 p for trend0002highfat dairy foods appeared to play a dominant role in the association between the meatandfat pattern and risk of oac and ogjacfurther investigation in prospective studies is needed to confirm these findings
