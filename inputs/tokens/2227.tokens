oxidative stress is a key component in linking environmental toxicity to the multistage carcinogenic processreactive oxygen species ros are generated in response to both endogenous and exogenous stimulito counterbalance rosmediated injury an endogenous antioxidants defense system exists however when oxidation exceeds the control mechanisms oxidative stress ariseschronic and cumulative oxidative stress induces deleterious modifications to a variety of macromolecular components such as dna lipids and proteinsa primary mechanism of many chemotherapy drugs against cancer cells is the formation of ros or free radicalsradiotherapy is based on the fact that ionizing radiation destroys tumor cellsradiotherapy induces direct lesions in the dna or biological molecules which eventually affect dnafree radicals produced by oncology therapy are often a source of serious side effects as wellthe objective of this review is to provide information about the effects of antioxidants during oncology treatments and to discuss the possible events and efficacymuch debate has arisen about whether antioxidant supplementation alters the efficacy of cancer chemotherapythere is still limited evidence in both quality and sample size suggesting that certain antioxidant supplements may reduce adverse reactions and toxicitiessignificant reductions in toxicity may alleviate doselimiting toxicities so that more patients are able to complete prescribed chemotherapy regimens and thus in turn improve the potential for success in terms of tumor response and survivalcopyright  2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
