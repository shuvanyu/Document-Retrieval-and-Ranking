dysplasia is a histologic precursor of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma sccwe previously showed that dietary freezedried or lyophilized strawberry powder inhibits nnitrosomethylbenzylamineinduced scc in the rat esophaguson the basis of this observation we conducted a randomized noncomparative phase ii trial in china to investigate the effects of two doses of freezedried strawberries in patients with esophageal dysplastic lesions in a highrisk area for esophageal cancerwe randomly assigned 75 patients identified by endoscopy to have dysplastic esophageal premalignant lesions to receive freezedried strawberry powder at either 30 gd 37 patients or 60 gd 38 patients for six months the powder was mixed with water and drunkafter six months we assessed the changes in histologic grade of these lesions primary endpoint in a blinded fashionthe dose of 30 gd did not significantly affect histology or any other measured parameterthe dose of 60 gd however reduced the histologic grade of dysplastic premalignant lesions in 29 806 of the 36 patients at this dose who were evaluated for histology p  00001the strawberry powder was well tolerated with no toxic effects or serious adverse eventsstrawberries 60 gd also reduced protein expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase inos by 795 p  0001 cyclooxygenase2 cox2 by 629 p  0001 phosphonuclear factor kappa b nfκbp65 pnfκbp65 by 626 p  0001 and phosphos6 ps6 by 732 p  0001freezedried strawberries 60 gd also significantly inhibited the ki67 labeling index by 379 p  0023our present results indicate the potential of freezedried strawberry powder for preventing human esophageal cancer supporting further clinical testing of this natural agent in this setting2011 aacr
