this study assessed the metabolic response to sweetened dried cranberries sdc raw cranberries rc and white bread wb in humans with type 2 diabetesdevelopment of palatable cranberry preparations associated with lower glycemic responses may be useful for improving fruit consumption and glycemic control among those with diabetesin this trial type 2 diabetics n 13 received wb 57 g 160 cal 1 g fiber rc 55 g 21 cal 1 g fiber sdc 40 g 138 cal 21 g fiber and sdc containing less sugar sdcls 40 g 113 cal 18 g fiber  10 g polydextroseplasma glucose mmoll peaked significantly at 60 min for wb and at 30 min for rc sdc and sdcls at 96  04 70  04 96  05 and 87  05 respectively wb remained significantly elevated from the other treatments at 120 minplasma insulin pmolml peaked at 60 min for wb and sdc and at 30 min for rc and sdcls at 157  15 142  27 61  8 and 97  11 respectivelyplasma insulin for sdcls was significantly lower at 60 min than either wb or sdcinsulin area under the curve auc values for rc and sdcls were both significantly lower than wb or sdcphenolic content of sdc and sdcls was determined following extraction with 80 acetone prior to highperformance liquid chromatography hplc and electronspray ionizationmass spectrometry esims and found to be rich in 5caffeoylquinic cid quercetin3galactoside and quercetin3galactoside and the proanthocyanidin dimer epicatechinin conclusion sdcls was associated with a favorable glycemic and insulinemic response in type 2 diabeticspractical application this study compares phenolic content and glycemic responses among different cranberry productsthe study seeks to expand the palatable and portable healthy food choices for persons with type 2 diabetesthe novel use of polydextrose as a bulking agent making possible a reduction in caloric content and potential glycemic response is also characterized in this study
