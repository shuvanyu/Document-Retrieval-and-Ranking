background dietary flavonoids have beneficial effects on blood pressure in intervention settings but there is limited information on habitual intake and risk of hypertension in populationbased studiesobjective we examined the association between habitual flavonoid intake and incident hypertension in a prospective study in men and womendesign a total of 87242 women from the nurses health study nhs ii 46672 women from the nhs i and 23043 men from the health professionals followup study hpfs participated in the studytotal flavonoid and subclass intakes were calculated from semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaires collected every 4 y by using an updated and extended us department of agriculture databaseresults during 14 y of followup 29018 cases of hypertension in women and 5629 cases of hypertension in men were reportedin pooled multivariateadjusted analyses participants in the highest quintile of anthocyanin intake predominantly from blueberries and strawberries had an 8 reduction in risk of hypertension relative risk rr 092 95 ci 086 098 p  003 compared with that for participants in the lowest quintile of anthocyanin intake the risk reduction was 12 rr 088 95 ci 084 093 p  0001 in participants 60 y of age and 096 091 102 in participants 60 y of age p for age interaction  002although intakes of other subclasses were not associated with hypertension pooled analyses for individual compounds suggested a 5 95 ci 091 099 p  0005 reduction in risk for the highest compared with the lowest quintiles of intake of the flavone apigeninin participants 60 y of age a 6 95 ci 088 097 p  0002 reduction in risk was observed for the flavan3ol catechin when the highest and the lowest quintiles were comparedconclusions anthocyanins and some flavone and flavan3ol compounds may contribute to the prevention of hypertensionthese vasodilatory properties may result from specific structural similarities including the bring hydroxylation and methyoxylation pattern
