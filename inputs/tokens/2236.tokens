consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancerphytochemicals especially phenolics in fruits and vegetables are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds for the health benefitshowever the phenolic contents and their antioxidant activities in fruits and vegetables were underestimated in the literature because bound phenolics were not includedthis study was designed to investigate the profiles of total phenolics including both soluble free and bound forms in common fruits by applying solvent extraction base digestion and solidphase extraction methodscranberry had the highest total phenolic content followed by apple red grape strawberry pineapple banana peach lemon orange pear and grapefruittotal antioxidant activity was measured using the tosc assaycranberry had the highest total antioxidant activity 1770  43 micromol of vitamin c equivg of fruit followed by apple red grape strawberry peach lemon pear banana orange grapefruit and pineappleantiproliferation activities were also studied in vitro using hepg2 human livercancer cells and cranberry showed the highest inhibitory effect with an ec50 of 145  05 mgml followed by lemon apple strawberry red grape banana grapefruit and peacha bioactivity index bi for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion
