research suggests that anthocyanins from berry fruit may affect a variety of physiological responses including endothelial function but little information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of these flavonoids in humansto determine the pharmacokinetics of cranberry anthocyanins a study was undertaken in 15 participants age 62  8 y with coronary artery diseaseblood and urine samples were collected between baseline 0 h and 4 h after consumption of 480 ml cranberry juice 54 juice 835 mg total polyphenols 9447 mg anthocyaninsmarked interindividual differences in plasma anthocyanin pharmacokinetics were observed with maximum anthocyanin concentrations detected between 1 and 3 h cranberry anthocyanins were bioavailable but with notable differences in the maximum concentration and area under the curve04h between individual participantsthe pattern of anthocyanin glucosides observed in plasma and urine generally reflected the relative concentration determined in the juiceplasma concentrations of the individual anthocyanins ranged between 056 and 464 nmolltotal recovery of urinary anthocyanin was 079  090 of the dose deliveredthese data are in agreement with the pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins from other foods suggesting that cranberry anthocyanins are poorly absorbed and rapidly removed from plasmaobserved concentrations of plasma anthocyanins appear insufficient to alter radical load or redox potential but may be adequate to affect signal transduction andor gene expression
