pressures in the superficial leg veins of 24 patients with varicose veins and 6 normal controls were studiedin the controls there was no rise in pressure in the veins on increasing the intraabdominal pressure but in the patients with varicose veins pressure rose significantlysquatting was no better than sitting in preventing transmission of intraabdominal pressure to the leg veinsit was concluded that the difference in the positions adopted for defaecation is not the cause of the wide variation in the geographical distribution of varicose veins
