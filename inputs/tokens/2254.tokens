the aim of this study was to explore oral exposure to carcinogenic group 1 acetaldehyde after single sips of strong alcoholic beverages containing no or high concentrations of acetaldehydeeight volunteers tasted 5 ml of ethanol diluted to 40 vol with no acetaldehyde and 40 vol calvados containing 2400 μm acetaldehydesalivary acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations were measured by gas chromatographythe protocol was repeated after ingestion of ethanol 05 gkg body weightsalivary acetaldehyde concentration was significantly higher after sipping calvados than after sipping ethanol at 30s both with 215 vs 128 μmoll p005 and without 258 vs 89 μmoll p005 alcohol ingestionfrom 2 min onwards there were no significant differences in the decreasing salivary acetaldehyde concentration which remained above the level of carcinogenicity still at 10 minthe systemic alcohol distribution from blood to saliva had no additional effect on salivary acetaldehyde after sipping of the alcoholic beveragescarcinogenic concentrations of acetaldehyde are produced from ethanol in the oral cavity instantly after a small sip of strong alcoholic beverage and the exposure continues for at least 10 minacetaldehyde present in the beverage has a shortterm effect on total acetaldehyde exposurecopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
