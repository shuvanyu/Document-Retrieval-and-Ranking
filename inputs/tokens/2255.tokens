increasing evidence suggests that acetaldehyde the first and genotoxic metabolite of ethanol mediates the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beveragesethanol is also contained in a number of readytouse mouthwashes typically between 5 and 27 volan increased risk of oral cancer has been discussed for users of such mouthwashes however epidemiological evidence had remained inconclusivethis study is the first to investigate acetaldehyde levels in saliva after use of alcoholcontaining mouthwashesreadytouse mouthwashes and mouthrinses n  13 were rinsed in the mouth by healthy nonsmoking volunteers n  4 as intended by the manufacturers 20 ml for 30 secsaliva was collected at 05 2 5 and 10 min after mouthwash use and analyzed using headspace gas chromatographythe acetaldehyde content in the saliva was 41  15 microm range 985 microm 05 min 52  14 microm range 11105 microm 2 min 32  7 microm range 967 microm 5 min and 15  7 microm range 037 microm 10 minthe contents were significantly above endogenous levels and corresponding to concentrations normally found after alcoholic beverage consumptiona twicedaily use of alcoholcontaining mouthwashes leads to a systemic acetaldehyde exposure of 026 microgkg bodyweightday on average which corresponds to a lifetime cancer risk of 3e6the margin of exposure was calculated to be 217604 which would be seen as a low public health concernhowever the local acetaldehyde contents in the saliva are reaching concentrations associated with dna adduct formation and sister chromatid exchange in vitro so that concerns for local carcinogenic effects in the oral cavity remain
