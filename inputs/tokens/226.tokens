the present studies explored whether faecal retention in the colon is a causative factor in functional bowel disease appendicitis and haemorrhoidsfaecal retention was characterized by colon transit time ctt after radioopaque marker ingestion and estimation of faecal loading on abdominal radiographs at 48 h and 96 h specific hypotheses were tested in patients n  251 plus 281 and in healthy random controls n  44a questionnaire was completed for each patient covering abdominal and anorectal symptoms and without a priori groupingpatients with functional bowel disorders predominantly women had a significantly increased ctt and faecal load compared to controlsthe ctt was significantly and positively correlated with segmental and total faecal loadingthe faecal load was equal at 48 h and 96 h mirroring the presence of permanent faecal reservoirsin these first clinical studies to correlate bowel symptoms with ctt and colon faecal loading abdominal bloating was significantly correlated with faecal loading in the right colon total faecal load and cttabdominal pain was significantly and positively correlated to distal faecal loading and significantly associated with bloatinga new phenomenon with a high faecal load and a normal ctt was observed in a subset of patients n  90 proving faecal retention as hidden constipationthe ctt and faecal load were significantly higher in the rightside compared to the left and distal segmentswithin the control group of healthy persons the rightsided faecal load was significantly greater than the left and distal loadthe ctt and faecal load significantly positively correlated with a palpable mass in the left iliac fossa and meteorismcluster analysis revealed that ctt and faecal load positively correlated with a symptom factor consisting of bloating proctalgia and infrequent defecation of solid faeceson the other hand ctt and faecal load negatively correlated with a symptom factor comprising frequent easy defecations repetitiveness and incompleteness with solid or liquid faecesthe majority of patients with a heavy faecal load but normal ctt had repetitive daily defecation mostly with ease and with altering faecal consistencefluelike episodes coexisted in symptom factors with abdominal pain and meteorism and these symptoms together with a palpable right iliac fossa mass and tenderness and in other factors with seldom and difficult defecation and with epigastric discomfort and halitosispatients with seldom and difficult defecation of solid faeces experienced abdominal pain significantly more often and presented a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa with tenderness and meteorismthe ctt was significantly prolonged and faecal load significantly increasedin patients with a normal ctt and increased faecal load only patients with abdominal pain had a significant correlation between faecal loading and bloatingctt and faecal load were shown for the first time to increase significantly with the number of colonic redundancies colon length which also resulted in significantly increased bloating and painintervention with a bowel stimulation regimen combining a fibrerich diet fluid physical activity and a prokinetic drug was essential to proving that abdominal symptoms and defecation disorders are caused by faecal retention with or without a prolonged cttthe ctt was significantly reduced as was faecal loadbloating and pain were reduced significantlythe defecation became easy with solid faeces towards one per day and with significant reductions in incompleteness and repetitivenessproctalgia and fluelike episodes were significantly reducedthe intervention significantly reduced the presence of a tender palpable mass in the right fossa and rectal constipationin patients with a normal ctt but increased faecal load the intervention did not significantly change the ctt or load but bloating and pain were significantly reduced just as defecation improved overallthe novel knowledge of faecal retention in the patients does not explain why faecal retention occurshowever it may be inferred from the present results that a constipated or irritable bowel may belong to the same underlying disease dimension where faecal retention is a common factorthus measuring ctt and faecal load is suggested as a guide to a positive functional diagnosis of bowel disorders compared to the constellation of symptoms alonethirtyfive patients underwent surgery after being refractory to the conservative treatment for constipationthey had a significantly prolonged ctt and heavy faecal loading which was responsible for the aggravated abdominal and defaecatory symptomsthe operated patients presented with a redundant colon dolichocolon significantly more oftenthese patients also had an extremely high rate of previous appendectomytwentyone patients underwent hemicolectomy and 11 patients had a subtotal colectomy with an ileosigmoidal anastomosis three patients received a stomahowever some patients had to have the initial segmental colectomy converted to a final subtotal colectomy because of persisting symptomssix more subtotal colectomies have been performed and the leakage rate of all colectomies is then 49  one patient diedafter a mean followup of 5 years the vast majority of patients were without abdominal pain and bloating having two to four defecations daily with control and their quality of life had increased considerablya faecalith is often located in the appendix the occlusion of which is responsible for many cases of acute appendicitis which is infrequent in all except white populationsan effort to trace the origin of the faecalith to faecal retention in the colon was made in a case control study 56 patients and 44 random controlsthe ctt was longer and faecal load greater in patients with appendicitis compared to controls though the difference was not significantpower calculations showed that more patients were needed to reach statistical significance for these parametersthe presence of a faecalith was most often associated with a gangrenous or perforated appendixno significant differences were found between the ctt and faecal load of patients who had or did not have a faecalithhowever the rightsided faecal load was significantly higher than the left and distal loadhaemorrhoids are often a consequence of constipation and defaecatory disorders and were found in every second patient with functional bowel disordersthe present studies are the first danish reports of a novel operation to cure this disease stapled haemorrhoidopexy n  40 and 258 patientsthe majority of patients had prolapsed haemorrhoids and the durability of procedure was confirmed with a followup of up to 5 years meaning a normal anusthe operation time was short postoperative pain was low and recovery was rapidno incontinence was observed and patient satisfaction was high and significantly correlated with the appearance of a normal anus without prolapsethe cumulative risk of reoperation was greatest in the first 2 years after the stapled haemorrhoidopexypatients with persisting haemorrhoidal prolapse had the procedure repeated with results as good as those obtained in the rest of the patientsit was shown in a statistical model that the preoperative severity of haemorrhoidal disease and the immediate postoperative result contributed significantly to predicting the outcome that is the durability of the operationthe most frequent postoperative complication was bleeding requiring surgical haemostasisone serious complication occurred after an anastomotic leak from a highly placed anastomosis resulting in retro rectal retro and intraperitoneal and mediastinal gasthe patient recovered after conservative treatment and without surgical interventionthe stapling technique now used has revolutionized the surgical treatment of prolapsing haemorrhoidsfinally a common cause may be suspected for diseases constantly associated with one anotherepidemiological evidence has recognized that constipation diverticulosis and ibs increase the risk of colon cancer and adenomas diseases exceedingly rare in communities exempt from appendicitishaemorrhoids are a colonic comorbidity as wellnotably the patients with a functional bowel disorder had a much higher rate of a previous appendectomy than the background populationin addition the patients who had previously had an appendectomy had a significantly longer ctt compared to patients who had notthe data points to the involvement of faecal retention in the origin of faecaliths and thus acute appendicitisfaecal reservoirs were shown in the right and left colon segments in both patients and controls which are the same areas bearing the highest incidences of adenomateous polyps and malignanciesfamilial colorectal cancer occurred significantly more often in patients who had a higher faecal load than the controlsfour malignancies and 25 adenomas were identifiedan increased faecal load in the colon with or without delayed transit will increase bacterial counts and create a chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa which is a risk factor for cancer onseta functional bowel disorder is then likely to occur with gradually transition from a primary functional disease into specific organic diseasesa diet rich in fibre and regular physical activity have a therapeutic and preventive effect on colorectal diseases associated with faecal retention
