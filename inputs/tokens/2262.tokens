objective hyperosmotic stress on cells limits many aspects of cell function metabolism and healthinternational data suggest that schoolchildren may be at risk of hyperosmotic stress on cells because of suboptimal water intakethe present study explored the cell hydration status of two samples of children in the usadesign crosssectional study describing the urine osmolality an index of hyperosmotic cell shrinkage and water intake of convenience samples from los angeles la and new york city nycsetting each participant collected a urine sample at an outpatient clinic on the way to school on a weekday morning in spring 2009each was instructed to wake eat drink and do as usual before school and complete a dietary record form describing the type and amounts of all foods and beverages consumed after waking before giving the samplesubjects the children 911 years in la n 337 and nyc n 211 considered themselves healthy enough to go to school on the day they gave the urine sampleresults elevated urine osmolality 800 mmolkg was observed in 63  and 66  of participants in la and nyc respectivelyin multivariableadjusted logistic regression models elevated urine osmolality was associated with not reporting intake of drinking water in the morning la or  21 95  ci 12 35 nyc or  18 95  ci 10 35although over 90  of both samples had breakfast before giving the urine sample 75  did not drink waterconclusions research is warranted to confirm these results and pursue their potential health implications
