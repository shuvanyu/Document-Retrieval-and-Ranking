the question of whether menstrual disturbances are more common in vegetarian than in nonvegetarian women is complexdisturbances of the cycle may be clinical ie amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea or subclinical ie normallength cycles with anovulation or a short or defective luteal phasedetection of the latter requires that the menstrual cycle be monitored but may help prevent recruitment bias in studies comparing vegetarians with nonvegetarians because vegetarians with menstrual disturbances may be more likely to volunteer for a study on menstrual disturbances and vegetarianismthree general mechanisms that could contribute to menstrual disturbances that may differ between vegetarians and nonvegetarians include energy imbalances associated with bodyweight disturbances or exercise psychosocial and cognitive factors and dietary componentsevidence for each of these mechanisms is reviewed and studies comparing menstrual function between vegetarians and nonvegetarians are described in this articlealthough results from several crosssectional studies suggest that clinical menstrual disturbances may be more common in vegetarians a prospective study that controlled for many potential confounders found that subclinical disturbances were less common in weightstable healthy vegetarian womenbecause the sample studied may not be representative of all vegetarian women however these results cannot be generalizedpopulation studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions
