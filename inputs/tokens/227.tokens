the aim of the study was to compare the straining forces applied when sitting or squatting during defecationtwentyeight apparently healthy volunteers ages 1766 years with normal bowel function were asked to use a digital timer to record the net time needed for sensation of satisfactory emptying while defecating in three alternative positions sitting on a standardsized toilet seat 4142 cm high sitting on a lower toilet seat 3132 cm high and squattingthey were also asked to note their subjective impression of the intensity of the defecation effortsix consecutive bowel movements were recorded in each positionboth the time needed for sensation of satisfactory bowel emptying and the degree of subjectively assessed straining in the squatting position were reduced sharply in all volunteers compared with both sitting positions p  00001in conclusion the present study confirmed that sensation of satisfactory bowel emptying in sitting defecation posture necessitates excessive expulsive effort compared to the squatting posture
