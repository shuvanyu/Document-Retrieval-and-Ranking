in this study a panel of normal human prostate cells hpcs and tumor cells derived from metastases were studied by 1h nmr spectroscopy to determine whether the malignant transformation of hpcs results in the elevation of choline compoundsalthough an elevated choline signal has been observed previously in clinical studies the contribution of the different cho compounds to this elevation as well as their quantification has not been established until nowhere we have shown that hpcs derived from metastases exhibit significantly higher phosphocholine as well as glycerophosphocholine levels compared with normal prostate epithelial and stromal cellsthus the elevation of the choline peak observed clinically in prostate cancer is attributable to an alteration of phospholipid metabolism and not simply to increased cell density doubling time or other nonspecific effectsandrogen deprivation of the androgen receptorpositive cell lines resulted in a significant increase of choline compounds after chronic androgen deprivation of the lncap cell line and in a decrease of choline compounds after a more acute androgen deprivation of the lapc4 cell linethese data strongly support the use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging to detect the presence of prostate cancer for diagnosis to detect response subsequent to androgen ablation therapy and to detect recurrence
