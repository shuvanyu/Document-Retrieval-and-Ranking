red and processed meat may increase risk of advanced prostate cancerdata on postdiagnostic diet and prostate cancer are sparse but postdiagnostic intake of poultry with skin and eggs may increase risk of disease progressiontherefore we prospectively examined total unprocessed and processed red meat poultry and eggs in relation to risk of lethal prostate cancer egmen without cancer at baseline who developed distant organ metastases or died from prostate cancer during followup among 27 607 men followed from 19942008we also performed a caseonly survival analysis to examine postdiagnostic consumption of these foods and risk of lethal prostate cancer among the 3127 men initially diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer during followupin the incidence analysis we observed 199 events during 306715 personyearsmen who consumed 25 or more eggs per week had an 81 increased risk of lethal prostate cancer compared to men who consumed less than 05 eggs per week hr 181 95 confidence interval ci 113 289 ptrend 001in the caseonly survival analysis we observed 123 events during 19354 personyearsthere were suggestive but not statistically significant positive associations between postdiagnostic poultry hr 35 vs 15 servings per week 169 95ci 096 299 ptrend 007 and postdiagnostic processed red meat hr 3 vs 05 servings per week 145 95ci 073 287 ptrend 008 and risk of progression of localized prostate cancer to lethal diseasein conclusion consumption of eggs may increase risk of developing a lethalform of prostate cancer among healthy men
