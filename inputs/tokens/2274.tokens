dietary choline and betaine have been hypothesized to decrease the risk of cancer because of their role as methyl donors in the onecarbon metabolismhowever it remains unknown whether dietary intake of choline and betaine is associated with colorectal cancer riskwe prospectively examined the associations between dietary choline and betaine intake and risk of colorectal cancer in men in the health professionals followup studywe followed 47302 men and identified a total of 987 incident colorectal cancer cases from 1986 to 2004we assessed dietary and supplemental choline and betaine intake every four years using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnairethe cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate multivariate relative risks rrs and 95 confidence intervals 95 cisall statistical tests were twosidedwe did not find any statistically significant associations between choline intake or betaine intake and risk of colorectal cancercomparing the top quintile with bottom quintile multivariate rrs 95 ci were 097 079120 ptrend  087 for choline intake and 094 077116 ptrend  079 for betaine intakesimilarly we observed no associations between colorectal cancer risk and choline from free choline glycerophosphocholine phosphocholine phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelinour data do not support that choline and betaine intake is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk
