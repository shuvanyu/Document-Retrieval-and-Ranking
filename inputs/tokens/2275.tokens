purpose components of onecarbon metabolism are believed to influence cancer development with suggested mechanisms including dna methylation and dna repair mechanismshowever few prospective studies have investigated onecarbon metabolism in relation to prostate cancer risk and the results have been conflictingthe aim of this study was to do a comprehensive investigation of the components of onecarbon metabolism in relation to prostate cancer riska panel of seven circulating b vitamins and related metabolites was selected most of which have not been studied beforematerials and methods we analyzed plasma concentrations of betaine choline cysteine methionine methylmalonic acid mma vitamin b2 and vitamin b6 in 561 cases and 1034 controls matched for age and recruitment date nested within the populationbased northern sweden health and disease cohortrelative risks of prostate cancer were estimated by conditional logistic regressionresults positive associations with prostate cancer risk were observed for choline and vitamin b2 and an inverse association was observed for mmathe relative risks for a doubling in concentrations were 146 95 confidence interval 95 ci 104205 ptrend  003 for choline 111 95 ci 100123 ptrend  004 for vitamin b2 and 078 95 ci 063097 ptrend  003 for mmaconcentrations of betaine cysteine methionine and vitamin b6 were not associated with prostate cancer riskconclusion the results of this large prospective study suggest that elevated plasma concentrations of choline and vitamin b2 may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancerthese novel findings support a role of onecarbon metabolism in prostate cancer etiology and warrant further investigation
