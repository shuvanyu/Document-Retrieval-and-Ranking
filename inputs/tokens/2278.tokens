intestinal microbiota metabolism of cholinephosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine tma which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species trimethylaminenoxide tmaoherein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary lcarnitine a trimethylamine abundant in red meat also produces tmao and accelerates atherosclerosisomnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more tmao than vegansvegetarians following ingestion of lcarnitine through a microbiotadependent mechanismspecific bacterial taxa in human feces are shown to associate with both plasma tmao and dietary statusplasma lcarnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation n  2595 predict increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease cvd and incident major adverse cardiac events mi stroke or death but only among subjects with concurrently high tmao levelschronic dietary lcarnitine supplementation in mice significantly altered cecal microbial composition markedly enhanced synthesis of tmatmao and increased atherosclerosis but not following suppression of intestinal microbiotadietary supplementation of tmao or either carnitine or choline in mice with intact intestinal microbiota significantly reduced reverse cholesterol transport in vivointestinal microbiota may thus participate in the wellestablished link between increased red meat consumption and cvd risk
