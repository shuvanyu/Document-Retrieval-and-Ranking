background processed meat and fish have been shown to be associated with the risk of advanced prostate cancer but few studies have examined diet after prostate cancer diagnosis and risk of its progressionobjective we examined the association between postdiagnostic consumption of processed and unprocessed red meat fish poultry and eggs and the risk of prostate cancer recurrence or progressiondesign we conducted a prospective study in 1294 men with prostate cancer without recurrence or progression as of 20042005 who were participating in the cancer of the prostate strategic urologic research endeavor and who were followed for an average of 2 yresults we observed 127 events prostate cancer death or metastases elevated prostatespecific antigen concentration or secondary treatment during 2610 personyearsintakes of processed and unprocessed red meat fish total poultry and skinless poultry were not associated with prostate cancer recurrence or progressiongreater consumption of eggs and poultry with skin was associated with 2fold increases in risk in a comparison of extreme quantiles eggs hazard ratio hr 202 95 ci 110 372 p for trend  005 and poultry with skin hr 226 95 ci 136 376 p for trend  0003an interaction was observed between prognostic risk at diagnosis and poultrymen with high prognostic risk and a high poultry intake had a 4fold increased risk of recurrence or progression compared with men with lowintermediate prognostic risk and a low poultry intake p for interaction  0003conclusions our results suggest that the postdiagnostic consumption of processed or unprocessed red meat fish or skinless poultry is not associated with prostate cancer recurrence or progression whereas consumption of eggs and poultry with skin may increase the risk
