basal serum prolactin and serum oestradiol17beta concentrations were measured four times during one menstrual cycle in 20 women with severe cyclical mastalgia and normal to slightly fibroadenotic breastsa group of 10 normal women who had never experienced mastalgia served as controlsbasal serum prolactin was significantly elevated in patients compared to normals although within the normal rangeserum oestradiol concentrations did not differ in the two groups and were also within the normal rangea significant positive correlation between oestradiol and prolactin was found in patients and normals but with larger prolactin levels in patientsthe results point towards a prolactin secretory hypersensitivity for oestradiol in patients with cyclical mastalgiaprolactin is considered a central factor in the eliciting of cyclical mastalgia
