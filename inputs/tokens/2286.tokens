lignans are a group of phytochemicals shown to have weakly estrogenic and antiestrogenic propertiestwo specific lignans enterodiol and enterolactone are absorbed after formation in the intestinal tract from plant precursors particularly abundant in fiberrich food and are excreted in the urinewe evaluated the effect of the ingestion of flax seed powder known to produce high concentrations of urinary lignans on the menstrual cycle in 18 normally cycling women using a balanced randomized crossover designeach subject consumed her usual omnivorous low fiber control diet for 3 cycles and her usual diet supplemented with flax seed for another 3 cyclesthe second and third flax cycles were compared to the second and third control cyclesthree anovulatory cycles occurred during the 36 control cycles compared to none during the 36 flax seed cyclescompared to the ovulatory control cycles the ovulatory flax cycles were consistently associated with longer luteal phase lp lengths mean  sem 126  04 vs 114  04 days p  0002there were no significant differences between flax and control cycles for concentrations of either estradiol or estrone during the early follicular phase midfollicular phase or lpalthough flax seed ingestion had no significant effect on lp progesterone concentrations the lp progesteroneestradiol ratios were significantly higher during the flax cyclesmidfollicular phase testosterone concentrations were slightly higher during flax cyclesflax seed ingestion had no effect on early follicular phase concentrations of dheas prl or sex hormonebinding globulinour data suggest a significant specific role for lignans in the relationship between diet and sex steroid action and possibly between diet and the risk of breast and other hormonally dependent cancers
