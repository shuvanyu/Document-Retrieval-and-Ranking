modifiable factors including diet might alter breast cancer riskwe used the whi dietary modification dm trial to test the effect of the intervention on risk of benign proliferative breast disease a condition associated with increased risk of and considered to be on the pathway to invasive breast cancerthe whi dm trial was a randomized controlled primary prevention trial conducted in 40 us clinical centers from 1993200548835 postmenopausal women aged 5079 years without prior breast cancer were enrolledparticipants were randomly assigned to the dm intervention group or to the comparison groupthe intervention was designed to reduce total dietary fat intake to 20 of total energy intake and to increase fruit and vegetable intake to 5 servingsday and intake of grain products to 6 servingsday but resulted in smaller albeit significant changes in practiceparticipants had biennial mammograms and regular clinical breast examswe identified women who reported breast biopsies free of cancer obtained the histologic sections and subjected them to standardized central reviewduring followup average 77 years 570 incident cases of benign proliferative breast disease were ascertained in the intervention group and 793 in the comparison groupthe hazard ratio for the association between dm and benign proliferative breast disease was 109 95ci 098123risk varied by levels of baseline total vitamin d intake but it varied little by levels of other baseline variablesthese results suggest that a modest reduction in fat intake and increase in fruit vegetable and grain intake does not alter the risk of benign proliferative breast disease
