primary simple constipation is a consequence of habitual bowel elimination on common toilet seatsa considerable proportion of the population with normal bowel movement frequency has difficulty emptying their bowels the principal cause of which is the obstructive nature of the rectoanal angle and its association with the sitting posture normally used in defecationthe only natural defecation posture for a human being is squattingthe alignment of the rectoanal angle associated with squatting permits smooth bowel eliminationthis prevents excessive straining with the potential for resultant damage to the rectoanal region and possibly to the colon and other organsthere is no evidence that habitual bowel elimination at a given time each day contributes considerably to the final act of rectal emptyingthe natural behavior to empty the bowels in response to a strong defecation reflex alleviates bowel emptying by means of the recto anal inhibitory reflex
