methylchavicol ch3cv an important aromatic constituent of different plants like tarragon and basils has been shown to be carcinogenic by a mechanism yet unclear although it has been reported that carcinogenicity of ch3cv in rodent might be linked to its metabolic conversion into a genotoxic electrophilic metabolite generated through a two steps bioactivation pathway catalyzed by cytochrome p450 enzymes and sulfotransferasesthe induction of carcinogenesis by certain agents has been associated with the generation of oxidative stressthe aim of the present study was to determine whether pure methylchavicol applied on a human hepatoma cell line hepg2 could promote oxidative stress and might alter the expression of procarcinogenic biomarkers such as the drugmetabolizing enzyme cyp2e1 the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase inos and might induce the expression of cuznsuperoxide dismutase cuznsod and mnsod that control the redox equilibrium of the cellsch3cv was shown to cause a significant induction of oxidative stress as revealed by luminoldependent chemiluminescence ldcl and to alter dramatically the expression of cyp2e1 inos and mnsod indicating that the toxic effect of ch3cv could be mediated through a nitric oxide dependent mechanismunder similar experimental conditions the extracts from tarragon chervil and basil did not induce such biological changesthese results provide evidence that the generation of an oxidative stress may be a significant event occurring during ch3cvinduced toxicityit also suggests that natural extracts containing different amounts of ch3cv tarragon chervil and basil did not elicit such toxicity and might contain compounds able to counteract this detrimental propertycopyright  2012published by elsevier masson sas
