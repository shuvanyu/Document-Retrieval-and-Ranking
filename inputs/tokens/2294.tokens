artemisia dracunculus l tarragon has a long history of use as a spice and remedytwo welldescribed cultivars russian and french are used widely and differ in ploidy level morphology and chemistrykey biologically active secondary metabolites are essential oils 01531 coumarins 1 flavonoids and phenolcarbonic acidsin vivo studies mainly in rodents particularly from russian sources highlight potential antiinflammatory hepatoprotective and antihyperglycemic effectsdespite concerns about the toxic effects of two of its main constituents estragole up to 82 and methyleugenol up to 39 no acute toxicity or mutagenic activity has been reported at doses relevant for human consumptionwater extracts of a dracunculus contain very low amounts of estragole and methyleugenol and therefore are considered to pose a very limited riskoverall a stronger focus on clinical studies and precise taxonomic and phytochemical definition of the source material will be essential for future research efforts
