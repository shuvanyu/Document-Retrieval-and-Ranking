methylchavicol or estragole a natural flavouring substance present in tarragon was confirmed as a genotoxic chemical in the in vitro uds test in cultured rat hepatocytes and in the in vivo uds test in hepatocytes of exposed ratsdeepfrozen tarragon was clearly less genotoxic than methylchavicol at equivalent dose levels and desiccated tarragon was negativeboth forms of tarragon tested in vitro have the ability to decrease significantly the genotoxicity of methylchavicol added to the culture medium at concentrations 10 mum for deepfrozen and 55 mum for desiccated tarragonthe decrease may be attributed to antimutagenic properties of tarragon leaves andor to adsorption of methylchavicol which would decrease its bioavailabilitydesiccated tarragon powder was not genotoxic in the in vivo uds test when administered up to the maximum dose of 625 gkg bw 1875 mgkg bw of methylchavicolin vivo desiccated tarragon did not show antimutagenic properties because it did not decrease the genotoxicity of methylchavicol added at high concentrationsconsidering the low exposure level at the maximum daily tarragon consumption the rapid detoxification and excretion in humans and the nogenotoxiceffectlevel of methylchavicol by the oral route when given to rats as tarragon leaves a high margin of exposure existswe can conclude that tarragon consumption presents no genotoxic risk to humanscopyright  2009 elsevier bv all rights reserved
