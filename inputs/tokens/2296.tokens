mutagenicity and liver toxicity of the herb tarragon artemisia dracunculus were evaluated using single cell gel comet electrophoresisten microlitres aliquots of peripheral venous human blood were incubated with tarragon extract saline or the mutagen sodium dichromatecell suspensions dispersed in lowmelting agarose were electrophoresed in ethidium bromidethe resulting dna migration trails were obtained using fluorescent microscopy at 400 magnification and graded according to the mutagenicity index mi for each cell incubation conditionthe in vivo liver toxicity of artemisia dracunculus was assessed in the blood of mice treated orally with the extract of the herb using alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast as liver function indicatorsliver morphology was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin he staining of liver tissuethe present study demonstrated a direct correlation between tarragon extract dosage and three major outcome variables mi serum liver enzyme activity and liver histopathologythese outcomes are possibly due to the presence in tarragon of methylchavicol and other genotoxic compoundsthese findings provide a preliminary guide for risk assessment of tarragon in diet and in possible therapeutic applicationscopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
