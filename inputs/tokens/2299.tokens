aims various spices display insulinpotentiating activity in vitro and in particular cinnamon spice and its phenolic extracts have been shown to exhibit these capabilitiesin vivo study shows that cinnamon may have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis therefore the aim of this study was to further investigate this phenomenon in humansmethods seven lean healthy male volunteers aged 26  1 years body mass index 245  03 kgm2 mean  sem underwent three oral glucose tolerance tests ogtt supplemented with either a 5 g placebo ogttcontrol 5 g of cinnamon ogttcin or 5 g of cinnamon taken 12 h before ogttcin12hpre in a randomizedcrossover designresults cinnamon ingestion reduced total plasma glucose responses auc to oral glucose ingestion 13 and 10 for ogttcin p  005 and ogttcin12hpre p  005 respectively as well as improving insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin sensitivity index measures based on matsudas model in both ogttcin p  005 and ogttcin12hpre p  005 trials compared with ogttcontrolconclusions these data illustrate that cinnamon spice supplementation may be important to in vivo glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in humans and not only are its effects immediate they also appear to be sustained for 12 h
