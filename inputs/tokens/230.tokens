to our knowledge there is no previous clinical description in the literature of patients with defecation syncopewe evaluated 20 patients with this disorder who were a subgroup of a larger prospective study of syncope 13 women and seven men with a mean age of 59 yearseleven patients had had one episode and nine had experienced multiple episodesfourteen patients were recumbent before the urge to defecate nine of these asleepthe diagnostic evaluation disclosed that two patients had gastrointestinal tract problems three had cardiac diseases and one had transient ischemic attacksthree additional patients had marked orthostatic hypotensionno identifiable cause for defecation syncope was found in 11 patients but new medical problems were noted in four of those patientsin followup at two years syncope had recurred in ten patients but the majority of recurrences were unassociated with defecationseven patients died during the followup period of underlying chronic diseaseswe conclude that defecation syncope is not a single distinct clinical entitymultiple pathologic abnormalities in association with physiologic changes during sleep and defecation may contribute to syncopepatients with defecation syncope should undergo a careful evaluation for diagnosis of underlying illness causing syncope
