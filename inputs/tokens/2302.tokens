most of adult women exhibit cellulite on the hips buttock and thighsalthough extracellular matrix and lymphatic system disorders can increase its appearance cellulite basically results from an excessive fat storage in the adipose tissue which exerts considerable pressure on the surrounding skin tissue and creates a dimpled irregular appearancecaffeine the most widely used anticellulite ingredient favours fat breakdown by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzyme and encouraging a high intracellular level of campa series of studies has shown that spermine and spermidine two ubiquitous polyamines encouraged fat storage and slowed fat breakdown in the adipose tissuebesides it was shown that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans had a strong affinity for polyaminesto design a new cosmetic ingredient with anticellulite properties we used molecular modelling to screen several ingredients with a structure similar to that of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycansthis way we identified sulfocarrabiose as a potent molecule for trapping spermine and spermidinethese virtual results were first confirmed in tubo where sulfocarrabiose was shown to dosedependently inactivate spermine and spermidinein vitro adipocytes cultured with sulfocarrabiose exhibited a significant reduction of lipogenesis and a significant increase of lipolysiswhen sulfocarrabiose was incorporated in a cosmetic formula significant improvements were observed in thigh circumference with better results than those obtained with caffeine after 28 days of usefurthermore a combination of caffeine and sulfocarrabiose led to results significantly better than those obtained with caffeine aloneas measured by fringe projection thigh volume was also significantly reduced after sulfocarrabiose treatmentfinally the appearance of cellulite assessed by clinical evaluation was also significantly reduced within 28 days 2010 basf beauty care solutionsics  2010 society of cosmetic scientists and the société française de cosmétologie
