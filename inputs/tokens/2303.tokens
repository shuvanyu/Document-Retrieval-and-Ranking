background putrescine spermidine and spermine are the polyamines required for human cell growththe inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase odc which is the ratelimiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis decreases tumor growth and the development of colorectal adenomasa database was developed to estimate dietary polyamine exposure and relate exposure to health outcomesobjective we hypothesized that high polyamine intake would increase risk of colorectal adenoma and that the allelic variation at odc ga 316 would modify the associationdesign polyamine exposure was estimated in subjects pooled n  1164 from the control arms of 2 randomized trials for colorectal adenoma prevention wheat bran fiber lowfiber diet arm n  585 and ursodeoxycholic acid placebo arm n  579 by using baseline foodfrequency questionnaire dataall subjects had to have a diagnosis of colorectal adenoma to be eligible for the trialresults a dietary intake of polyamines above the median amount in the study population was associated with 39 increased risk of colorectal adenoma at followup adjusted or 139 95 ci 106 183 in the pooled samplein addition younger participants or 194 95 ci 123 308 women or 243 95 ci 148 400 and odc gg genotype carriers or 159 95 ci 100 253 had significantly increased odds of colorectal adenoma if they consumed abovemedian polyamine amountsconclusions this study showed a role for dietary polyamines in colorectal adenoma riskcorroboration of these findings would confirm a previously unrecognized modifiable dietary risk factor for colorectal adenoma
