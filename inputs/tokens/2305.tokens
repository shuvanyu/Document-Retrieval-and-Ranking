adiponectin is discussed to regulate energy balance and insulin sensitivityseveral studies indicated an association of fasting adiponectin with parameters of the metabolic syndromewe investigated postprandial adiponectin release and its relation to traits of the metabolic syndromeserum adiponectin concentration after an oral glucose tolerance test and after ingestion of a standardised mixed fatcontaining meal in 110 male nondiabetic subjects was assessedfasting and postprandial adiponectin and the decrease of adiponectin were correlated with anthropometric and metabolic parameterssubjects were genotyped for adiponectin  11 388 ga promoter single nucleotide polymorphismadiponectin slightly decreased after both test mealsa significant decrease was attained 5 and 6 h after the lipid load and 2 h after the glucose loadparticularly the mixed meal postprandial adiponectin showed stronger correlations with most traits of the metabolic syndrome than fasting adiponectin postprandial adiponectin with hdl r 030 v fasting adiponectin with hdl r 023 with postprandial insulin area under the curve r  020 v r  016 with fasting insulin r 010 v r 014 with bmi r  023 v r  020 with waist r  018 v  016 with systolic blood pressure r  014 v r  012 with diastolic blood pressure r  018 v r  015in multivariate analysis postprandial tag were the only independent predictor of adiponectinthere was no significant association of adiponectin nefa and tag with  11 388 ga adiponectin promoter polymorphismour findings favour the interpretation that postprandial adiponectin has the strongest and independent associations to postprandial tag metabolism
