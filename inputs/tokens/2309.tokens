dietary lignan intakes have been associated with reduced breast cancer risks however no previous studies have investigated whether lignan intake might be associated with breast cancer survivalwe examined the association of dietary lignan intakes with survival in 1122 women with primary incident histologically confirmed breast cancer identified between 1996 and 2001 and with vital status determined through december 31 2006diet in the 1224 months before diagnosis was assessed with an extensive food frequency questionnaire and potential confounders assessed from an extensive epidemiologic interview and abstracted clinical datalignan intake was calculated using published food composition datahazard ratios hr and 95 confidence intervals cis for dietary lignan intakes with all cause and breast cancer mortality were estimated using cox proportional hazards adjusting for age education race total energy intake tumor stage and body mass indexof the 1122 women with complete dietary data 160 had died by the end of followupamong postmenopausal women only those in the highest versus lowest quartile of lignan intakes had a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all cause mortality hr 049 95 ci 026091 and a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer mortality hr 029 95 ci 011076higher intakes of dried beans hr 061 95 ci 036103 but not fruits vegetables or grains were also weakly associated with overall mortalityin summary our results suggest that higher lignan intakes may be associated with improved survival among postmenopausal women with breast cancer
