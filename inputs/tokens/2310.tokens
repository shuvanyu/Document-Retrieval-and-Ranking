oestrogen is an important determinant of breast cancer riskoestrogenmimicking plant compounds called phytoestrogens can bind to oestrogen receptors and exert weak oestrogenic effectsdespite this activity epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of breast cancer is lower in countries where the intake of phytoestrogens is high implying that these compounds may reduce breast cancer risk and possibly have an impact on survivalisoflavones and lignans are the most common phytoestrogens in the dietin this article we present findings from human observational and intervention studies related to both isoflavone and lignan exposure and breast cancer risk and survivalin addition the clinical implications of these findings are examined in the light of a growing dietary supplement marketan increasing number of breast cancer patients seek to take supplements together with their standard treatment in the hope that these will either prevent recurrence or treat their menopausal symptomsobservational studies suggest a protective effect of isoflavones on breast cancer risk and the case may be similar for increasing lignan consumption although evidence so far is inconsistentin contrast shortterm intervention studies suggest a possible stimulatory effect on breast tissue raising concerns of possible adverse effects in breast cancer patientshowever owing to the dearth of human studies investigating effects on breast cancer recurrence and survival the role of phytoestrogens remains unclearso far not enough clear evidence exists on which to base guidelines for clinical use although raising patient awareness of the uncertain effect of phytoestrogens is recommended
