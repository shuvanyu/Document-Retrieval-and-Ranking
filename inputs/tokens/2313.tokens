purpose flaxseed the richest source of mammalian lignan precursors has previously been shown to reduce the growth of tumors in ratsthis study examined in a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trial the effects of dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers and urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed breast cancerexperimental design patients were randomized to daily intake of either a 25 g flaxseedcontaining muffin n  19 or a control placebo muffin n  13at the time of diagnosis and again at definitive surgery tumor tissue was analyzed for the rate of tumor cell proliferation ki67 labeling index primary end point apoptosis cerbb2 expression and estrogen and progesterone receptor levelstwentyfourhour urine samples were analyzed for lignans and 3day diet records were evaluated for macronutrient and caloric intakemean treatment times were 39 and 32 days in the placebo and flaxseed groups respectivelyresults reductions in ki67 labeling index 342 p  0001 and in cerbb2 expression 710 p  0003 and an increase in apoptosis 307 p  0007 were observed in the flaxseed but not in the placebo groupno significant differences in caloric and macronutrient intake were seen between groups and between pre and posttreatment periodsa significant increase in mean urinary lignan excretion was observed in the flaxseed group 1300 p  001 compared with placebo controlsthe total intake of flaxseed was correlated with changes in cerbb2 score r  0373 p  0036 and apoptotic index r  0495 p  0004conclusion dietary flaxseed has the potential to reduce tumor growth in patients with breast cancer
