in our laboratories for several years two phenolic compounds have been detected during gas chromatographicmass spectrometric analysis of urinary steroid extracts from human and animal speciesalthough features of the mass spectra of their trimethylsilyl tms ether derivatives resembled those of oestrogens they were atypical of steroidsthe possibility that they were artefacts of the isolation procedures was discounted after careful studies with blanks by varying the extraction method and because they were present almost exclusively as conjugates of glucuronic acidseveral of the general characteristics of the unknown compounds were reported after one referred to as compound 180442 was found to have a cyclic pattern of excretion during the menstrual cycle of an adult vervet monkey fig1an investigation of the nature and distribution of the compounds has shown them to be urinary constituents in humans baboons vervet monkeys and rats and further related compounds have been detected so far only in vervet monkey urinewe now report spectroscopic and chemical studies that show the two original compounds to be lignans which have a 23dibenzylbutane skeleton as their basic structureunlike all previously known natural lignans invariably of plant origin the two mammalian compounds carry phenolic hydroxy groups only in the meta position of the aromatic rings
