background epidemiologic studies that examined whether lignans the most important class of phytoestrogens in the western diet protect against breast cancer have yielded inconsistent resultsobjective in this study we conducted metaanalyses on the association between lignans and breast cancer riskdesign we performed a systematic medline search to identify epidemiologic studies published between 1997 and august 2009we calculated pooled risk estimates res for total lignan exposure dietary lignan intake enterolignan exposure and blood or urine concentrations of enterolactone and according to menopausal and estrogen receptor er status of tumorsresults we included 21 studies 11 prospective cohort studies and 10 casecontrol studies in the metaanalyseslignan exposure was not associated with an overall breast cancer risk re 092 95 ci 081 102 p for heterogeneity  0004however in postmenopausal women high lignan intake was associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer 13 studies re 086 95 ci 078 094 p for heterogeneity  032breast cancer risk was also inversely associated with enterolignan exposure 4 studies re 084 95 ci 071 097 but not with blood or urine enterolactone concentrationsthe associations were not significantly different between erstatus subgroups 6 studiesconclusions high lignan exposure may be associated with a reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal womenadditional work is warranted to clarify the association between lignan exposure and breast cancer risk
