recently two groups of compounds with diphenolic structure the lignans and the isoflavonic phytoestrogens were detected and identified in human urine and other biological fluidsthese compounds are of great biological interest because they exhibit both in vitro and in vivo weak estrogenic and sometimes also antiestrogenic activities and many plant lignans have been shown to have anticarcinogenic antiviral antifungal and other interesting biological effectsthe compounds found in relatively large amounts 101000 times more than estrogens in urine are modified by intestinal bacteria from plant lignans and phytoestrogens which are present in fiberrich food such as grain and beansthey bind with low affinity to estrogen receptors and preliminary results suggest that they may induce production of sex hormone binding globulin shbg in the liver and in this way may influence sex hormone metabolism and biological effectsfive compounds the lignans enterolactone enl enterodiol end and the isoflavonic phytoestrogen metabolites daidzein da equol eq and odesmethylangolensin odma were measured in urine by gas chromatographymass spectrometry selected ion monitoring using deuterated internal standards in 5 groups of women total number 53the members of three dietary groups omnivores lactovegetarians and macrobiotics were living in boston and of two groups in helsinki omnivores and lactovegetariansuntil now measurements have been carried out in 94 72h samplesthe highest mean excretion of the most abundant compound enterolactone was found in the macrobiotic group and the lowest in the omnivoric groupstotal mean 24h excretion of enterolactone was 17680 nmol in the macrobiotics 4170 nmol in the boston lactovegetarians 3650 nmol in the helsinki lactovegetarians 2460 nmol in the helsinki omnivores and 2050 nmol in the boston omnivoresthe other diphenols followed approximately the same patternin an earlier study the lowest excretion of enterolactone 1040 nmol24 h was found in a group of postmenopausal apparently healthy breast cancer patients living in bostonit is concluded that further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible role of these compounds in cancer and other diseaseshowever the evidence obtained until now seems to justify the conclusion that these compounds may be among the dietary factors affording protection against hormonedependent cancers in vegetarians and semivegetarians
