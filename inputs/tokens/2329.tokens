the hypothesis that antibiotic use may increase cancer risk was first proposed several decades ago and some research suggests an increased risk of breast cancer among women with conditions likely to require longterm antibiotic use eg acne recurrent urinarytract infections utihowever this hypothesis has not been verified and the possible biological mechanisms are not entirely cleara recent cohort study in finland reported an increased risk of breastcancer associated with antibiotic use for utithe effect of antibiotics on the ability of intestinal microflora to metabolise phytochemicals from edible plants into compounds that may protect against cancer was proposed as a potential mechanismwe extend this hypothesis by proposing that antibiotic use may be associated with breastcancer risk through effects on immune and inflammatory factors such as cytokines t lymphocytes prostaglandins and matrix metalloproteinases as well as disruption of phytochemical and oestrogen metabolism by intestinal microflorawe suggest that some mechanisms may increase breastcancer risk while others may decrease risk depending on the antibiotic classification
