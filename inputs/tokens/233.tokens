one hundred and fifty hospital outpatients were questioned about their bowel habits and then asked to record these in diary booklets for two weeksoverall recalled and recorded figures for frequency of defecation agreed fairly closely but in 16 of patients there was a discrepancy of three or more bowel actions per weekthis was usually an exaggeration of the difference from the norm of one a daypatients were bad at predicting episodes of changed bowel frequencythese findings cast doubt on the value of population surveys of bowel habit based solely on questionnairesthey also suggest that the irritable bowel syndrome might be correctly diagnosed more often if patients were routinely asked to record their bowel actions
