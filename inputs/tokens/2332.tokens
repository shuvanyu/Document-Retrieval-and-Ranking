purpose evaluate the hypothesis that relation of breast cancer associated with dietary fiber intakes varies by type of fiber menopausal and the tumors hormone receptor statusmethods a casecontrol study of female breast cancer was conducted in connecticuta total of 557 incident breast cancer cases and 536 age frequencymatched controls were included in the analysisinformation on dietary intakes was collected through inperson interviews with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and was converted into nutrient intakesodds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were estimated by unconditional logistic regressionresults among premenopausal women higher intake of soluble fiber highest versus lowest quartile of intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer or  038 95 ci 015097 ptrend  008when further restricted to premenopausal women with er tumors the adjusted or for the highest quartile of intake was 015 95 ci 003069 ptrend  002 for soluble fiber intakeamong postmenopausal women no reduced risk of breast cancer was observed for either soluble or insoluble fiber intakes or among er or er tumor groupsconclusions the results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of er breast cancer among premenopausal womenadditional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results
