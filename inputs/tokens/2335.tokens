background skin sensitivity is a common problem in the western population correlated with changes of skin properties like skin barrier function hydration and skin physiologyskin properties can be modulated by dietary fatty acids fa especially polyunsaturated fathe present study was performed to evaluate the effect of daily supplementation with flaxseed oil and safflowerseed oil on healthy volunteers with sensitive skinmethods the study was designed as a randomized doubleblind 12week intervention with 2 female treatment groups n  13plasma fa profile skin sensitivity skin hydration transepidermal water loss tewl and skin surface were evaluated on day 0 week 6 and week 12results supplementation with flaxseed oil led to significant decreases in sensitivity after nicotinate irritation tewl skin roughness and scaling while smoothness and hydration were increasedconcomitantly the ratio of n6n3 fa in plasma decreasedupon supplementation with safflowerseed oil only a significant improvement in skin roughness and hydration was observed however the effects were less pronounced and determined at a later point in time than with flaxseed oilthe plasma n6n3 fa ratio increasedconclusion the data provide evidence that daily intake of flaxseed oil modulates skin conditioncopyright  2010 s karger ag basel
