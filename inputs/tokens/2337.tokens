background obesity leads to an increase in inflammation and insulin resistancethis study determined antioxidant activity of flaxseed and its role in inflammation and insulin resistance in obese glucose intolerant peoplemethods using a randomized crossover design nine obese glucose intolerant people consumed 40 g ground flaxseed or 40 g wheat bran daily for 12 weeks with a 4week washout periodplasma inflammation biomarkers crp tnfÎ± and il6 glucose insulin and thiobaribituric acid reactive substance tbars were measured before and after of each supplementationresults flaxseed supplementation decreased tbars p  00215 and homair p  00382flaxseed or wheat bran supplementation did not change plasma inflammatory biomarkersa positive relationship was found between tbars and homair r  062 p  00003conclusions the results of the study weakly support that decreased insulin resistance might have been secondary to antioxidant activity of flaxseedhowever the mechanisms of decreased insulin resistance by flaxseed should be further determined using flaxseed lignan
