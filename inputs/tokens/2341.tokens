background prostate cancer affects oneoutofsix men during their lifetimedietary factors are postulated to influence the development and progression of prostate cancerlowfat diets and flaxseed supplementation may offer potentially protective strategiesmethods we undertook a multisite randomized controlled trial to test the effects of lowfat andor flaxseedsupplemented diets on the biology of the prostate and other biomarkersprostate cancer patients n161 scheduled at least 21 days before prostatectomy were randomly assigned to one of the following arms 1 control usual diet 2 flaxseedsupplemented diet 30 gday 2 lowfat diet 20 total energy or 4 flaxseedsupplemented lowfat dietblood was drawn at baseline and prior to surgery and analyzed for prostate specific antigen psa sex hormone binding globulin testosterone insulinlike growth factor1 and binding protein3 creactive protein and total and low density lipoprotein cholesteroltumors were assessed for proliferation ki67 the primary endpoint and apoptosisresults men were on protocol an average of 30 daysproliferation rates were significantly lower p  0002 among men assigned to the flaxseed armsmedian ki67 positive cellstotal nuclei ratios x100 were 166 flaxseedsupplemented diet and 150 flaxseedsupplemented lowfat diet vs 323 control and 256 lowfat dietno differences were observed between arms with regard to side effects apoptosis and most serological endpoints however men on lowfat diets experienced significant decreases in serum cholesterol p0048conclusions findings suggest that flaxseed is safe and associated with biologic alterations that may be protective for prostate cancerdata also further support lowfat diets to manage serum cholesterol
