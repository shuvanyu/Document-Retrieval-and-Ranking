objectives dietary factors may influence the prostate and have an impact on prostatic growth and diseasea small number of studies have suggested that flaxseedsupplemented fatrestricted diets may thwart prostate cancer growth in both animals and humansunknown however is the potential effect of such a diet on benign prostatic epitheliummethods we undertook a pilot study to explore whether a flaxseedsupplemented fatrestricted diet affects the proliferation rates in benign epitheliumwe also explored the effects on circulating levels of prostatespecific antigen psa total testosterone and cholesterolfifteen men who were scheduled to undergo repeat prostate biopsy were instructed to follow a lowfat less than 20 kcal flaxseedsupplemented 30 gday diet and were provided with a supply of flaxseed to last throughout the 6month intervention periodthe psa total testosterone and cholesterol levels were determined at baseline and at 6 months of followupreports from the original and repeat biopsies were compared and proliferation mib1 rates were quantified in the benign prostatic epitheliumresults statistically significant decreases in psa 847  382 to 572  316 ngml p  00002 and cholesterol 2411  308 to 2133  512 mgdl p  0012 were observedno statistically significant change was seen in total testosterone 4345  1436 to 4283  925 ngdlalthough 6month repeat biopsies were not performed in 2 cases because of psa normalization of the 13 men who underwent repeat biopsy the proliferation rates in the benign epithelium decreased significantly from 0022  0027 at baseline to 0007  0014 at 6 months of followup p  00168conclusions these pilot data suggest that a flaxseedsupplemented fatrestricted diet may affect the biology of the prostate and associated biomarkersa randomized controlled trial is needed to determine whether flaxseed supplementation a lowfat diet or a combination of the two regimens may be of use in controlling overall prostatic growth
