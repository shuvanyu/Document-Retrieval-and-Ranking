a common approach to reducing microbial contamination has been the implementation of a hazard analysis and critical control point haccp program to prevent or reduce contamination during productionone example is the pathogen reduction haccp program implemented by the us department of agricultures food safety and inspection service fsisthis program consisted of a staged implementation between 1996 and 2000 to reduce microbial contamination on meat and poultry productsof the commodities regulated by fsis one of the largest observed reductions was for salmonella contamination on broiler chicken carcassesnevertheless how this reduction might have influenced the total number of salmonellosis cases in the united states has not been assessedthis study incorporates information from public health surveillance and surveys of the poultry slaughter industry into a model that estimates the number of broilerrelated salmonellosis cases through timethe model estimates thatfollowing the 56 reduction in the proportion of contaminated broiler carcasses observed between 1995 and 2000approximately 190000 fewer annual salmonellosis cases attributed to broilers occurred in 2000 compared with 1995the uncertainty bounds for this estimate range from approximately 37000 to 500000 illnessesestimated illnesses prevented due to the more modest reduction in contamination of 13 between 2000 and 2007 were not statistically significantan analysis relating the necessary magnitude of change in contamination required for detection via human surveillance also is provided
