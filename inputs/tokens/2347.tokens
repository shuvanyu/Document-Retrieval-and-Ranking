salmonella enterica is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness in the united statesalthough salmonellosis is usually selflimiting severe infections typically require antimicrobial treatment and ceftriaxone an extendedspectrum cephalosporin esc is commonly used in both adults and childrensurveillance conducted by the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system narms has shown a recent increase in esc resistance among salmonella heidelberg isolated from food animals at slaughter retail meat and humansesc resistance among salmonella in the united states is usually mediated by a plasmidencoded blacmy Î²lactamasein 2009 we identified 47 escresistant blacmypositive heidelberg isolates from humans n18 food animals at slaughter n16 and retail meats n13 associated with a spike in the prevalence of this serovaralmost 90 2629 of the animal and meat isolates were isolated from chicken carcasses or retail chicken meatwe screened narms isolates for the presence of blacmy determined whether the gene was plasmidencoded examined pulsedfield gel electrophoresis patterns to assess the genetic diversities of the isolates and categorized the blacmy plasmids by plasmid incompatibility groups and plasmid multilocus sequence typing pmlstall 47 blacmy genes were found to be plasmid encodedincompatibilityreplicon typing demonstrated that 41 were inci1 plasmids 40 of which only conferred blacmyassociated resistancesix were incac plasmids that carried additional resistance genespmlst of the inci1blacmy plasmids showed that 27 658 were sequence type st 12 the most common st among blacmyinci1 plasmids from heidelberg isolated from humansten plasmids had a new st profile st66 a type very similar to st12this work showed that the 2009 increase in esc resistance among salmonella heidelberg was caused mainly by the dissemination of blacmy on inci1 and incac plasmids in a variety of genetic backgrounds and is likely not the result of clonal expansion
