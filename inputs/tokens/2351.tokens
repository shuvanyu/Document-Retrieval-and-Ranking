summary antimicrobials are valuable therapeutics whose efficacy is seriously compromised by the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistancethe provision of antibiotics to food animals encompasses a wide variety of nontherapeutic purposes that include growth promotionthe concern over resistance emergence and spread to people by nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials has led to conflicted practices and opinionsconsiderable evidence supported the removal of nontherapeutic antimicrobials ntas in europe based on the precautionary principle still concrete scientific evidence of the favorable versus unfavorable consequences of ntas is not clear to all stakeholderssubstantial data show elevated antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with animals fed ntas and their food productsthis resistance spreads to other animals and humansdirectly by contact and indirectly via the food chain water air and manured and sludgefertilized soilsmodern genetic techniques are making advances in deciphering the ecological impact of ntas but modeling efforts are thwarted by deficits in key knowledge of microbial and antibiotic loads at each stage of the transmission chainstill the substantial and expanding volume of evidence reporting animaltohuman spread of resistant bacteria including that arising from use of ntas supports eliminating nta use in order to reduce the growing environmental load of resistance genes
