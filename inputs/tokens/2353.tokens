contamination of retail chicken meat by extended spectrum betalactamase esbl producing bacteria likely contributes to the increasing incidence of infections with these bacteria in humansthis study aimed to compare the prevalence and load of esbl positive isolates between organic and conventional retail chicken meat samples and to compare the distribution of esbl genes strain genotypes and coresistancein 2010 98 raw chicken breasts n60 conventional n38 organic were collected from 12 local stores in the netherlandsprevalence of esbl producing microorganisms was 100 on conventional and 84 on organic samples p0001median loads of esbl producing microorganisms were 80 range 201360 in conventional and 20 range 0260 cfu25 g in organic samples p0001the distribution of esbl genes in conventional samples and organic samples was 42 versus 56 respectively ns for ctxm1 20 versus 42 nsfor tem52 and 23 versus 3 p0001 for shv12ctxm2 7 shv2 5 and tem20 3 were exclusively found in conventional samplescoresistance rates of esbl positive isolates were not different between conventional and organic samples cotrimoxazole 56 ciprofloxacin 14 and tobramycin 2 except for tetracycline 73 and 46 respectively p0001six of 14 conventional meat samples harbored 4 mlst types also reported in humans and 5 of 10 organic samples harbored 3 mlst types also reported in humans 2 st10 2 st23 st354in conclusion the majority of organic chicken meat samples were also contaminated with esbl producing e coli and the esbl genes and strain types were largely the same as in conventional meat samplescopyright  2011 elsevier bv all rights reserved
