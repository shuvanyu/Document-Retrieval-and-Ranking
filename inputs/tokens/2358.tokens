the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a natural carbohydrate cho source in the form of sundried raisins sdrs vs sports jelly beans sjbs on endurance performance in trained cyclists and triathletesten healthy men 1833 years completed 1 wateronly acclimatization exercise trial and 2 randomized exercise trials administered in a crossover fashioneach trial consisted of a 120minute constantintensity glycogen depletion period followed by a 10km time trial ttduring each experimental trial participants consumed isocaloric amounts of sdrs or sjbs in 20minute intervalsmeasurements included time to complete 10km tt power output during 10km tt blood glucose levels and respiratory exchange ratio during glycogen depletion period rate of perceived exertion rpe flow questionnaire responses and a hedonic ie pleasantness sensory acceptance testthere were no significant differences in endurance performance for tt time sdrs vs sjbs 173  04 vs 173  04 seconds or power 2293  130 vs 2320  136 w resting blood glucose levels 58  04 mmoll1 for sdrs and 54  02 mmoll1 for sjbs rpe or flow experiences between sdr and sjb trialshowever the mean sensory acceptance scores were significantly higher for the sdrs compared to the sjbs 507  17 vs 443  27consuming sdrs or sjbs during 120 minutes of intense cycling results in similar subsequent tt performances and are equally effective in maintaining blood glucose levels during exercisetherefore sdrs are a natural pleasant costeffective cho alternative to commercial sjbs that can be used during moderate to highintensity endurance exercise
