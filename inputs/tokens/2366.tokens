background evidence suggests that consumption of apple or its bioactive components modulate lipid metabolism and reduce the production of proinflammatory moleculeshowever there is a paucity of such research in human beingsobjective women experience a lower rate of cardiovascular disease before menopause compared with menhowever after the onset of menopause the risk of cardiovascular disease increases drastically due to ovarian hormone deficiencyhence we conducted a 1year clinical trial to evaluate the effect of dried apple vs dried plum consumption in reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal womendesign onehundred sixty qualified postmenopausal women were recruited from the greater tallahassee fl area during 20072009 and were randomly assigned to one of two groups dried apple 75 gday or dried plum comparative controlfasting blood samples were collected at baseline 3 6 and 12 months to measure various parametersphysical activity recall and 7day dietary recall were also obtainedresults neither of the dried fruit regimens significantly affected the participants reported total energy intake throughout the study periodon the contrary women who consumed dried apple lost 15 kg body weight by the end of the study albeit not significantly different from the dried plum groupin terms of cholesterol serum total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the dried apple group compared with the dried plum group only at 6 monthsalthough dried plum consumption did not significantly reduce serum total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels it lowered their levels numerically by 35 and 8 respectively at 12 months compared with baselinethis may explain the lack of significance observed between the groupshowever within the group women who consumed dried apple had significantly lower serum levels of total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol by 9 and 16 respectively at 3 months compared with baselinethese serum values were further decreased to 13 and 24 respectively after 6 months but stayed constant thereafterthe withingroup analysis also reported that daily apple consumption profoundly improved atherogenic risk ratios whereas there were no significant changes in lipid profile or atherogenic risk ratios as a result of dried plum consumptionboth dried fruits were able to lower serum levels of lipid hydroperoxide and creactive proteinhowever serum creactive protein levels were significantly lower in the dried plum group compared with the dried apple group at 3 monthsconclusions there were no significant differences between the dried apple and dried plum groups in altering serum levels of atherogenic cholesterols except total cholesterol at 6 monthshowever when within treatment group comparisons are made consumption of 75 g dried apple about two mediumsized apples can significantly lower atherogenic cholesterol levels as early as 3 monthsfurthermore consumption of dried apple and dried plum are beneficial to human health in terms of antiinflammatory and antioxidative propertiescopyright  2012 academy of nutrition and dieteticspublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
