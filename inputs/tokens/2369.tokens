the steroid hormone output of the adrenal gland is crucial in the maintenance of hormonal homeostasis with hormonal imbalances being associated with numerous clinical conditions which include amongst others hypertension metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease insulin resistance and type 2 diabetesaspalathus linearis rooibos which has been reported to aid stressrelated symptoms linked to metabolic diseases contains a wide spectrum of bioactive phenolic compounds of which aspalathin is uniquein this study the inhibitory effects of rooibos and the dihydrochalcones aspalathin and nothofagin were investigated on adrenal steroidogenesisthe activities of both cytochrome p450 17αhydroxylase1720 lyase and cytochrome p450 21hydroxylase were significantly inhibited in cos1 cellsin order to study the effect of these compounds in h295r cells a human adrenal carcinoma cell line a novel uplcmsms method was developed for the detection and quantification of twentyone steroid metabolites using a single chromatographic separationunder both basal and forskolinstimulated conditions the total amount of steroids produced in h295r cells significantly decreased in the presence of rooibos aspalathin and nothofaginunder stimulated conditions rooibos decreased the total steroid output 4fold and resulted in a significant reduction of aldosterone and cortisol precursorsdehydroepiandrosteronesulfate levels were unchanged while the levels of androstenedione a4 and 11βhydroxyandrostenedione 11βoha4 were inhibited 55 and 23fold respectivelyquantification of 11βoha4 showed this metabolite to be a major product of steroidogenesis in h295r cells and we confirm for the first time that this steroid metabolite is the product of the hydroxylation of a4 by human cytochrome p450 11βhydroxylasetaken together our results demonstrate that rooibos aspalathin and nothofagin influence steroid hormone biosynthesis and the flux through the mineralocorticoid glucocorticoid and androgen pathways thus possibly contributing to the alleviation of negative effects arising from elevated glucocorticoid levelscopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
