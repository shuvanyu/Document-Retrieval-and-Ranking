objective inadvertent exposure to the ubiquitous weed urtica dioica called stinging nettles produces an immediate stinging and burning sensation on the skinthis investigation evaluates the structural effect that stinging nettle spicules may have on the clinical manifestation of these symptomsthis hypothesis was investigated by exposing murine skin to stinging nettles and then evaluating the skin using electron microscopyit was hypothesized that the mechanism of action of stinging nettles is both biochemical and mechanical which may have clinical significance regarding treatment for acute exposuremethods fresh postmortem dermis samples from the carcasses of genetically modified hairless mice were brushed under the stem and leaf of a stinging nettle plant mimicking the clinical method of exposure a patient might experienceanother set of mouse skin samples was obtained but not exposed to the nettlesboth sets of skin samples were imaged with scanning electron microscopyresults the skin samples that were not exposed to nettle leaves were uniform with occasional striated hairs on the skin surface and no nettle spiculesthe skin samples exposed to nettle leaves showed many smooth nettle spicules piercing the skin surfacea few spicules retained their bases which appear empty of any liquid contentsconclusions the mechanism of action of stinging nettles dermatitis appears to be both biochemical and mechanicalimpalement of spicules into the skin likely accounts for the mechanical irritation in addition to the known adverse chemical effects of stinging nettlesfurther investigation of treatment modalities is warrantedcopyright  2011 wilderness medical societypublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
