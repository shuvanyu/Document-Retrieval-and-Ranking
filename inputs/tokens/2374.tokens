purpose to determine the effects of therapy with urtica dioica for symptomatic relief of lower urinary tract symptoms luts secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia bphmaterial and methods a 6month doubleblind placebocontrolled randomized partial crossover comparative trial of urtica dioica with placebo in 620 patients was conductedpatients were evaluated using the international prostate symptom score ipss the maximum urinary flow rate qmax postvoid residual urine volume pvr serum prostatic specific antigen psa testosterone levels and prostate sizeat the end of 6month trial unblinding revealed that patients who initially received the placebo were switched to urtica dioicaboth groups continued the medication up to 18 monthsresults 558 patients 90 completed the study 287305 91 in the urtica dioica group and 271315 86 in the placebo groupby intention totreat analysis at the end of 6month trial 232 81 of 287 patients in the urtica dioica group reported improved luts compared with 43 16 of 271 patients in the placebo group p  0001both ipss and qmax showed greater improvement with drug than with placebothe ipss went from 198 down to 118 with urtica dioica and from 192 to 177 with placebo p  0002peak flow rates improved by 34 mls for placebo recipients and by 82 mls for treated patients p  005in urtica dioica group pvr decreased from an initial value of 73 to 36 ml p  005no appreciable change was seen in the placebo groupserum psa and testosterone levels were unchanged in both groupsa modest decrease in prostate size as measured by transrectal ultrasonography trus was seen in urtica dioica group from 401 cc initially to 363 cc p  0001there was no change in the prostate volume at the end of study with placeboat 18month followup only patients who continued therapy had a favorable treatment variables valueno side effects were identified in either groupconclusion in the present study urtica dioica have beneficial effects in the treatment of symptomatic bphfurther clinical trials should be conducted to confirm these results before concluding that urtica dioica is effective
