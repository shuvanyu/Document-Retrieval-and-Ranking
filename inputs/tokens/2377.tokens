objective epidemiologic studies consistently link caffeine a nonselective adenosine antagonist to lower risk of parkinson disease pdhowever the symptomatic effects of caffeine in pd have not been adequately evaluatedmethods we conducted a 6week randomized controlled trial of caffeine in pd to assess effects upon daytime somnolence motor severity and other nonmotor featurespatients with pd with daytime somnolence epworth 10 were given caffeine 100 mg twice daily 3 weeks then 200 mg twice daily 3 weeks or matching placebothe primary outcome was the epworth sleepiness scale scoresecondary outcomes included motor severity sleep markers fatigue depression and quality of lifeeffects of caffeine were analyzed with bayesian hierarchical models adjusting for study site baseline scores age and sexresults of 61 patients 31 were randomized to placebo and 30 to caffeineon the primary intentiontotreat analysis caffeine resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in epworth sleepiness scale score 171 points 95 confidence interval ci 357 013however somnolence improved on the clinical global impression of change 064 016 113 intentiontotreat with significant reduction in epworth sleepiness scale score on perprotocol analysis 197 387 005caffeine reduced the total unified parkinsons disease rating scale score 469 points 77 16 and the objective motor component 315 points 550 083other than modest improvement in global health measures there were no changes in quality of life depression or sleep qualityadverse events were comparable in caffeine and placebo groupsconclusions caffeine provided only equivocal borderline improvement in excessive somnolence in pd but improved objective motor measuresthese potential motor benefits suggest that a larger longterm trial of caffeine is warrantedclassification of evidence this study provides class i evidence that caffeine up to 200 mg bid for 6 weeks had no significant benefit on excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with pd
