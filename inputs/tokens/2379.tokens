objective to prospectively examine whether higher intakes of total flavonoids and their subclasses flavanones anthocyanins flavan3ols flavonols flavones and polymers were associated with a lower risk of developing parkinson disease pdmethods in the current analysis we included 49281 men in the health professional followup study and 80336 women from the nurses health studyfive major sources of flavonoidrich foods tea berry fruits apples red wine and orangeorange juice were also examinedflavonoid intake was assessed using an updated food composition database and a validated food frequency questionnaireresults we identified 805 participants 438 men and 367 women who developed pd during 2022 years of followupin men after adjusting for multiple confounders participants in the highest quintile of total flavonoids had a 40lower pd risk than those in the lowest quintile hazard ratio hr  060 95 confidence interval 043 083 p trend  0001no significant relationship was observed in women p trend  062 or in pooled analyses p trend  023in the pooled analyses for the subclasses intakes of anthocyanins and a rich dietary source berries were significantly associated with a lower pd risk hr comparing 2 extreme intake quintiles were 076 for anthocyanins and 077 for berries respectively p trend  002 for bothconclusions our findings suggest that intake of some flavonoids may reduce pd risk particularly in men but a protective effect of other constituents of plant foods cannot be excluded
