objective defining normal stool habit is important when evaluating diarrhoea or constipation but common confounders such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs or the intake of medications with gastrointestinal side effects have not been considered in earlier population based studies defining what is normalwe hypothesized that the exclusion of subjects with common confounders would help to better understand what are normal bowel habitswe aimed to prospectively study bowel habits in a carefully studied random sample of the general populationmaterial and methods two hundred and sixtyeight randomly selected subjects between 18 and 70 years completed symptom diaries for one week and were clinically evaluated by a gastroenterologistthey also had a colonoscopy and laboratory investigations to exclude organic diseaseresults one hundred and twentyfour subjects had no organic gastrointestinal abnormality ibs or relevant medication 98 of them had between three stools per day and three per weekseventyseven percent of all stools were normal 12 hard and 10 loose in consistencyurgency was reported by 36 straining by 47 and incomplete defecation by 46after the exclusion of subjects with organic abnormalities women had significantly more symptoms than men in terms of abdominal pain bloating constipation urgency and feeling of incomplete evacuation but these gender differences disappeared after excluding subjects with ibsconclusions this study confirms that normal stool frequency is between three per week and three per daywe could not demonstrate any gender or age differences in terms of stool frequency defecatory symptoms or abdominal bloatingsome degree of urgency straining and incomplete evacuation should be considered normal
