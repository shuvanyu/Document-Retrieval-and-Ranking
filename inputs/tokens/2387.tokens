polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are synthetic chemicals primarily used as coolants and insulators in electrical equipmentalthough banned for several decades pcbs continue to exist in the environment because of their long halflife continued presence in items produced before the ban and poor disposal practicesepidemiological and experimental studies have identified exposure to pcbs as a potential risk factor for parkinsons disease perhaps more so in femalesthe objective of this work was to examine the association between pcb levels in postmortem human brain tissue and the diagnosis of parkinsons disease as well as the degree of nigral depigmentationwe also sought to determine if this association was more significant when patients were stratified by sexpostmortem brain samples from control patients and those diagnosed with parkinsons disease were obtained from the emory university brain bank and from the nun studyconcentrations of eight prevalent pcb congeners were extracted from postmortem brain tissue and analyzed using gas chromatographymass spectrometrypcb congeners 153 and 180 were significantly elevated in the brains of parkinsons disease patientswhen stratified by sex the female parkinsons disease group demonstrated significantly elevated concentrations of total pcbs and specifically congeners 138 153 and 180 compared to controls whereas pcb concentrations in males were not significantly different between control and parkinsons disease groupsin a separate population of women nun study who had no clinical signs or symptoms of pd elevated concentrations total pcb and congeners 138 153 and 180 were also observed in postmortem brain tissue exhibiting moderate nigral depigmentation compared to subjects with mild or no depigmentationthese quantitative data demonstrate an association between brain pcb levels and parkinsons diseaserelated pathologyfurthermore these data support epidemiological and laboratory studies reporting a link between pcb exposure and an increased risk for parkinsons disease including greater susceptibility of females
