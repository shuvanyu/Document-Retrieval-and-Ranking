the effects of açai polyphenolics on the antiproliferation and induction of apoptosis in hl60 human leukemia cells were investigatedinteractions between anthocyanins and nonanthocyaninpolyphenolics in both their glycosidic and their aglycone forms were also investigated to determine additive or nonadditive responsespolyphenolic fractions at 017107 microm were found to reduce cell proliferation from 56 to 86 likely due to caspase3 activation apoptosisanthocyanin and polyphenolic fractions were nonadditive in their contribution to the cell antiproliferation activityat equimolar concentrations the glycosidic forms of phenolic acids and flavonoids induced a higher magnitude of change in cell parameters proliferation and apoptosis than their respective aglycone forms while the opposite trend was observed for anthocyanin aglyconesthis study demonstrated that açai offers a rich source of bioactive polyphenolics and confirmed the importance of investigating whole food systems when evaluating the potential health benefits of individual phytochemical compounds
