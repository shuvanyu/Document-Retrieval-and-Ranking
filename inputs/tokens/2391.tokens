background the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of açai fruit pulp on risk factors for metabolic disorders in overweight subjectsthe açaí palm euterpe oleracea mart which is native to south america produces a small blackpurple fruit which is ediblethe fruit has recently become popular as a functional food due to its antioxidant potentialalthough several studies have been conducted in vitro and with animals little is known about the potential health benefits in humans aside from an increase in plasma antioxidant capacitymetabolic syndrome is a condition which is defined by a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease andor type2 diabetespreliminary studies indicate that a reduction in reactive oxygen species can assist in the normalization of the metabolic pathways involved in this syndromemethods this was an open label pilot study conducted with 10 overweight adults bmi  25 kgm2 and  30 kgm2 who took 100 g açai pulp twice daily for 1 monththe study endpoints included levels of fasting plasma glucose insulin cholesterol triglycerides exhaled breath nitric oxide metabolites eno and plasma levels of high sensitivity creactive protein hscrpthe response of blood glucose blood pressure and eno to a standardized meal was determined at baseline and following the 30 day treatmentresults compared to baseline there were reductions in fasting glucose and insulin levels following the 30 day treatment both p  002there was also a reduction in total cholesterol p  003 as well as borderline significant reductions in ldlcholesterol and the ratio of total cholesterol to hdlcholesterol both p  0051compared to baseline treatment with açai ameliorated the postprandial increase in plasma glucose following the standardized meal measured as the area under the curve p  0047there was no effect on blood pressure hscrp or enoconclusion in this uncontrolled pilot study consumption of açai fruit pulp reduced levels of selected markers of metabolic disease risk in overweight adults indicating that further studies are warranted
