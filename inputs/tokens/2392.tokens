the health benefits associated with pomegranate juice have led to the development of pomegranate extracts as botanical dietary supplementspomegranates contain hydrolyzable tannins in the form of punicalagins and punicalin as well as tanninbased complex oligomers that account for much of the antioxidant activity in juicethe content of ellagic acid has been used to standardize most pomegranate extract dietary supplements marketedhowever supplements can be adulterated with ellagic acid from less expensive plant sources and undercut this method of standardizationto compare the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities of commercially available pomegranate extract dietary supplements beyond their content of ellagic acid a total of 27 different supplements in the form of capsules tablets and soft gels were studiedtotal phenolics were measured using both gallic acid equivalent gae and ellagic acid equivalent eae assayspunicalagins punicalin and ellagic acid contents were determined by hplc whereas antioxidant capacity was measured using the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity teac assayof the 27 supplements tested only 5 had the typical pomegranate tannin profile by hplc 17 had ellagic acid as the predominant chemical with minor or no detectable pomegranate tannins and 5 had no detectable tannins or ellagic acidtherefore standardization of pomegranate extract supplements based on their ellagic acid content does not guarantee pomegranate supplement authenticityfuture research is needed to assess the health impact of substituting ellagic acid for the complex mix of phytochemicals in a pomegranate extract dietary supplement
