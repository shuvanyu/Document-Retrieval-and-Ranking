the pomegranate fruit  punica granatum  has become an international highvalue crop for the production of commercial pomegranate juice pjthe perceived consumer value of pj is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic pjto establish criteria for authenticating pj a new international multidimensional authenticity specifications imas algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the united statesin addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the united states data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from iran turkey azerbaijan syria india and china were considered in developing this protocolthere is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in pjat a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees brix pj contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at 03 g100 mlratios of glucose to mannitol of 415 and of glucose to fructose of 0810 are also characteristic of pjin addition no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processingstable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as  25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to pjsorbitol was present at 0025 g100 ml maltose and tartaric acid were not detectedthe presence of the amino acid proline at 25 mgl is indicative of added grape productsmalic acid at 01 g100 ml indicates adulteration with apple pear grape cherry plum or aronia juiceother adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia blueberry or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poorquality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice which results in abnormal anthocyanin profilesto adjust the astringent taste of poorquality juice or peel extract addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration methodthe profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated imas for pj which can be utilized to detect pj adulterationin this survey of commercial pomegranate juices only 6 of 23 strictly met all of the imas criteria
