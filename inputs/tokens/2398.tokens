the açaí acai fruit is a popular nutritional supplement that purportedly enhances immune system functionthese anecdotal claims are supported by limited studies describing immune responses to the acai polyphenol fractionpreviously we characterized γδ t cell responses to both polyphenol and polysaccharide fractions from several plantderived nutritional supplementssimilar polyphenol and polysaccharide fractions are found in acai fruitthus we hypothesized that one or both of these fractions could activate γδ t cellscontrary to previous reports we did not identify agonist activity in the polyphenol fraction however the acai polysaccharide fraction induced robust γδ t cell stimulatory activity in human mouse and bovine pbmc culturesto characterize the immune response to acai polysaccharides we fractionated the crude polysaccharide preparation and tested these fractions for activity in human pbmc culturesthe largest acai polysaccharides were the most active in vitro as indicated by activation of myeloid and γδ t cellswhen delivered in vivo acai polysaccharide induced myeloid cell recruitment and il12 productionthese results define innate immune responses induced by the polysaccharide component of acai and have implications for the treatment of asthma and infectious disease
