background a male epidemic of ischaemic heart disease ihd emerges with economic developmentit has previously been hypothesised that this epidemic is due to nutritionally driven levels of pubertal sex steroids which lead to a more atherogenic body shape and lipid profile in boys but not girls without any sexspecific effects on glucose metabolismthis study tests this hypothesis by examining the association of childhood meat eating with ihd risk in a developing chinese populationmethods multivariable linear and censored regression was used in a crosssectional study of 19418 chinese older  50 years men and women from the guangzhou biobank cohort study phases 2 and 3 to assess the adjusted associations of childhood meat eating with waist to hip ratio whr highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting plasma glucoseresults adjusted for age childhood hunger lifecourse socioeconomic position and current lifestyle childhood almost daily meat eating compared with less than weekly meat eating was associated with higher whr 0007 95 ci 00003 to 001 in men but not womenno association with fasting glucose was observedconclusions given the potential limitations of this study especially the crude nature of the exposure and modest findings the results should be considered as preliminaryhowever they do lend support to the hypothesis that the male epidemic of premature ihd and sexual divergence in ihd rates that occur with economic development may be nutritionally driven in childhoodin elucidating the developmental origins of noncommunicable chronic diseases more attention should be focused on the sociohistorical context and the role of puberty
