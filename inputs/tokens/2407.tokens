dietary microparticles are nonbiological bacterialsized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation calcium phosphate or following oral exposure exogenous microparticlein the uk about 40 mg 1012 of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day through exposure to food additives pharmaceuticalsupplement excipients or toothpaste constituentsonce ingested exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumenboth entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactionscalcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction adsorption of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal florathe major but not only sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the mcell rich lymphoid aggregates termed peyers patches in the small bowelindeed it is well established that this is an efficient transport route for nonbiological microparticles although it is unclear whywe hypothesise that this pathway exists for endogenous microparticles of calcium phosphate with immunological and physiological benefit and that exogenous dietary microparticles such as titanium dioxide and the silicates hijack this routethis overview focuses on what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune tolerance of the gut endogenous microparticles or immune activation exogenous microparticles and inflammation of the gut
