background and aims dietary microparticles which are bacteriasized and nonbiological found in the modern western diet have been implicated in both the aetiology and pathogenesis of crohns diseasefollowing on from the findings of a previous pilot study we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with active crohns disease in a singleblind randomized multicentre placebo controlled trialmethods eightythree patients with active crohns disease were randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in microparticles andor calcium for 16 weeksall patients received a reducing dose of prednisolone for 6 weeksoutcome measures were crohns disease activity index van hees index quality of life and a series of objective measures of inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate creactive protein intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectinafter 16 weeks patients returned to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeksresults dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any of the outcome measures during the dietary trial 16 weeks or followup to 1 year eg for logistic regression of crohns disease activity index based rates of remission p01 and clinical response p08 in normal versus low microparticle groupsconclusions our adequately powered and carefully controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake aids remission in active crohns disease
