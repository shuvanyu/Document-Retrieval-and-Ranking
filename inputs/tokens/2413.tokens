crohns disease is a modern western disease characterised by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tractit is of unknown aetiology but evidence suggests that it results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factorsbacterialsized microparticles 0110 microm are potent adjuvants in model antigenmediated immune responses and are increasingly associated with diseasemicroparticles of tio2 and aluminosilicate accumulate in macrophages of human gutassociated lymphoid tissue where the earliest signs of lesions in crohns disease are observeddietary microparticles are of endogenous or exogenous originendogenous microparticles dominate and are calcium phosphate most probably hydroxyapatite which precipitates in the lumen of the middistal gastrointestinal tract due to secretion of ca and phosphate in the succus entericusexogenous dietary microparticles are contaminants soil andor dust and food additivestio2 for example is a food colourant and aluminosilicates are anticaking agents although some aluminosilicates occur as natural contaminantsfood additives alone account for ingestion of approximately 1012 particlesperson per d possible mechanisms for the role of exogenous and endogenous dietary microparticles in promoting toleragenic or immune responses of gastrointestinal mucosal phagocytosis are discussedin a doubleblind randomised pilot study we have shown that a diet low in ca and exogenous microparticles appears to alleviate the symptoms of ileal crohns disease with a significant p 0002 improvement in the crohns disease activity indexa multicentre trial and further mechanistic studies at the cellular level are underway
