humans have evolved with oral exposure to dietary microparticles and nanoparticles as a normal occurrence but the evergrowing exploitation of nanotechnology is likely to increase exposure further both qualitatively and quantitativelymoreover unlike the situation with respirable particles relatively little is known about gastrointestinal intake and handling of nanoparticleswith a long term interest in gut exposure and responses to dietary microparticles our group is now applying its expertise to nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal tracthere we aim to address i the current challenges associated with the characterisation of particlehost or particlecell interactions ii the origin and mechanisms of uptake of particles in the gastrointestinal tract especially via the peyers patch and iii potential cellular effects of nanoparticles in the generation of reactive oxygen species and inflammasome activation or microparticles in their adjuvant activity in proinflammatory signalling and immune responsivenesscopyright 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
