titanium dioxide is a common additive in many food personal care and other consumer products used by people which after use can enter the sewage system and subsequently enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land incinerated wastes or landfill solidsthis study quantifies the amount of titanium in common food products derives estimates of human exposure to dietary nano tio2 and discusses the impact of the nanoscale fraction of tio2 entering the environmentthe foods with the highest content of tio2 included candies sweets and chewing gumsamong personal care products toothpastes and select sunscreens contained 1 to 10 titanium by weightwhile some other crèmes contained titanium despite being colored white most shampoos deodorants and shaving creams contained the lowest levels of titanium 001 μgmgfor several highconsumption pharmaceuticals the titanium content ranged from below the instrument detection limit 00001 μg timg to a high of 0014 μg timgelectron microscopy and stability testing of foodgrade tio2 e171 suggests that approximately 36 of the particles are less than 100 nm in at least one dimension and that it readily disperses in water as fairly stable colloidshowever filtration of water solubilized consumer products and personal care products indicated that less than 5 of the titanium was able to pass through 045 or 07 μm porestwo white paints contained 110 μg timg while three sealants ie prime coat paint contained less titanium 25 to 40 μg timgthis research showed that while many whitecolored products contained titanium it was not a prerequisitealthough several of these product classes contained low amounts of titanium their widespread use and disposal down the drain and eventually to wwtps deserves attentiona monte carlo human exposure analysis to tio2 through foods identified children as having the highest exposures because tio2 content of sweets is higher than other food products and that a typical exposure for a us adult may be on the order of 1 mg ti per kilogram body weight per daythus because of the millions of tons of titanium based white pigment used annually testing should focus on foodgrade tio2 e171 rather than that adopted in many environmental health and safety tests ie p25 which is used in much lower amounts in products less likely to enter the environment eg catalyst supports photocatalytic coatings
