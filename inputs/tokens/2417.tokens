various specific and nonspecific environmental factors have been associated with the induction andor exacerbation of disease activity in patients with crohns disease and ulcerative colitisone such factor is the potential role of ingested ultrafine particlesin fact based on a western diet recent data suggest that more than 1012ultrafine particles are ingested per person every daythese microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal lymphoid aggregatesbased on these observations we determined whether one such dietary microparticle titanium dioxide tio2 alters intestinal cell responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide lps using colonic biopsy specimens from 28 patients with ulcerative colitis 21 with crohns disease and 36 healthy controlsthese samples as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells when available were incubated alone control or with either a lps 12000 ngml b tio25 microgml or c lps 1 ngml adsorbed to tio25 microgmlin each case the levels of interleukin 1 il1 produced in these assays were quantitated by bioassay and by elisainterestingly there was dramatic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the tio2lps conjugate with values 3060fold above controls and only minor stimulation with lps or tio2alonein intestinal organ cultures there was no increase in il1 secretion when challenged with tio2alone or with up to 2000 ngml lpshowever the tio2lps conjugate produced a twotothreefold significant increase in the intestinal secretion of il1our data demonstrate that ultrafine dietary particles are not immunologically inert and may be important adjuncts in overcoming normal gut cell hyporesponsiveness to endogenous luminal moleculesthis may be particularly relevant to patients with inflammatory bowel disease where there is abnormal intestinal permeabilitycopyright 2000 academic press
