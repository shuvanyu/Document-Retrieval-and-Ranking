a cephalic phase of colonic pressure response to food was sought in five normal subjects mean age 226 years 2224 studied on six separate occasions by recording intraluminal pressures in the unprepared sigmoid colongastric acid secretion was measured simultaneously by continuous aspiration through a nasogastric tubeafter a 60 minute basal period one of five 30 minute food related cephalic stimuli or a control stimulus was given in random order records were continued for a further 120 minutesthe cephalic stimuli were food discussion sight and smell of food without taste smell of food without sight or taste sight of food without smell or taste and modified sham feeding the control stimulus was a discussion of neutral topicscolonic pressures were expressed as study segment activity index area under curve mm hgmin derived by fully automated computer analysisgastric acid output was expressed as mmol30 minfood discussion significantly p  002 wilcoxons rank sum test increased colonic pressure activity compared with control or basal activitysmell of food without sight or taste also significantly p  003 increased the colonic pressure activity compared with control and basal periodssham feeding and sight and smell of food without taste significantly p  002 and p  003 increased colonic pressures compared with control but not basal activitythe increase in colonic activity after sight of food without smell or taste was not significantly different from control or basal activity p  044 and p  034food discussion was the strongest colonic stimulus testedfood discussion and sham feeding significantly p002 stimulated gastric acid output above control and basal valuessight and smell of food without taste significantly p002 increased acid output above basalsmell of food without sight or taste and sight of food without smell or taste did not significantly p006 p034 increase acid outputin contrast with the effect on colonic pressures sham feeding was the best stimulus of acid outputincreased colonic pressure activity after food discussion correlated significantly r045 p002 with gastric acid outputthere was no correlation r01 p05 between colonic pressure activity and gastric acid output in the control studythese data show that there is a cephalic phase of the colonic response to food
