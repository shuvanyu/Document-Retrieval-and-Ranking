background viral respiratory tract infection vrti is the most common illness in humansdespite the high incidence the economic impact of noninfluenzarelated vrti has not been rigorously exploredour objectives were to obtain an updated incidence of noninfluenzarelated vrti in the united states and to quantify the health care resource use direct costs and productivity losses indirect costs associated with these infectionsmethods a nationwide telephone survey of us households n  4051 was conducted between november 3 2000 and february 12 2001 to obtain a representative estimate of the selfreported incidence of noninfluenzarelated vrti and related treatment patternsdirect treatment costs measured included outpatient clinician encounters use of overthecounter and prescription drugs and associated infectious complications of noninfluenzarelated vrtiabsenteeism estimates for infected individuals and parents of infected children were extrapolated from national health interview survey dataresults of survey respondents 72 reported a noninfluenzarelated vrti within the past yearrespondents who experienced a selfreported noninfluenzarelated vrti averaged 25 episodes annuallywhen these rates are extrapolated to the entire us population approximately 500 million noninfluenzarelated vrti episodes occur per yearsimilarly if the treatment patterns reported by the respondents are extended to the population the total economic impact of noninfluenzarelated vrti approaches 40 billion annually direct costs 17 billion per year and indirect costs 225 billion per yearconclusions largely because of the high attack rate noninfluenzarelated vrti imposes a greater economic burden than many other clinical conditionsthe pending availability of effective antiviral therapies warrants increased attention be paid to this common and expensive illness
