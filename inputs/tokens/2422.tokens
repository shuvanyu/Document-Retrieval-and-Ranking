background in japan gargling is a generally accepted way of preventing upper respiratory tract infection urtithe effectiveness of gargling for preventing urti has been shown in a randomized controlled trial that compared incidences of urti between gargling and control groupsfrom the perspective of the thirdparty payer gargling is dominant due to the fact that the costs of gargling are borne by the participanthowever the costeffectiveness of gargling from a societal perspective should be consideredin this study economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was performed to evaluate the costeffectiveness of gargling for preventing urti from a societal perspectivemethods among participants in the gargling trial 122 watergargling and 130 control subjects were involved in the economic analysissixtyday cumulative followup costs and effectiveness measured by qualityadjusted life days qald were compared between groups on an intentiontotreat basisincremental costeffectiveness ratio icer was converted to dollars per qualityadjusted life years qalythe 95 confidence interval 95ci and probability of gargling being costeffective were estimated by bootstrappingresults after 60 days qald was increased by 043 and costs were 371 higher in the gargling group than in the control groupicer of the gargling group was 31800qaly 95ci 1900248100although this resembles many acceptable forms of medical intervention including urti preventive measures such as influenza vaccination the broad confidence interval indicates uncertainty surrounding our resultsin addition oneway sensitivity analysis also indicated that careful evaluation is required for the cost of gargling and the utility of moderate urtithe major limitation of this study was that this trial was conducted in winter at a time when urti is prevalentcare must be taken when applying the results to a season when urti is not prevalent since the icer will increase due to decreases in incidenceconclusion this study suggests gargling as a costeffective preventive strategy for urti that is acceptable from perspectives of both the thirdparty payer and society
