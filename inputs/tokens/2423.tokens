objectives to investigate the effect of dog and cat contacts on the frequency of respiratory symptoms and infections during the first year of lifemethods in this birth cohort study 397 children were followed up from pregnancy onward and the frequency of respiratory symptoms and infections together with information about dog and cat contacts during the first year of life were reported by using weekly diaries and a questionnaire at the age of 1 yearall the children were born in eastern or middle finland between september 2002 and may 2005results in multivariate analysis children having dogs at home were healthier ie had fewer respiratory tract symptoms or infections than children with no dog contacts adjusted odds ratio aor 131 95 confidence interval ci 113152furthermore children having dog contacts at home had less frequent otitis aor 056 95 ci 038081 and tended to need fewer courses of antibiotics aor 071 95 ci 052096 than children without such contactsin univariate analysis both the weekly amount of contact with dogs and cats and the average yearly amount of contact were associated with decreased respiratory infectious disease morbidityconclusions these results suggest that dog contacts may have a protective effect on respiratory tract infections during the first year of lifeour findings support the theory that during the first year of life animal contacts are important possibly leading to better resistance to infectious respiratory illnesses during childhood
