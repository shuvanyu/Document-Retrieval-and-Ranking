background currently there is a lack of clarity in the literature as to whether there is a definitive difference between the effects of vitamins d2 and d3 in the raising of serum 25hydroxyvitamin d 25ohdobjective the objective of this article was to report a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials rcts that have directly compared the effects of vitamin d2 and vitamin d3 on serum 25ohd concentrations in humansdesign the isi web of knowledge january 1966 to july 2011 database was searched electronically for all relevant studies in adults that directly compared vitamin d3 with vitamin d2the cochrane clinical trials registry international standard randomized controlled trials number register and clinicaltrialsgov were also searched for any unpublished trialsresults a metaanalysis of rcts indicated that supplementation with vitamin d3 had a significant and positive effect in the raising of serum 25ohd concentrations compared with the effect of vitamin d2 p  0001when the frequency of dosage administration was compared there was a significant response for vitamin d3 when given as a bolus dose p  00002 compared with administration of vitamin d2 but the effect was lost with daily supplementationconclusions this metaanalysis indicates that vitamin d3 is more efficacious at raising serum 25ohd concentrations than is vitamin d2 and thus vitamin d3 could potentially become the preferred choice for supplementationhowever additional research is required to examine the metabolic pathways involved in oral and intramuscular administration of vitamin d and the effects across age sex and ethnicity which this review was unable to verify
