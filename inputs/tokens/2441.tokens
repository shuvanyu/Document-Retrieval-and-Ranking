the effects of dietary supplementation with coconut oil on the biochemical and anthropometric profiles of women presenting waist circumferences wc 88 cm abdominal obesity were investigatedthe randomised doubleblind clinical trial involved 40 women aged 2040 yearsgroups received daily dietary supplements comprising 30 ml of either soy bean oil group s n  20 or coconut oil group c n  20 over a 12week period during which all subjects were instructed to follow a balanced hypocaloric diet and to walk for 50 min per daydata were collected 1 week before t1 and 1 week after t2 dietary interventionenergy intake and amount of carbohydrate ingested by both groups diminished over the trial whereas the consumption of protein and fibre increased and lipid ingestion remained unchangedat t1 there were no differences in biochemical or anthropometric characteristics between the groups whereas at t2 group c presented a higher level of hdl 487  24 vs 4500  56 p  001 and a lower ldlhdl ratio 241  08 vs 31  08 p  004reductions in bmi were observed in both groups at t2 p  005 but only group c exhibited a reduction in wc p  0005group s presented an increase p  005 in total cholesterol ldl and ldlhdl ratio whilst hdl diminished p  003such alterations were not observed in group c it appears that dietetic supplementation with coconut oil does not cause dyslipidemia and seems to promote a reduction in abdominal obesity
