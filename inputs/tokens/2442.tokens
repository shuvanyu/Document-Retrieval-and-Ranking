evidence suggests that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats facilitate greater absorption of carotenoids than saturated fatshowever the comparison of consuming a polyunsaturated fat source versus a saturated fat source on tomato carotenoid bioaccumulation has not been examinedthe goal of this study was to determine the influence of coconut oil and safflower oil on tomato carotenoid tissue accumulation in mongolian gerbils  meriones unguiculatus  fed a 20 fat dietcoconut oil feeding increased carotenoid concentrations among many compartments including total carotenoids in the serum p  00003 adrenal glandular phytoene p  004 hepatic phytofluene p  00001 testicular alltranslycopene p  001 and cislycopene p  0006 in the prostateseminal vesicle complex compared to safflower oilsafflower oilfed gerbils had greater splenic lycopene concentrations p  0006 compared to coconut oilfed gerbilscoconut oil feeding increased serum cholesterol p  00001 and decreased hepatic cholesterol p  00003 compared to safflower oilin summary coconut oil enhanced tissue uptake of tomato carotenoids to a greater degree than safflower oilthese results may have been due to the large proportion of mediumchain fatty acids in coconut oil which might have caused a shift in cholesterol flux to favor extrahepatic carotenoid tissue deposition
