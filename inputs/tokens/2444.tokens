background dietary fat type is known to modulate the plasma lipid profile but its effects on plasma homocysteine and inflammatory markers are unclearobjective we investigated the effects of highprotein malaysian diets prepared with palm olein coconut oil co or virgin olive oil on plasma homocysteine and selected markers of inflammation and cardiovascular disease cvd in healthy adultsdesign a randomizedcrossover intervention with 3 dietary sequences of 5 wk each was conducted in 45 healthy subjectsthe 3 test fats namely palmitic acid 160rich palm olein po lauric and myristic acid 120  140rich co and oleic acid 181rich virgin olive oil oo were incorporated at twothirds of 30 fat calories into highprotein malaysian dietsresults no significant differences were observed in the effects of the 3 diets on plasma total homocysteine thcy and the inflammatory markers tnfα il1β il6 and il8 highsensitivity creactive protein and interferonγdiets prepared with po and oo had comparable nonhypercholesterolemic effects the postprandial total cholesterol for both diets and all fasting lipid indexes for the oo diet were significantly lower p  005 than for the co dietunlike the po and oo diets the co diet was shown to decrease postprandial lipoproteinaconclusion diets that were rich in saturated fatty acids prepared with either po or co and an oo diet that was high in oleic acid did not alter postprandial or fasting plasma concentrations of thcy and selected inflammatory markersthis trial was registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct00941837
