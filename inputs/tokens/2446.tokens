objective the purpose of this study was to determine whether periodontal disease is associated with endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammationepidemiological studies suggest that severe periodontal disease is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk but the mechanisms remain unknownmethods and results we assessed flowmediated dilation and nitroglycerinmediated dilation of the brachial artery using vascular ultrasound in 26 subjects with advanced periodontal disease and 29 control subjectsthe groups were matched for age and sex and patients with hypercholesterolemia diabetes mellitus hypertension and history of cigarette smoking were excludedwe also examined serum levels of creactive protein using an established highsensitivity methodsubjects with advanced periodontal disease had lower flowmediated dilation compared with control patients 7846 versus 11753 p0005nitroglycerinmediated dilation was equivalent in the two groupssubjects with advanced periodontitis exhibited higher serum levels of highsensitivity creactive protein compared with healthy controls patients 2323 versus 1010 mgl p003conclusions subjects with advanced periodontal disease exhibit endothelial dysfunction and evidence of systemic inflammation possibly placing them at increased risk for cardiovascular disease
