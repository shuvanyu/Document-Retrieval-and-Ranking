background the dental care setting is an appropriate place to deliver dietary assessment and advice as part of patient managementhowever we do not know whether this is effective in changing dietary behaviourobjectives to assess the effectiveness of onetoone dietary interventions for all ages carried out in a dental care setting in changing dietary behaviourthe effectiveness of these interventions in the subsequent changing of oral and general health is also assessedsearch methods the following electronic databases were searched the cochrane oral health group trials register to 24 january 2012 the cochrane central register of controlled trials central the cochrane library 2012 issue 1 medline via ovid 1950 to 24 january 2012 embase via ovid 1980 to 24 january 2012 cinahl via ebsco 1982 to 24 january 2012 psycinfo via ovid 1967 to 24 january 2012 and web of science 1945 to 12 april 2011we also undertook an electronic search of key conference proceedings iadr and orca between 2000 and 13 july 2011reference lists of relevant articles thesis publications dissertations s online 1861 to 2011 were searchedthe authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify any unpublished workselection criteria randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of onetoone dietary interventions delivered in a dental care settingdata collection and analysis  screening eligibility screening and data extraction decisions were all carried out independently and in duplicate by two review authorsconsensus between the two opinions was achieved by discussion or involvement of a third review authormain results five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the reviewtwo of these were multiintervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention but where data on dietary behaviour change were reportedone of the single intervention studies was concerned with dental caries preventionthe other two concerned general health outcomesthere were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosionin four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variablesauthors conclusions there is some evidence that onetoone dietary interventions in the dental setting can change behaviour although the evidence is greater for interventions aiming to change fruitvegetable and alcohol consumption than for those aiming to change dietary sugar consumptionthere is a need for more studies particularly in the dental practice setting as well as greater methodological rigour in the design statistical analysis and reporting of such studies
