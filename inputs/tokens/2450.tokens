we reviewed data from six cohort studies and approximately 40 casecontrol studies on the relation between selected aspects of diet and the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancerfruit and vegetables were inversely related to the risk the pooled relative risk rr for high vegetable consumption was 065 from three cohort studies on upper aerodigestive tract cancers and 052 from 18 casecontrol studies of oral and pharyngeal cancer corresponding rrs for high fruit consumption were 078 and 055 betacarotene vitamin c and selected flavonoids have been inversely related to the risk but it is difficult to disentangle their potential effect from that of fruit and vegetableswhole grain but not refined grain intake was also favorably related to oral cancer riskthe results were not consistent with reference to other foods beverages and nutrients but it is now possible to exclude a strong relation between these foods and oral and pharyngeal cancer riskin western countries selected aspects of diet may account for 2025 of oral and pharyngeal cancer and the population attributable risk increases to 8595 when tobacco and alcohol consumption are also considered
