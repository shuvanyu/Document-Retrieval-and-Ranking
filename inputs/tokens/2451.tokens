excessive consumption of acidic drinks and foods contributes to tooth erosionthe aims of the present in vitro study were twofold 1 to assess the erosive potential of different dietary substances and medications 2 to determine the chemical properties with an impact on the erosive potentialwe selected sixty agents soft drinks an energy drink sports drinks alcoholic drinks juice fruit mineral water yogurt tea coffee salad dressing and medicationsthe erosive potential of the tested agents was quantified as the changes in surface hardness δsh of enamel specimens within the first 2 min δsh20  sh2 min  shbaseline and the second 2 min exposure δsh42  sh4 min  sh2 minto characterise these agents various chemical properties egph concentrations of ca pi and f titratable acidity to ph 70 and buffering capacity at the original ph value β as well as degree of saturation pk  pi with respect to hydroxyapatite hap and fluorapatite fap were determinederosive challenge caused a statistically significant reduction in sh for all agents except for coffee some medications and alcoholic drinks and nonflavoured mineral waters teas and yogurts p  001by multiple linear regression analysis 52  of the variation in δsh after 2 min and 61  after 4 min immersion were explained by ph β and concentrations of f and ca p  005ph was the variable with the highest impact in multiple regression and bivariate correlation analysesfurthermore a high bivariate correlation was also obtained between pk  pihap pk  pifap and δsh
