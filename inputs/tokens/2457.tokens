introduction high lowdensity lipoproteins ldl cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseasein recent years some evidence has been presented that periodontitis an infectious inflammatory condition of the periodontium is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseaseto further elucidate this association we have studied the levels of ldl cholesterol a known risk marker for cardiovascular disease in a periodontallydiseased groupmethods the levels of serum ldl cholesterol in 47 subjects with mild to severe clinical attachment loss equal to or greater than 1 mm chronic generalized at least 30 of teeth affected periodontitis with the mean age of 4221  146 years were measured and compared with those obtained from 42 age 3983  094 and sex matched controlsboth groups were free from systemic illnessesresults the mean serum ldl cholesterol in periodontitis patients was found to be significantly higher p  0001 as compared to that of the controlsthe mean clinical attachment loss was positively correlated with serum ldl cholesterol p  001 and gingival index p005the frequency of persons with pathologic values of ldl cholesterol was significantly higher in periodontitis patients compared with that of the controlsconclusions these results showed that high serum ldl cholesterol may be associated with periodontitis in healthy peoplehowever it is unclear whether periodontitis causes an increase in the levels of serum ldl or an increased ldl is a risk factor for both periodontitis and cardiovascular disease
