oral health is related to diet in many ways for example nutritional influences on craniofacial development oral cancer and oral infectious diseasesdental diseases impact considerably on selfesteem and quality of life and are expensive to treatthe objective of this paper is to review the evidence for an association between nutrition diet and dental diseases and to present dietary recommendations for their preventionnutrition affects the teeth during development and malnutrition may exacerbate periodontal and oral infectious diseaseshowever the most significant effect of nutrition on teeth is the local action of diet in the mouth on the development of dental caries and enamel erosiondental erosion is increasing and is associated with dietary acids a major source of which is soft drinksdespite improved trends in levels of dental caries in developed countries dental caries remains prevalent and is increasing in some developing countries undergoing nutrition transitionthere is convincing evidence collectively from human intervention studies epidemiological studies animal studies and experimental studies for an association between the amount and frequency of free sugars intake and dental cariesalthough other fermentable carbohydrates may not be totally blameless epidemiological studies show that consumption of starchy staple foods and fresh fruit are associated with low levels of dental cariesfluoride reduces caries risk but has not eliminated dental caries and many countries do not have adequate exposure to fluorideit is important that countries with a low intake of free sugars do not increase intake as the available evidence shows that when free sugars consumption is 1520 kgyr  approximately 610 energy intake dental caries is lowfor countries with high consumption levels it is recommended that national health authorities and decisionmakers formulate countryspecific and communityspecific goals for reducing the amount of free sugars aiming towards the recommended maximum of no more than 10 of energy intakein addition the frequency of consumption of foods containing free sugars should be limited to a maximum of 4 times per dayit is the responsibility of national authorities to ensure implementation of feasible fluoride programmes for their country
