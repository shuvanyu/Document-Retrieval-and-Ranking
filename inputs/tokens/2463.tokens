in the present study 21 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah congeners were measured in the exhaust stack of 3 types of restaurants 9 chinese 7 western and 4 barbeque bbqthe total pah concentration of bbq restaurants 5881  2389 μg m3 was significantly higher than that of chinese 2099  1367 μg m3 and western 2147  1144 μg m3 restaurantsthe total benzoapyrene potency equivalent bapeq concentrations however were highest in chinese restaurants 182  224 μg m3 followed by western 086  143 μg m3 p001 and bbqtype restaurants 059  055 μg m3 p001we further developed a probabilistic risk model to assess the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr for people exposed to carcinogenic pahsbecause the exhaust stack directly affected the backdoor neighbors of these restaurants we were concerned with the real exposure of groups near the exhaust stack outlets of these restaurantsthe ilcrs for total exposure of the neighbors inhalationdermal contactingestion were 26313 15148 and 13122  106 in chinese western and bbq restaurants respectivelywe suggest that the maximum acceptable exposure time to the exhaust stack outlet area for chinese western and bbq restaurants ranges between 519 1742 and 1856 h month1 respectively based on an ilcr of less than 106crown copyright  2011published by elsevier bv all rights reserved
