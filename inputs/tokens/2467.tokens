more than 85 of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to longterm exposure to environmental carcinogens such as those in the diet through a multistep disease process progressing from noncancerous to premalignant and malignant stagesthe chemical carcinogen 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip is one of the most abundant heterocyclic amines found in hightemperature cooked meats and is recognized as a mammary carcinogenhowever the phips mechanism of action in breast cell carcinogenesis is not clearhere we demonstrated for the first time that cumulative exposures to phip at physiologically achievable pico to nanomolar concentrations effectively induced progressive carcinogenesis of human breast epithelial mcf10a cells from a noncancerous stage to premalignant and malignant stages in a dose and exposuredependent mannerprogressive carcinogenesis was measured by increasingly acquired cancerassociated properties of reduced dependence on growth factors anchorageindependent growth acinarconformational disruption proliferation migration invasion tumorigenicity with metastasis and increased stemlike cell populationsthese biological changes were accompanied by biochemical and molecular changes including upregulated hras gene expression extracellular signalregulated kinase erk pathway activation nox1 expression reactive oxygen species ros elevation increased hif1α sp1 tumor necrosis factorα matrix metalloproteinase mmp2 mmp9 aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and reduced ecadherinthe raserknoxros pathway played an important role in not only initiation but also maintenance of cellular carcinogenesis induced by phipusing biological biochemical and molecular changes as targeted endpoints we identified that the green tea catechin components epicatechin3gallate and epigallocatechin3gallate at noncytotoxic doses were capable of suppressing phipinduced cellular carcinogenesis and tumorigenicity
