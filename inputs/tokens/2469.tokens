the food mutagens iq 2amino3methylimidazo45fquinoline and phip 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine are heterocyclic amines hca generated when heating proteinaceous foodthis study investigates the protective potential of the flavonoids quercetin q and rutin r against oxidative stress induced in vitro by iq and phip in lymphocytes from healthy individuals and untreated newly diagnosed colon cancer patients using the comet assayin the presence of up to 500μm q and r the dna damage resulting from a high dose of phip 75μm or iq 150μm was significantly reduced p0001 to levels comparable to six times lower iq or 75 times lower phip doseslymphocytes from colon cancer patients had greater baseline dna damage than those from healthy individuals p001 and this higher level of damage was also observed throughout in vitro treatmentexcept for the 50years of age group and male gender confounding factors such as smoking drinking andor dietary habits were not found to be significantin conclusion flavonoids reduced oxidative stress caused by food mutagens in vitro in lymphocytes of healthy individuals and colon cancer patientsthus dietary supplementation with flavonoidrich vegetables and fruits may prove very effective in protecting against oxidative stresscopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
