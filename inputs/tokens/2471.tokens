heterocyclic amines hcas are formed when meat products such as beef chicken pork and fish are cooked at high temperaturesthe most abundant hca found in the human diet is 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45b pyridine phipphip causes mammary carcinomas in female rats and mice and is associated with an increased risk of developing colon breast and prostate cancer in humansphip is metabolized by cytochrome p450s producing nohphipthe nohphip can be esterified by phase ii enzymes forming an arylnitrenium ion that binds to dna causing adductsfurthermore nohphip may be reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase producing superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals causing dna strand breaksdiallyl sulfide das has been shown to prevent cancer in several animal models presumably by metabolic modulationwe hypothesize that phip produces reactive oxygen species causing dna strand breaks and that das will inhibit the formation of phip induced dna strand breaksto test this hypothesis we treated normal breast epithelial mcf10a cells with phip das and a combination of phip and dasthe detection of lipid peroxides was used as a surrogate for roslipid peroxides were detected using a peroxidetect kit sigmaphip increased the production of lipid peroxides and das decreased the phipinduced peroxidation by 47to determine if phip causes dna strand breaks in mcf10a cells cells were treated for 3 6 9 and 24 h with phip 100 microm das 100 microm and a combination of phip 100 microm and das 100 micromdna strand breaks were evaluated using the comet assayphip produced dna strand breaks in a dose and timedependent fashionwe have shown that das inhibits phipinduced dna strand breaks by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen speciestherefore we propose that das can prevent phipinduced breast cancer
