a facile method was established to measure heterocyclic aromatic amines haas accumulated in human hair and rodent furthe samples were digested by base hydrolysis and the liberated haas were isolated by tandem solventsolidphase extractionquantification was done by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry using a triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer in the selected reaction monitoring modein a pilot study of 12 human volunteers 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip was detected in hair of six meateaters at levels ranging from 290 to 890 pgg hair2amino38dimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline meiqx and 2amino9hpyrido23bindole aαc were below the limit of quantification loq 50 pgg hair in hair from meateaters and six vegetariansphip was detected in the hair from one vegetarian and at level just above the loq 65 pgg hair indicating phip exposure occurs primarily through meat consumptionthe levels of phip in hair samples from two meateaters varied by less than 24 over a 6month interval signifying that the exposure to phip and its accumulation in hair are relatively constant over timein a controlled feeding study female c57bl6 mice were given these haas in their drinking water for 1 month at six daily dose concentrations ranging from 0 0080 to 800 µgkg body weightphip was detected in fur of mice at all doses whereas aαc and meiqx were detected in fur at dosages 08 µg aαckg body weight and 8 µg meiqxkg body weightthere was a strong positive relationship between dosage and each of the haas accumulated in fur and their dna adducts formed in liver and colon pvalues 00001 however the levels of haa in fur did not correlate to the levels of dna adducts after adjustment of dosethus hair appears to be a promising longlived biomarker with by which we can assess the exposure to phip a potential human carcinogen
