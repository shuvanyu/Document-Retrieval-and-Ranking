2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip is the most abundant heterocyclic amine formed in meat and fish during cooking and can be used as a model compound for this class of chemicals possibly involved in human carcinogenesisknowing the exposure to heterocyclic amines is important for establishing their role in human diseasesserum albumin sa and globin gb adducts were first tested as biomarkers of exposure to phip in male fischer 344 rats given oral doses of 01 05 1 and 10 mgkgblood samples were collected 24 hr after treatment and phip released from sa and gb after acidic hydrolysis was analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry or liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometryphipsa and gb adducts increased linearly with the dosestudies on 35 volunteers with different dietary habits exhibited that diet was a major determinant in the formation of both adductsphipsa adducts were significantly higher in meat consumers than in vegetarians 67  16 and 07  03 fmolmg sa respectively mean  se p  004 mannwhitney u testthe gb adduct pattern was quantitatively lower but paralleled sa 3  08 in meat consumers and 03  01 in vegetariansphipsa adducts were no different in smokers and in nonsmokersthe results show for the first time that phipblood protein adducts are present in humans not given the synthetic compoundboth biomarkers appear to be suitable for assessing dietary exposure and internal phip dose and may be promising tools for studying the role of heterocyclic amines in the etiology of colon cancer and other diseasescopyright 2000 wileyliss inc
