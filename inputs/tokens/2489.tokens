the influence of a 3week vegetarian diet and fasting on serum concentration of peroxides lipids apolipoproteins and plasma fibrinogen was studied in ten middleaged fibromyalgiafibrositis patients eight women two menmean serum peroxide concentration estimated as thiobarbituric acid reacting substances was reduced from 360  014 to 282  015 umoll p  001 and plasma fibrinogen from 333  025 to 274  015 gl p  002serum total cholesterol fell from 661  050 to 483  035 mmoll p  00001 apolipoprotein b from 177  014 to 131  011 gl p  00001 and apolipoprotein a from 141  009 to 123  005 gl p  003high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration also decreased somewhat from 126  009 to 107  004 mmoll p  003 an atherogenic index reflecting the balance between low and high density lipoproteins was reduced by 31 from 574  079 to 397  060 p  002the results suggest that vegetarian dietfasting may have a beneficial influence on the concentration of serum peroxides and plasma fibrinogen concentration and on the serum level of several lipoproteinrelated coronary risk factors
