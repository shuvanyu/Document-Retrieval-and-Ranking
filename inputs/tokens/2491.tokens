apple peel is a waste product from dried apple manufacturethe content of phenolic compounds dietary fiber and mineral are higher in apple peel compared to other edible parts of this fruitsthe objective of this study was to develop an ingredient from granny smith apple peel using a pilot scale double drumdryer as drying technologythe control of all steps to maximize the retention of phenolic compounds and dietary fiber was consideredoperational conditions such as drying temperature and time were determined as well as important preprocessing steps like grinding and ppo inhibitionin addition the physicalchemical characteristics mineral and sugar content and technological functional properties such as water retention capacity solubility index and dispersability among others were analyzeda simple economical and suitable pilot scale process to produce a powder ingredient from apple peel byproduct was obtainedthe drying process includes the application of ascorbic acid at 05 in the fresh apple peel slurry drumdryer operational conditions were 110 degrees c 015 rpm and 02 mm drum clearancethe ingredient developed could be considered as a source of phenolic compounds 386 mg gallic acid equivalentg dry base and dietary fiber 397 dry base in the formulation of foodspractical application a method to develop an ingredient from granny smith apple peel using a pilot scale double drumdryer as drying technology was developedthe method is simple economical feasible and suitable and maximizes the retention of phenolic compounds and dietary fiber present in the raw matterthe ingredient could be used in the formulation of foods
