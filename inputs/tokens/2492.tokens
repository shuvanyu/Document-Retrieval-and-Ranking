in this study six common tests for measuring antioxidant activity were evaluated by comparing four antioxidants and applying them to beverages tea and juices trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay teac iiii assay total radicaltrapping antioxidant parameter assay trap assay 22diphenyllpicrylhydrazyl assay dpph assay nndimethylpphenylendiamine assay dmpd assay photochemiluminescence assay pcl assay and ferric reducing ability of plasma assay frap assaythe antioxidants included gallic acid representing the group of polyphenols uric acid as the main antioxidant in human plasma ascorbic acid as a vitamin widely spread in fruits and trolox as water soluble vitamin e analoguethe six methods presented can be divided into two groups depending on the oxidising reagentfive methods use organic radical producers teac iiii trap dpph dmpd pcl and one method works with metal ions for oxidation frapanother difference between these tests is the reaction procedurethree assays use the delay in oxidation and determine the lag phase as parameter for the antioxidant activity teac i trap pclthey determine the delay of radical generation as well as the ability to scavenge the radicalin contrast the assays teac ii and iii dpph dmpd and frap analyse the ability to reduce the radical cation teac ii and iii dpph dmpd or the ferric ion frapthe three tests acting by radical reduction use preformed radicals and determine the decrease in absorbance while the frap assay measures the formed ferrous ions by increased absorbancegallic acid was the strongest antioxidant in all tests with exception of the dmpd assayin contrast uric acid and ascorbic acid showed low activity in some assaysmost of the assays determine the antioxidant activity in the micromolar range needing minutes to hoursonly one assay pcl is able to analyse the antioxidant activity in the nanomolar rangeblack currant juice showed highest antioxidant activity in all tests compared to tea apple juice and tomato juicedespite these differences results of these in vitro assays give an idea of the protective efficacy of secondary plant productsit is strongly recommended to use at least two methods due to the differences between the test systems investigated
