objective the association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular events has been documented in highrisk groups but is still undetermined in general populations especially chinesethis study assessed the temporal association between serum uric acid level hyperuricemia and cardiovascular mortalitymethods a prospective cohort study of 41879 men and 48514 women ages  or  35 years was conducted using data from the mj health screening centers in taiwanmortality from all causes total cardiovascular disease cvd ischemic stroke congestive heart failure hypertensive disease and coronary heart disease were compared according to increasing serum uric acid levelsresults a total of 1151 212 events of 5427 total deaths were ascribed to cvd mean followup 82 yearshazard ratios hrs for hyperuricemia serum uric acid level 7 mgdl were estimated with cox regression model after adjusting for age sex body mass index cholesterol triglycerides diabetes hypertension heavy cigarette smoking and frequent alcohol consumptionin all patients hrs were 116 p  0001 for allcause mortality 139 p  0001 for total cvd and 135 p  002 for ischemic strokein subgroup analysis the hrs for cardiovascular risk remained significant in patients with hypertension 144 p  0001 and in patients with diabetes 164 p  0001in addition in a low metabolic risk subgroup the hrs for allcause mortality and total cardiovascular morbidity were 124 p  002 and 148 p  016 respectivelyconclusion hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor of mortality from all causes total cvd and ischemic stroke in the taiwanese general population in highrisk groups and potentially in lowrisk groups
