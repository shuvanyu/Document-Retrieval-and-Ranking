objective a metaanalysis was performed on epidemiologic studies to assess the relation between βglucan consumption from oats and from barley on blood cholesterol level triglyceridetriacylglycerol tgltag level and blood glucose level bgl in humansin addition the effect of βglucan on total cholesterol tc and bgl was translated into an empirical doseresponse modelmethods thirty research articles that evaluated the effect of different exposure levels of βglucan on blood cholesterol and bgl were analyzed yielding 126 clinical studiesresults there was a significant inverse relation in tc 060 mmoll 95 confidence interval ci 085 to 034 lowdensity lipoprotein 066 mmoll 95 ci 096 to 036 and tgltag 004 mmoll 95 ci 015 to 007 after consumption of βglucanin contrast an increase in highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol was noted 003 mmoll 95 ci 006 to 013 with the randomeffect modelthe analysis showed a significant change in bgl 258 mmoll 95 ci 322 to 184 with high heterogeneity between i2  97 and across τ2  588 the studiesthe fixedeffect model showed a significant change in tc lowdensity lipoprotein and bgl whereas it showed no significant changes in highdensity lipoprotein and tgltagthe doseresponse model showed that a 3gd dose of oat or barley βglucan was sufficient to decrease tcconclusion consumption of 3 gd of oat or barley βglucan is sufficient to decrease blood cholesterol whereas the effect on bgl is still inconclusive with high heterogeneity and requires further clinical research studies with longer intervention periodscopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
