objectives the objective of this study was to assess the relation between the level of habitual potassium intake and the incidence of cardiovascular disease cvdbackground prospective cohort studies have evaluated the relationship between habitual potassium intake and incidence of vascular disease but their results have not been not entirely consistentmethods we performed a systematic search for prospective studies published without language restrictions 1966 to december 2009criteria for inclusion were prospective adult population study assessment of baseline potassium intake assessment of vascular events as outcome and followup of at least 4 yearsfor each study relative risks rrs and 95 confidence intervals cis were extracted and pooled using a randomeffect model weighted for the inverse of the varianceheterogeneity publication bias subgroup and metaregression analyses were performedresults eleven studies were identified providing 15 cohort samples that included 247510 male and female participants followup 5 to 19 years 7066 strokes 3058 coronary heart disease chd events and 2497 total cvd eventspotassium intake was assessed by 24h dietary recall n  2 food frequency questionnaire n  6 or 24h urinary excretion n  3in the pooled analysis a 164g 42 mmol per day higher potassium intake was associated with a 21 lower risk of stroke rr 079 95 ci 068 to 090 p  00007 with a trend toward lower risk of chd and total cvd that attained statistical significance after the exclusion of a single cohort based on sensitivity analysis rr 093 95 ci 087 to 099 p  003 and rr 074 95 ci 060 to 091 p  00037conclusions higher dietary potassium intake is associated with lower rates of stroke and might also reduce the risk of chd and total cvdthese results support recommendations for higher consumption of potassiumrich foods to prevent vascular diseasescopyright  2011 american college of cardiology foundationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
