clonal deletion is arguably the most important mechanism of eliminating selfreactive thymocytes from the tcell repertoirerecent work has identified new players in this processon the thymocyte side several molecules have been newly implicated in the pathway from initial tcell receptor signaling through to the final result gene transcription and thymocyte apoptosisin addition several proapoptotic molecules have been found to be necessary for the death of selfreactive thymocyteson the antigenpresenting cell side the expression of peripheral selfantigens regulated at least in part by the autoimmune regulator aire protein is crucial for complete elimination of autoreactive thymocytesthe importance of thymic peripheral antigen expression and clonal deletion to selftolerance is demonstrated in the autoimmune diseases autoimmunepolyendocrinopathycandidiasisectodermal dystrophy and type1 diabetes mellitus
