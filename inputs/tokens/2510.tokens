induced apoptosis of autoreactive tlymphocyte precursors in the thymus is crucial for the prevention of autoimmune disordersigfi and prolactin which are lymphocyte growth factors may have the potential to suppress apoptosis in thymocytes and thus encourage autoimmunity conversely dietary fish oil rich in omega3 fats appears to upregulate apoptosis in lymphocytessince wholefood vegan diets may downregulate systemic igfi activity it is proposed that such a diet in conjunction with fish oil supplementation and treatment with dopamine agonists capable of suppressing prolactin secretion may have utility for treating and preventing autoimmune disordersthis prediction is consistent with the extreme rarity of autoimmune disorders among subsaharan black africans as long as they followed their traditional quasivegan lifestyles and with recent ecologic studies correlating risks for iddm and for multiple sclerosis mortality with animal product andor saturated fat consumptionmoreover there is evidence that vegan or quasivegan diets are useful in the management of rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis and possibly slethe dopamine agonist bromocryptine exerts antiinflammatory effects in rodent models of autoimmunity and there is preliminary evidence that this drug may be clinically useful in several human autoimmune diseases better tolerated d2specific agonists such as cabergoline may prove to be more practical for use in therapythe moderate clinical utility of supplemental fish oil in rheumatoid arthritis and certain other autoimmune disorders is documentedit is not unlikely that extrathymic antiinflammatory effects contribute importantly to the clinical utility of vegan diets bromocryptine and fish oil in autoimmunitythe favorable impact of low latitude or high altitude on autoimmune risk may be mediated by superior vitamin d status which is associated with decreased secretion of parathyroid hormone there are theoretical grounds for suspecting that parathyroid hormone may inhibit apoptosis in thymocytesandrogens appear to upregulate thymocyte apoptosis may be largely responsible for the relative protection from autoimmunity enjoyed by men and merit further evaluation for the management of autoimmunity in womenit will probably prove more practical to prevent autoimmune disorders than to reverse them once established a wholefood vegan diet coupled with fish oil and vitamin d supplementation may represent a practical strategy for achieving this prevention while concurrently lowering risk for many other lifethreatening western diseasescopyright 2001 harcourt publishers ltd
