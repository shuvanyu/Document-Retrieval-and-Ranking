breast cancer is a complex diseaseits aetiology is multifactorial its period of development can span decades and its clinical course is highly variableevaluation of the role of the immune response in either the development or control of breast cancer is also complexnevertheless there is substantial information that in this disease the immune response is not a host defence reaction and may even serve to facilitate cancer developmentthis evidence comes from a variety of sources including clinicalpathological investigations in women that show a correlation between the intensity of lymphocytic infiltration into the tumour mass with poor prognosis studies in breast cancer patients that demonstrate a similar correlation between delayed hypersensitivity reactivity or in vitro assays of immune reactivity to tumour cell membranes or nonspecific antigens and poor prognosis and analyses of cancer incidence in chronically immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients who develop an unexpectedly low incidence of breast cancerthe overall conclusions from these human studies are corroborated by observations in mouse mammary tumour models that also demonstrate immune enhancement of breast cell proliferation in vitro and of breast cancer development in vivopotential mechanisms for these effects include production by inflammatory cell infiltrates of direct or indirect modulators of breast cell growth egcytokines peptide or steroid hormones enzymes involved in steroid metabolism as well as of antibodies to growth factors or their receptorsthese immune facilitatory mechanisms must be overcome if immunebased therapies are to be applied successfully in breast cancer
