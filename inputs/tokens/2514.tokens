the objective of this case series and literature review is to characterize the clinical course and prognosis of hivinfected patients with kaposis sarcoma ks flare during immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome iris a heterogeneous and sometimes fatal disorder of immune perturbation after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy haartmedical records of 9 hivinfected patients with ks flare after virologic and immunologic response to haart were reviewed from a single institutionan additional 10 cases were abstracted by computerized search of the medical literaturein our single institution series mean time to onset of ks flare was 5 weekspretreatment mean cd4 count was 190 cellsmm3 and mean hiv viral load was 153934 copies per milliliterduring flare mean cd4 count was 256 cellsmm3 and mean hiv viral load was 1156 copies per millilitersimilar aggregate results are represented in the literaturesix fatalities are reported 4 from pulmonary ks and 2 from unrelated causessystemic chemotherapy universally led to tumor regression but was administered in only 10 of 19 casesin no instance was haart discontinuedonset of irisassociated ks flare is observed as early as 3 weeks with most cases diagnosed within 2 months after immunologic and virologic response to haartsuch a flare does not necessarily portend a poor prognosiseven for those patients with rapidly symptomatic ks early systemic chemotherapy is effective in suppressing irisassociated flareclose clinical supervision is warranted for the ks patient initiating changing or resuming haartparticular vigilance is recommended for pulmonary involvement
