animal models suggest that sucrose activates taste afferents differently than noncaloric sweetenerslittle information exists how artificial sweeteners engage central taste pathways in the human brainwe assessed sucrose and sucralose taste pleasantness across a concentration gradient in 12 healthy control women and applied 10 sucrose and matched sucralose during functional magnet resonance imagingthe results indicate that 1 both sucrose and sucralose activate functionally connected primary taste pathways 2 taste pleasantness predicts left insula response 3 sucrose elicits a stronger brain response in the anterior insula frontal operculum striatum and anterior cingulate compared to sucralose 4 only sucrose but not sucralose stimulation engages dopaminergic midbrain areas in relation to the behavioral pleasantness responsethus brain response distinguishes the caloric from the noncaloric sweetener although the conscious mind could notthis could have important implications on how effective artificial sweeteners are in their ability to substitute sugar intake
