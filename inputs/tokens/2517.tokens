the present study investigated the feasibility of a new experimental approach for studying the effect of covert nutritive dilution on the spontaneous food intake of obese individualseight obese subjects were studied as inpatients on a metabolic unit for 15 days during which time they were unaware that their food intake was being monitoreda platter method of food presentation encouraged ad libitum ingestioncaloric dilution was achieved by replacing sucrosecontaining products with aspartamesweetened analogues in an otherwise normal dietduring the baseline period the subjects spontaneously ate sufficient conventional food to maintain or even slightly increase body weightcovert substitution of aspartamesweetened products for their sucrose counterparts resulted in an immediate reduction in spontaneous energy intake of approximately 25the aspartame analogues were as well accepted as their conventional counterparts as indicated by the equal quantity of each consumedthese preliminary results demonstrate that in a metabolic ward setting it is possible to maintain the spontaneous food intake of obese individuals at levels sufficient to preserve body weight and arbitrarily to decrease those levels of intake by 25 or more through covert changes in the caloric density of the diet
