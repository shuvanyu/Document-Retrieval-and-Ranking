objective hyperglycemia oxidative stress and the onset and progression of diabetic complications are strongly linkedreduction of oxidative stress could be of utmost importance in the longterm treatment of diabetic patientsthe chronic nature of the disease calls for a mode of antioxidant intake that can be sustained easily eg by the dieterythritol a simple polyol could be such a compoundit is orally available well tolerated and its chemical structure resembles that of mannitol a wellknown hydroxyl radical ho scavengermethods we studied the antioxidant properties of erythritol in vitro and subsequently determined its antioxidant activity and its vasoprotective effect in the streptozotocin diabetic ratresults erythritol was shown to be an excellent ho radical scavenger and an inhibitor of 22azobis2amidinopropane dihydrochlorideinduced hemolysis but inert toward superoxide radicalshighperformance liquid chromatographic and electron spin resonance spectroscopy studies showed that the reaction of erythritol with hydroxyl radicals resulted in the formation of erythrose and erythrulose by abstraction of a carbonbound hydrogen atomin the streptozotocin diabetic rat erythritol displayed an endotheliumprotective effect and in accordance with the in vitro experiments erythrose was found in the urine of erythritolconsuming ratsconclusion erythritol acts as an antioxidant in vivo and may help protect against hyperglycemiainduced vascular damagecopyright 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
