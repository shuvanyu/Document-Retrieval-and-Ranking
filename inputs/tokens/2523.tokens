pigs are considered as a major reservoir of human pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and a source of human yersiniosishowever the transmission route of y enterocolitica from farm to pork is still unclearthe transmission of pathogenic y enterocolitica from pigs to carcasses and pluck sets was investigated by collecting samples from 364 individual eartagged pigs on the farm and at the slaughterhousein addition isolated strains were analyzed using pulsedfield gel electrophoresisisolation of similar genotypes of pathogenic y enterocolitica 4o3 in animals on the farm and at the slaughterhouse and in carcasses shows that carcass contamination originates from the strains a pig carries during the fattening perioddirect contamination from the carrier pig to its subsequent pluck set is also the primary contamination route for pluck sets but crosscontamination appears to have a larger impact on pluck set contamination than on carcassesin this study the withinfarm prevalence of pathogenic y enterocolitica varied from 0 to 100 indicating specific farm factors affect the prevalence of y enterocolitica in pigsthe association of farm factors with the high prevalence of pathogenic y enterocolitica on farms was studied for the first time using correlation and twolevel logistic regression analysesspecific farm factors iedrinking from a nipple absence of coarse feed or bedding for slaughter pigs and no access of pest animals to pig house were associated with a high prevalence of pathogenic y enterocolitica 4o3
