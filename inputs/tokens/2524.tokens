we investigated characteristics of yersinia enterocolitica infection in ontario finisher pig herdsour specific objectives were to estimate or test prevalence of y enterocolitica shedding in finisher pigs bioserotype distribution agreement between the herdlevel tests based on sampling pig and pooled fecal samples whether bioserotypes cluster by farms and whether y enterocoliticapositive herds cluster spatiallyin total 3747 fecal samples were collected from 100 farms over the years 2001 2002 and 2004 250 total herd visitsfecal samples were tested by culture and positive isolates were biotyped and serotypedapparent piglevel prevalence of y enterocolitica was 18 32 and 125 in 2001 2002 and 2004 respectivelyestimated true piglevel prevalence of y enterocolitica was 51 91 and 351 in 2001 2002 and 2004 respectivelyherdlevel prevalence was 163 179 and 375 in 2001 2002 and 2004 respectivelyin all years the most common bioserotype was 4 o3 followed by bioserotype 2 o527kappa between herdlevel status based on pig and pooled samples ranged between 051 and 068 for biotype 1a and bioserotype 4 o3 respectivelyfor 4 o3 a significant bias in discordant pairs was detected indicating that pig samples were more sensitive than pooled samples in declaring a herd as positivefarms tended to be repeatedly positive with the same bioserotype but positive study farms did not cluster spatially suggesting lack of between herd transmission and lack of a common geographic risk factorcopyright 2009 elsevier bv all rights reserved
