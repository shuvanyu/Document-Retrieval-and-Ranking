understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards across the food supply is critical for a riskbased national food safety systemthis study was conducted to estimate the us health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogenfood combinationsthese pathogens examined were campylobacter clostridium perfringens escherichia coli o157h7 listeria monocytogenes norovirus salmonella enterica toxoplasma gondii and all other foodnet pathogensthe health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of qualityadjusted life years qalys from acute and chronic illness and mortalitya new method for attributing illness to foods was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitationthis method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment thus outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attributionbased on evaluation of outbreak data expert elicitation and published scientific literature outbreakbased attribution estimates for campylobacter toxoplasma cryptosporidium and yersinia were determined not representative therefore expertbased attribution were included for these four pathogenssensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankingsdisease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogenfood combinationsthe top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over 8 billion and 36000 qalys or more than 50  of the total across all pairsacross all 14 pathogens poultry pork produce and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60  of the total cost of illness and loss of qalys
