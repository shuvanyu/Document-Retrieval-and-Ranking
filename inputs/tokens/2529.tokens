yersinia enterocolitica are ubiquitous being isolated frequently from soil water animals and a variety of foodsthey comprise a biochemically heterogeneous group that can survive and grow at refrigeration temperaturesthe ability to propagate at refrigeration temperatures is of considerable significance in food hygienevirulent strains of yersinia invade mammalian cells such as hela cells in tissue culturetwo chromosomal genes inv and ail were identified for cell invasion of mammalianthe pathogen can cause diarrhoea appendicitis and postinfection arthritis may occur in a small proportion of casesthe most common transmission route of pathogenic y enterocolitica is thought to be fecaloral via contaminated fooddirect persontoperson contact is rareoccasionally pathogenic y enterocolitica has been detected in vegetables and environmental water thus vegetables and untreated water are also potential sources of human yersiniosishowever the isolation rates of pathogenic y enterocolitica have been low which may be due to the limited sensitivity of the detection methodsto identify other possible transmission vehicles different food items should be studied more extensivelymany factors related to the epidemiology of y enterocolitica such as sources transmission routes and predominating genotypes remain obscure because of the low sensitivity of detection methods
