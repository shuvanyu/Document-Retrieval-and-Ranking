swine have been identified as the primary reservoir of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica ye but little research has focused on the epidemiology of ye at the farm levelthe objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of ye in different production phases on swine farmsin this crosssectional study individual pigs on eight swine operations were sampled for the presence of yeon each farm both feces and oralpharyngeal swabs were collected from pigs in five different production phases gestating farrowing suckling nursery and finishinga pig was considered positive if either sample tested positivesamples were cultured with cold enrichment followed by isolation on selective media platespresumptive isolates were confirmed as ye and assayed for the presence of ail with a multiplex pcrof the 2349 pigs sampled 120 51 tested positive and of those 51 were ail positive 425 of ye isolateson all farms there was a trend of increasing prevalence as pigs matureless than 1 of suckling piglets tested positive for yeonly 14 444 of which were ail positive of nursery pigs tested positive but 107 481 of which were ail positive of finishing pigs harbored yeinterestingly gestating sows had the second highest prevalence of ye at 91 267 of which were ail positive yet ye was never detected from the farrowing sowsthese results represent the first onfarm description of ye in us herds and provide the initial step for designing future studies of ye
