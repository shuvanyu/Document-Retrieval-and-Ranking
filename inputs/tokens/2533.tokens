pigs are the major animal reservoir for yersinia enterocolitica strains which are potentially pathogenic for humansthe goals of this study were i to estimate the individual animal and onfarm prevalences of y enterocolitica in hogs based on tonsil samples collected during national animal health monitoring system swine 2002 study and ii to use these data with data previously published for fecal samples to determine onfarm risk factors for y enterocoliticatonsil swabs 1218 and fecal samples 2847 were collected on 124 farms located in the top 17 porkproducing statesten percent of tonsils 122 of 1218 samples were positive in irgasantiracillinchlorate itc enrichment broth by realtime pcr but only 56 of samples 68 of 1218 were positive after subculture on the more selective cefsulodinirgasannovobiocin cin agarfor tonsils the onfarm prevalence based on realtime pcr detection of the ail gene in itc enrichment broth cultures was 32 32 of 100 premises sampled the prevalence based on subculture in cin agar was 196 20 of 102 premisesresults of bacteriological isolation and realtime pcr analysis of tonsils and feces were combined to estimate prevalence individual animal and farm which was subsequently correlated with 40 farm management practicesfour factors and their accompanying odds ratios ors were identified in the final regression model location in a central state or  03 vaccination for escherichia coli or  30 percentage of deaths due to scours or  35 and presence of meat or bone meal in growerfinisher diet or  41
