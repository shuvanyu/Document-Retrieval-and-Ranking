swine confinement buildings in eastern canada are enclosed and equipped with modern production systems to manage wastebioaerosols of these swine confinement buildings could be contaminated by human pathogens and antimicrobial resistant bacteria which could colonize exposed workerswe therefore wanted to analyze bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and nasal flora of canadian hog producers to evaluate possible colonization with human pathogens and tetracyclineresistant bacteriaculturable and nonculturable human pathogens and tet genes were investigated in the bioaerosols of 18 barnsthe nasal passages of 35 hog producers were sampled and total dna was extracted from the calciumalginate swabs to detect by pcr campylobacter c perfringens enterococcus e coli y enterocolitica tetatetc tetg and ribosomal protection protein genesairborne culturable c perfringens enterococcus e coli and y enterocolitica were present in the bioaerosols of 16 17 11 and 6 of the 18 facilitiesaerosolized total culturablenon culturable campylobacter c perfringens enterococcus e coli and y enterocolitica were detected in 10 6 15 18 and 2 barns respectivelytet genes were found in isolates of culturable human pathogenstetatetc tetg and ribosomal protection protein genes were detected in the bioaerosols of all 18 studied buildingscampylobacter c perfringens enterococcus e coli and y enterocolitica were found respectively in 4 9 17 14 and one nasal flora of workersone and 10 workers were positive for tetatetc and tetg genes respectivelyin swine confinement buildings hog producers are exposed to aerosolized human pathogens and tetracyclineresistant bacteria that can contaminate the nasal floracopyright  2010 elsevier gmbhall rights reserved
