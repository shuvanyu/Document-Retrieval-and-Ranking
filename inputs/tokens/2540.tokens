the objective was to summarize previous literature using a metaanalysis approach on the effects of ractopamine hydrochloride rac when fed at doses of 5 to 10 mgkg for up to 35 d before harvest on carcass cutability and belly quality of finishing pigsthe metaanalysis provided an opportunity to determine the consensus of previously published literatureten studies were evaluated to determine cutting yields and 8 studies were used to determine belly quality in this reviewpooled dietary rac concentrations 5 mgkg 74 mgkg 10 mgkg and stepup feeding programs and pooled feeding durations up to 35 d before harvest were compared with pigs not fed rac controls and were analyzed as a metaanalysis using the mixed procedure of sasractopamine inclusion was the fixed effect in the model and the individual study was considered a random variablethe only difference between rac and control pigs for whole primals as a percentage of side weight was the whole ham p  001no other differences were detected for whole primals as a percentage of side weightyet differences were detected in the standardized trimmed primal yieldsa difference p  005 in percentages of the side weight was detected for the boston butt trimmed loin and trimmed hamthis translated into rac pigs having a carcass cutting yield 7470 vs 7369 respectively p  002 sed  033 advantage of 101 units and a bone in lean cutting yield 6143 vs 6033 respectively p  003 sed  040 advantage of 110 units when compared with control pigsthe advantage in bonein cutability was a result of increased boneless sub primal yields in each of the lean cuts shoulder loin and hamwhen further evaluated rac pigs had a boneless shoulder boston butt  picnic yield advantage of 032 units p  001 sed  011 a 043 unit p  001 sed  013 yield advantage in the boneless loin canadian back  tenderloin  sirloin and a 051 unit p  0001 sed  011 advantage in the boneless ham inside  outside  knucklea boneless yield was calculated using a summation of the percentage of side weight from the boneless shoulder boneless loin and boneless ham which resulted in a 108 unit 3628 vs 3520 respectively p  0002 sed  025 advantage of rac pigs when compared with control pigsthere were no subprimal yield differences p  093 in the trimmed belly between rac pigs 1218 and control pigs 1218however rac pigs 1527 cm 7342 had narrower flop distances p  002 sed  062 and greater iodine values p  001 sed  033 respectively when compared with control pigs 1708 cm 7148
