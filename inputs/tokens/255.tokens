the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing dramatically as a result of the obesity epidemic and poses a major health and socioeconomic burdentype 2 diabetes develops in individuals who fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing pancreatic insulin secretionthis insulin deficiency results from pancreatic betacell dysfunction and deathwestern diets rich in saturated fats cause obesity and insulin resistance and increase levels of circulating nefas nonesterified free fatty acidsin addition they contribute to betacell failure in genetically predisposed individualsnefas cause betacell apoptosis and may thus contribute to progressive betacell loss in type 2 diabetesthe molecular pathways and regulators involved in nefamediated betacell dysfunction and apoptosis are beginning to be understoodwe have identified er endoplasmic reticulum stress as one of the molecular mechanisms implicated in nefainduced betacell apoptosiser stress was also proposed as a mechanism linking highfatdietinduced obesity with insulin resistancethis cellular stress response may thus be a common molecular pathway for the two main causes of type 2 diabetes namely insulin resistance and betacell lossa better understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to pancreatic betacell loss will pave the way for the development of novel and targeted approaches to prevent type 2 diabetes
