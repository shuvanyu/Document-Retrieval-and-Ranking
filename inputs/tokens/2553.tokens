context despite decades of accumulated observational evidence the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertainobjective to assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the united statesdesign estrogen plus progestin component of the womens health initiative a randomized controlled primary prevention trial planned duration 85 years in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 5079 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 us clinical centers in 19931998interventions participants received conjugated equine estrogens 0625 mgd plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 25 mgd in 1 tablet n  8506 or placebo n  8102main outcomes measures the primary outcome was coronary heart disease chd nonfatal myocardial infarction and chd death with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcomea global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke pulmonary embolism pe endometrial cancer colorectal cancer hip fracture and death due to other causesresults on may 31 2002 after a mean of 52 years of followup the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefitsthis report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through april 30 2002estimated hazard ratios hrs nominal 95 confidence intervals cis were as follows chd 129 102163 with 286 cases breast cancer 126 100159 with 290 cases stroke 141 107185 with 212 cases pe 213 139325 with 101 cases colorectal cancer 063 043092 with 112 cases endometrial cancer 083 047147 with 47 cases hip fracture 066 045098 with 106 cases and death due to other causes 092 074114 with 331 casescorresponding hrs nominal 95 cis for composite outcomes were 122 109136 for total cardiovascular disease arterial and venous disease 103 090117 for total cancer 076 069085 for combined fractures 098 082118 for total mortality and 115 103128 for the global indexabsolute excess risks per 10 000 personyears attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more chd events 8 more strokes 8 more pes and 8 more invasive breast cancers while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 personyears were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fracturesthe absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 personyearsconclusions overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 52year followup among healthy postmenopausal us womenallcause mortality was not affected during the trialthe riskbenefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of chd
