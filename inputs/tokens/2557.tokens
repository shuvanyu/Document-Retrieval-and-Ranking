purpose of review this review discusses recent evidence that suggests a significant underestimation of protein requirements in adult humansrecent findings traditionally total protein requirements for humans have been determined using nitrogen balancethe recent dietary reference intake recommendations for mean and populationsafe intakes of 066 and 08 gkgday respectively of highquality protein in adult humans are based on a metaanalysis of nitrogen balance studies using single linear regression analysiswe reanalyzed existing nitrogen balance studies using twophase linear regression analysis and obtained mean and safe protein requirements of 091 and 099 gkgday respectivelythe twophase linear regression analysis is considered more appropriate for biological analysis of doseresponse curvesconsidering the inherent problems associated with the nitrogen balance method we developed an alternative method the indicator amino acid oxidation technique to determine protein requirements the mean and populationsafe requirements in adult men were determined to be 093 and 12 gkgday and are 41 and 50 respectively higher than the current dietary reference intakes recommendationssummary the indicator amino acid oxidationbased requirement values of 093 and 12 g proteinkgday and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendationstherefore there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans
