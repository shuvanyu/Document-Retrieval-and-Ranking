antibiotics are used by veterinarians and producers to treat disease and improve animal productionthe federal government to ensure the safety of the food supply establishes antibiotic residue tolerances in edible animal tissues and determines the target tissues eg muscle for residue monitoringhowever when muscle is selected as the target tissue the federal government does not specify which type of muscle tissue is used for monitoring eg breast versus thighif specific muscle tissues incorporate residues at higher concentrations these tissues should be selected for residue monitoringto evaluate this possibility in poultry chickens were divided into four groups and at 33 days of age were dosed with enrofloxacin baytril as per label directions at either 25 ppm for 3 days 25 ppm for 7 days 50 ppm for 3 days or 50 ppm for 7 daysbreast and thigh muscle tissues were collected from each bird n  5 birds per day per group during the dosing and withdrawal period and fluoroquinolone concentrations were determinedthe results indicate higher overall enrofloxacin concentrations in breast versus thigh muscle for each treatment group p  005these data indicate at least for enrofloxacin that not all muscle tissues incorporate antibiotics at the same concentrationsthese results may be helpful to regulatory agencies as they determine what tissues are to be monitored to ensure that the established residue safety tolerance levels are not exceeded
