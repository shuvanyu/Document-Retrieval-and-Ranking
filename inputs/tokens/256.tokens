background the results of some epidemiologic studies conducted by using questionnaires suggest that dietary fat composition influences diabetes riskconfirmation of this finding with use of a biomarker is warrantedobjective we prospectively investigated the relation of plasma cholesterol ester ce and phospholipid pl fatty acid composition with the incidence of diabetes mellitusdesign in 2909 adults aged 4564 y plasma fatty acid composition was quantified by using gasliquid chromatography and was expressed as a percentage of total fatty acidsincident diabetes n  252 was identified during 9 y of followupresults after adjustment for age sex baseline body mass index waisttohip ratio alcohol intake cigarette smoking physical activity education and parental history of diabetes diabetes incidence was significantly and positively associated with the proportions of total saturated fatty acids in plasma ce and plthe rate ratios of incident diabetes across quintiles of saturated fatty acids were 100 136 116 160 and 208 p  00013 in ce and 100 175 187 240 and 337 p  00001 in plin ce the incidence of diabetes was also positively associated with the proportions of palmitic 160 palmitoleic 161n7 and dihomogammalinolenic 203n6 acids and inversely associated with the proportion of linoleic acid 182n6in pl incident diabetes was positively associated with the proportions of 160 and stearic acid 180conclusions the proportional saturated fatty acid composition of plasma is positively associated with the development of diabetesour findings with the use of this biomarker suggest indirectly that the dietary fat profile particularly that of saturated fat may contribute to the etiology of diabetes
