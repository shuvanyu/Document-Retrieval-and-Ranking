diet is purported to be means of exposure to many environmental contaminantsthe purpose of this study is to understand the influence of dietary change on the levels of exposure to several environmental chemicals  in particular antibiotics and phthalatesfor this purpose we examined the extent to which shortterm changes in diet influenced the inadvertent exposure levels to these chemicals in an adult populationwe recruited participants n25 of a fiveday temple stay program in korea and collected urine samples before and after the programwe also conducted a questionnaire survey on participants dietary patterns prior to their participationduring the program participants followed the daily routines of buddhist monks and maintained a vegetarian dieturinary levels of three antibiotics and their major metabolites metabolites of four major phthalates and malondialdehyde mda as an oxidative stress biomarker were analyzedthe frequency and levels of detection for antibiotics and phthalates noticeably decreased during the programurinary mda levels were significantly lower than before program participation 016 versus 027mgg creatininealthough the exposure to target compounds might be influenced by other behavioral patterns these results suggest that even shortterm changes in dietary behavior may significantly decrease inadvertent exposure to antibiotics and phthalates and hence may reduce oxidative stress levelscopyright 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
