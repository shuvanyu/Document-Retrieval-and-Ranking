perfluorooctanesulfonylfluoride posfbased compounds have been manufactured and used in a variety of industrial applicationsthese compounds degrade to perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos which is regarded as a persistent endstage metabolite and is found to accumulate in tissues of humans and wildlifepfos perfluorohexanesulfonate pfhxs perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonamide pfosa have been found in human sera from the united statesin this study concentrations of pfhxs perfluorobutanesulfonate pfbs pfos perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa pfoa perfluorononanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda perfluoroundecanoic acid pfunda perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoda and pfosa were measured in 85 samples of whole human blood collected from nine cities eight provinces in china including shenyang liaoning beijing hebei zhengzhou henan jintan jiangsu wuhan hubei zhoushan zhejiang guiyang guizhou xiamen fujian and fuzhou fujianamong the 10 perfluorinated compounds pfcs measured pfos was the predominant compoundthe mean concentration of pfos was greatest in samples collected from shenyang 792 ngml and least in samples from jintan 372 ngmlpfhxs was the next most abundant perfluorochemical in the samplesno agerelated differences in the concentrations of pfoa pfos pfosa and pfhxs were observedgenderrelated differences were foundwith males higher for pfos and pfhxs and females higher in pfundaconcentrations of pfhxs were positively correlated with those of pfos while concentrations of pfna pfda and pfunda were positively correlated with those of pfoathere were differences in the concentration profiles percentage composition of various pfcs in the samples among the nine cities
