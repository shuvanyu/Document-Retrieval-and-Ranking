fiftysix seasonal snowpack samples were collected at remote alpine subarctic and arctic sites in eight western us national parks during three consecutive years 20032005four currentuse pesticides cups dacthal dcpa chlorpyrifos endosulfan and γhexachlorocyclohexane hch and four historicuse pesticides hups dieldrin αhch chlordane and hexachlorobenzene hcb were commonly measured at all sites during all yearsthe mean coefficient of variation for pesticide concentrations was 15 for site replicate samples 41 for intrapark replicate samples and 59 for interannual replicate samplesthe relative pesticide concentration profiles were consistent from year to year but unique for individual parks indicating a regional source effecthup concentrations were wellcorrelated with regional cropland intensity when the effect of temperature on snowair partitioning was consideredthe mass of individual cups used in regions located oneday upwind of the parks was calculated using air mass back trajectories and this was used to explain the distribution of cups among the parksthe percent of the snowpack pesticide concentration due to regional transport was high 75 for the majority of pesticides in all parksthese results suggest that the majority of pesticide contamination in us national parks is due to pesticide use in north america
