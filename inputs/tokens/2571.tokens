a method has been developed to identify pesticide residues and foodstuffs for inclusion in national monitoring programs with different priority levelsit combines two chronic dietary intake indicators atmdi based on maximum residue levels and agricultural uses and edi on food contamination datathe mean and 95th percentile of exposure were calculated for 490 substances using individual and national consumption datathe results show that mean atmdi exceeds the acceptable daily intake adi for 10 of the pesticides and the mean upperbound edi is above the adi for 18 of substancesa sevenlevel risk scale is presented for substances already analyzed in food in france and substances not currently soughtof 336 substances analyzed 70 pesticides of concern levels 25 should be particularly monitored 22 of which are priority pesticides levels 4 and 5of 154 substances not sought 36 pesticides of concern levels 24 should be included in monitoring programs including 8 priority pesticides level 4in order to refine exposure assessment analytical improvements and developments are needed to lower the analytical limits for priority pesticidecommodity combinationsdeveloped nationally this method could be applied at different geographic scalescopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
