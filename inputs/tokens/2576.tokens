a previous study from our laboratory showed that pet cats had much higher serum levels of flame retardants compared to humans despite sharing the same household environmentdogs on the other hand are expected to have lower serum levels of flame retardants because they are metabolically better equipped to degrade these compoundsthus we hypothesized that dogs might be more similar to humans in their response to these environmental stressors and be better indicators of human exposures to these contaminantsserum samples and their food were collected from 18 dogs and analyzed for pbdes and other emerging flame retardantsthe concentrations of pbdes in dog serum and dog food averaged 18  04 ngg wet weight ww and 11  02 ngg ww respectivelywhile the dog serum samples were dominated by the tetra to hepta bde congeners bde209 was the most abundant congener in the dog foodthis difference in congener pattern was analyzed in terms of halflivesassuming food as the main exposure source the average halflife in dog serum was 450  170 days for the less brominated congeners and 23  05 days for bde209dust was also considered as an additional exposure source giving unreasonable residence timesin addition to pbdes other flame retardants including dechlorane plus decabromodiphenylethane and hexabromocyclododecane were identified in these samples
