we measured major pbdes and pcbs in breast adipose tissues of california women participating in a breast cancer study in the late 1990ssamples were analyzed using gas chromatography with electron impact ionization and tandem mass spectrometry detectionthe congener profile observed was bde47bde99bde153bde100bde154 and pcb153pcb180pcb138pcb118whereas high correlations were observed within each chemical class very weak correlations appeared between classes pointing to different exposure pathwaysweak negative associations were observed for pbde congeners and ageour pbde data are among the highest reported exceeding data from the national health and nutrition examination survey and consistent with the high use of pbdes in californiathese data may be helpful in establishing a baseline for pbde body burdens to gauge changes over time as a result of restrictions in the use of pbde formulationscopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
