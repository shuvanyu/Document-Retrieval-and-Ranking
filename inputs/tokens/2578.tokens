the adverse effect of bisphenola bpa on the male reproductive system observed in animal studies has not been well examined in human populationsbpa is potentially a serious public health problem because of its widely detected presence in the human bodythis study was conducted among 427 male workers in regions where high levels of bpa exposure existedall participants provided urine samples which were tested for bpa concentration using highperformance liquid chromatographymale sexual dysfunction was ascertained using standard male sexual function inventoriesmale sexual dysfunction was measured in 4 domains using 7 indicesafter controlling for potential confounders using linear regression increasing urine bpa level was associated with worsening male sexual function on a continuous scaleall 7 indices demonstrated this negative linear correlationincreasing urine bpa level was associated with decreased sexual desire p  001 more difficulty having an erection p  001 lower ejaculation strength p  001 and lower level of overall satisfaction with sex life p  01a similar negative correlation was also observed among participants exposed to bpa from only environmental sources no occupational exposure to bpa although the estimates in this group were less stable because of a smaller sample sizeour results reveal a correlation between a biological measure of urine bpa level and declining male sexual functionthis finding may enhance the understanding of the bpa effect in human populations and may have important public health implications given the widespread human exposure to bpa
