background and aim studies have shown monounsaturated oleic acid to be less toxic than palmitic acid and to preventattenuate palmitic acid hepatocites toxicity in steatosis models in vitrohowever to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis extent is unknownmethods we evaluated whether steatosis per se is associated with hepatocytes apoptosis and determined the role of oleic and palmitic acid the most abundant fatty acids in western diets on triglyceride accumulation and apoptosis in an in vitro model of steatosis induced in three hepatocytic cell lines hepg2 huh7 wrl68the impact of incubation for 24 h with oleic 066 and 132 mm and palmitic acid 033 and 066 mm alone or combined molar ratio 2  1 on steatosis apoptosis and insulin signalling was evaluatedresults concurrent with ppargamma and srebp1 gene activation steatosis extent was larger when cells were treated with oleic than with palmitic acid the latter fatty acid was associated with increased pparalpha expressioncell apoptosis was inversely proportional to steatosis depositionmoreover palmitic but not oleic acid impaired insulin signallingdespite the higher amount of fat resulting from incubation of the two fatty acids combined the apoptosis rate and impaired insulin signalling were lower than in cells treated with palmitic acid alone indicating a protective effect of oleic acidconclusions oleic acid is more steatogenic but less apoptotic than palmitic acid in hepatocityc cell culturesthese data may provide a biological basis for clinical findings on dietary patterns and pathogenetic models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
