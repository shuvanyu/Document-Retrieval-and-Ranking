background xenobiotic organochlorine pesticides ocps are a major environmental problem because of their historic widespread use pronounced persistence against chemical and biological degradation and bioaccumulation in the food chainpesticide use is prevalent in the production of edible bamboo shoots which are exported widely from chinato evaluate the quality of chinese bamboo shoots we determined the residual content of some ocps in shoot samplesresults three types of ocpshexachlorocyclohexane hch 111trichlor22bispchlorophenylethane ddt and pentachloronitrobenzene pcnbwere detected in bamboo shoots from zhejiang province chinadetection rates were 100 100 and 75 for hch ddt and pcnb respectivelyhowever the average residue concentration did not exceed the maximum residue limit for pesticides detected in food in china 50 Âµg kg1 in terms of residue concentrations of the pesticides 8214 of the bamboo shoot samples could be classified as safeconclusion while all sampled bamboo shoots contained ocp most 8214 were safe for consumption2010 society of chemical industry
