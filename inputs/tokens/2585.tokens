chlorophyll chla and chlorophyllin chl were shown previously to reduce carcinogen bioavailability biomarker damage and tumorigenicity in trout and ratsthese findings were partially extended to humans where chl reduced excretion of aflatoxin b1 afb1dna repair products in chinese unavoidably exposed to dietary afb1however neither afb1 pharmacokinetics nor chla effects were examinedwe conducted an unblinded crossover study to establish afb1 pharmacokinetic parameters among four human volunteers and to explore possible effects of chl or chla cotreatment in three of those volunteersfor protocol 1 fasted subjects received an institutional review boardapproved dose of 14cafb1 30 ng 5 nci by capsule with 100 ml water followed by normal eating and drinking after 2 hoursblood and cumulative urine samples were collected over 72 hours and 14c afb1 equivalents were determined by accelerator mass spectrometryprotocols 2 and 3 were similar except capsules also contained 150 mg of purified chla or chl respectivelyprotocols were repeated thrice for each volunteerthe study revealed rapid human afb1 uptake plasma ka 505  or  110 h1 tmax 10 hour and urinary elimination 95 complete by 24 hours kineticschla and chl treatment each significantly impeded afb1 absorption and reduced cmax and aucs plasma and urine in one or more subjectsthese initial results provide afb1 pharmacokinetic parameters previously unavailable for humans and suggest that chla or chl coconsumption may limit the bioavailability of ingested aflatoxin in humans as they do in animal models
