human diet may contain many mutagenic or carcinogenic aromatic compounds as well as some beneficial physiologically active dietary components especially plant food phytochemicals which act as mutagenesis or carcinogenesis inhibitorsthis study compared the binding properties of natural compounds in the human diet caffeine theophylline theobromine and resveratrol with a watersoluble derivative of chlorophyll to bind to acridine orange a known mutagenan analysis was conducted to determine which substances were effective binding agents and may thus be useful in prevention of chemicalinduced mutagenesis and carcinogenesisdata indicated that in order to bind 50 of the mutagen in a complex less than twice the concentration of chlorophyllin was needed the resveratrol concentration was 20fold higher while a 1000fold or even 10000fold excess of xanthines were required to bind acridine orange
