a lowgrade inflammatory response metaflammation has been found to be associated with certain chronic diseasesproposed inducers of this have been aspects of the modern lifestyle including newly introduced foodsplasma tag and the inflammatory cytokines creactive protein crp tnfalpha and il6 were compared in a randomised crossover trial using ten healthy subjects before and after eating 100 g of kangaroo or a new form of hybridised beef wagyu separated by about 1 weekpostprandial levels for 1 and 2 h of tag il6 and tnfalpha were significantly higher after eating wagyu compared with kangaroo p  0002 for tag at 1 h p  0001 at 2 h p  0001 for il6 and tnfalpha at 1 and 2 hcrp was significantly higher 1 h postprandially after wagyu p  0011 and nonsignificantly higher 2 h postprandially p  0090we conclude that the metaflammatory reaction to ingestion of a new form of hybridised beef wagyu is indicative of a lowgrade systemic immune reaction when compared with lean game meat kangaroofurther studies using isoenergetic intake and isolating fatty acid components of meats are proposed
