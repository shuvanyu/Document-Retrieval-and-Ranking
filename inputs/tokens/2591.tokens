a form of lowgrade systemic inflammation metaflammation is linked to many types of chronic diseaseinitially this was thought to be causally related to weight gain and obesity and a possible explanation of the link between obesity and diseasehowever several lifestylerelated inducers of such inflammation some of which are associated with obesity but some of which are not have now been identifiedthe most common of these have been nutritive related suggesting that there could still be a relationship either directly or indirectly with obesityhere we provide evidence for nonnutritive inflammatory inducers providing further support for an earlier suggestion that while obesity beyond a point may have a direct link with disease this may be neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the current epidemic of chronic diseasea more ubiquitous cause encompassing all inflammatory inducers is the modern postindustrial environment and lifestyles emanating from thisobesity may thus be more of a canary in the mineshaft warning of bigger global problems than just a single pathway to modern environmentally driven disease 2010 the authorsobesity reviews  2010 international association for the study of obesity
