oxygen is vital for most organisms but paradoxically damages key biological sitesoxygenic threat is met by antioxidants that evolved in parallel with our oxygenic atmosphereplants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against reactive oxygen species ros oxidants produced during photosynthesisthe human body is exposed to these same oxidants and we have also evolved an effective antioxidant systemhowever this is not infallibleros breach defences oxidative damage ensues accumulates with age and causes a variety of pathological changesplantbased antioxidantrich foods traditionally formed the major part of the human diet and plantbased dietary antioxidants are hypothesized to have an important role in maintaining human healththis hypothesis is logical in evolutionary terms especially when we consider the relatively hypoxic environment in which humans may have evolvedin this paper the human diet is discussed briefly in terms of its evolutionary development different strategies of antioxidant defence are outlined and evolution of dietary antioxidants is discussed from the perspectives of plant need and our current dietary requirementsfinally possibilities in regard to dietary antioxidants evolution and human health are presented and an evolutionary costbenefit analysis is presented in relation to why we lost the ability to make ascorbic acid vitamin c although we retained an absolute requirement for it
