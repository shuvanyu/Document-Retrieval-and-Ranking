high levels of insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer whereas increased levels of some of its binding proteins igfbps seem to be protectivehigh intakes of dietary protein especially animal and soy protein appear to increase igf1however soy isoflavones have demonstrated antiproliferative and apoptotic effects both in vitro and in vivowe evaluated dietary intakes of total protein and soy isoflavones in relation to the igf axis in prostate cancer patients making comprehensive lifestyle changes including a very lowfat vegan diet supplemented with soy protein 58 gdayafter one year intervention group patients reported significantly higher intakes of dietary protein and soy isoflavones compared to usualcare controls p  0001igf1 increased significantly in both groups whereas igfbp1 rose in the experimental group only p  001increases in vegetable protein over one year were associated with increases in igfbp1 among intervention group patients p  005these results suggest that dietary protein and soy isoflavones in the context of comprehensive lifestyle changes may not significantly alter igf1however given the recent literature indicating that high intake of protein rich in essential amino acids animal or soy protein may increase igf1 it may be prudent for men with early stage prostate cancer not to exceed dietary protein recommendations
