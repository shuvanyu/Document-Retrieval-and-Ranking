life span extending mutations in growth signaling pathways protect against agedependent dna damage in yeast and decrease insulin resistance and cancer in miceto test their effect in humans we monitored for 22 years ecuadorian subjects with mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene leading to severe growth hormone receptor ghr and igfi deficiencies and combined this information with surveys to identify the cause and age of death for subjects who died before this periodthe individuals with ghr deficiency ghrd exhibited only one nonlethal malignancy and no cases of diabetes in contrast to 17 cancer and 5 diabetes prevalence in the controlsa possible explanation for the very low incidence of cancer may be revealed by in vitro studies serum from ghrd subjects reduced dna breaks but increased apoptosis in human mammary epithelial cells hmecs treated with hydrogen peroxidewe also observed reduced insulin concentrations 14 μuml vs 44μuml in unaffected relatives and a very low homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance homair index 034 vs 096 in unaffected relatives in ghrd individuals indicating increased insulin sensitivity which could explain the absence of diabetes in these subjectsincubation of hmecs with ghrd serum also resulted in reduced expression of ras pka and tor and upregulation of sod2 changes that promote cellular protection and life span extension in model organismsthese results provide evidence for a role of evolutionarily conserved pathways in promoting aging and diseases in humans and identify a candidate drug target for healthy life span extension
