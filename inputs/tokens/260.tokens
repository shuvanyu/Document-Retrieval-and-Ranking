aimshypothesis prolonged elevation of plasma specific fatty acids may exert differential effects on glucosestimulated insulin secretion gsis insulin sensitivity and clearancesubjects and methods we examined the effect of oral ingestion at regular intervals for 24 h of an emulsion containing either predominantly monounsaturated mufa polyunsaturated pufa or saturated sfa fat or water control on gsis insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance in seven overweight or obese nondiabetic humansfour studies were conducted in each individual in random order 46 weeks aparttwentyfour hours after initiation of oral ingestion subjects underwent a 2 h 20 mmoll hyperglycaemic clamp to assess gsis insulin sensitivity and insulin clearanceresults following oral ingestion of any of the three fat emulsions over 24 h plasma nefas were elevated by approximately 15 to 2fold over the basal levelingestion of any of the three fat emulsions resulted in reduction in insulin clearance and sfa ingestion reduced insulin sensitivitypufa ingestion was associated with an absolute reduction in gsis whereas insulin secretion failed to compensate for insulin resistance in subjects who ingested sfaconclusionsinterpretation oral ingestion of fats with differing degrees of saturation resulted in different effects on insulin secretion and actionpufa ingestion resulted in an absolute reduction in insulin secretion and sfa ingestion induced insulin resistancefailure of insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance implies impaired beta cell function in the sfa study
