summary background insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 stimulates mitosis and inhibits apoptosissome published results have shown an association between circulating igf1 and breastcancer risk but it has been unclear whether this relationship is consistent or whether it is modified by igf binding protein 3 igfbp3 menopausal status oestrogen receptor status or other factorsthe relationship of igf1 and igfbp3 with breastcancer risk factors is also unclearthe endogenous hormones and breast cancer collaborative group was established to analyse pooled individual data from prospective studies to increase the precision of the estimated associations of endogenous hormones with breastcancer riskmethods individual data on prediagnostic igf1 and igfbp3 concentrations were obtained from 17 prospective studies in 12 countriesthe associations of igf1 with risk factors for breast cancer in controls were examined by calculating geometric mean concentrations in categories of these factorsthe odds ratios ors with 95 cis of breast cancer associated with increasing igf1 concentrations were estimated by conditional logistic regression in 4790 cases and 9428 matched controls with stratification by study age at baseline and date of baselineall statistical tests were twosided and a p value of less than 005 was considered significantfindings igf1 concentrations adjusted for age were positively associated with height and age at first pregnancy inversely associated with age at menarche and years since menopause and were higher in moderately overweight women and moderate alcohol consumers than in other womenthe or for breast cancer for women in the highest versus the lowest fifth of igf1 concentration was 128 95 ci 114144 p00001this association was not altered by adjusting for igfbp3 and did not vary significantly by menopausal status at blood collectionthe ors for a difference in igf1 concentration between the highest and lowest fifth were 138 95 ci 114168 for oestrogenreceptorpositive tumours and 080 057113 for oestrogenreceptornegative tumours p for heterogeneity0007interpretation circulating igf1 is positively associated with breastcancer riskthe association is not substantially modified by igfbp3 and does not differ markedly by menopausal status but seems to be confined to oestrogenreceptorpositive tumoursfunding cancer research uk
