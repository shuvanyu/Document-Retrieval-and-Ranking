metastatic rather than primary tumours are responsible for ninety percent cancer deathsdespite significant advances in the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms in tumour metastases there are limitations in preventive treatment of metastatic tumoursmuch evidence arising from laboratory and clinical studies suggests that growth factors and their receptors are implicated in cancer metastases developmentwe review the origin and production of growth factors and their receptors in all stages of cancer metastases including epithelialmesenchymal transition cancer cell invasion and migration survival within the circulation seeding at distant organs and metastatic tumour angiogenesisthe functions of growth factors and their receptors are also discussedthis review presents the efforts made in understanding this challenge to aid in the development of new treatment strategies for cancer metastases
