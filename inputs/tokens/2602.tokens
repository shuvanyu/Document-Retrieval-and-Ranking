background centenarians are exceptionally long living individuals who escaped the most common agerelated diseasesin particular they appear to be effectively protected from cancersthe mechanisms that underlie this protection are quite complex and still largely unclearaim to critically analyse the literature in order to propose a unifying hypothesis that can account for this cancer protection in centenariansmethods review of the scientific literature regarding three main players in tumourigenesis such as igf1 inflammation and p53 and centenariansresults centenarians appear to be characterised by low igf1mediated responses and high levels of antiinflammatory cytokines such as il10 and tgfbeta a condition that results in protection from cancerboth inflammation and igf1 pathway converge on the tumour suppressor p53accordingly some studies indicate that genetic variants of p53 are associated with human longevity by providing protection from cancer mortalityconclusions the available data let us to hypothesise that among other possible mechanisms wellpreserved p53mediated responses are likely a key factor contributing to protection from cancer in centenarians
