epidemiologic and biological data strongly support the existence of a strict link between cancer and agingin spite of the relevance of the problem there were numerous pitfalls in epidemiologic investigation until a few years agoan apparent decrease of cancer incidence in old age was revealed to be a misconception based on lack of sufficient appreciation for changing population sizebut not all problems are solved by using agespecific cancer incidence as recently stressed by some authorsat very advanced ages a slowing of the rate of increase of agespecific cancer incidence is clearly demonstratedthese findings apparently clash with the majority of biological data and suggest that some mechanism may develop at advanced ages capable of decreasing cancer susceptibilityin this paper it will be shown that just a slowingdown kinetics is predicted for cancer incidence by using a mathematical model of mortality kinetics recently proposed in the gerontologic fieldthe slowing of the increasing rate or even a decreasing trend of cancer incidence of an aging population is compatible with a continuously accelerating pace of loss of physiological capacity of the single subjects as with advancing age there is a selection of individuals with better physiological functions
