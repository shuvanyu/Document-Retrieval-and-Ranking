background elevated serum saturated fatty acid levels and hepatocyte lipoapoptosis are features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldaim the purpose of this study was to investigate saturated fatty acid induction of lipoapoptosis in human liver cells and the underlying mechanismsmethods human liver l02 and hepg2 cells were treated with sodium palmitate a saturated fatty acid for up to 48 h with or without lithium chloride a glycogen synthase kinase3β gsk3β inhibitor or gsk3β shrna transfectiontransmission electron microscopy was used to detect morphological changes flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis a colorimetric assay was used to detect caspase3 activity and western blot analysis was used to detect protein expressionresults the data showed that sodium palmitate was able to induce lipoapoptosis in l02 and hepg2 cellswestern blot analysis showed that sodium palmitate activated gsk3β protein which was indicated by dephosphorylation of gsk3β at ser9however inhibition of gsk3β activity with lithium chloride treatment or knockdown of gsk3β expression with shrna suppressed sodium palmitateinduced lipoapoptosis in l02 and hepg2 cellson a molecular level inhibition of gsk3β expression or activity suppressed sodium palmitateinduced cjunnterminal kinase jnk phosphorylation and bax upregulation whereas gsk3β inhibition did not affect endoplasmic reticulum stressinduced activation of unfolded protein responseconclusions the present data demonstrated that saturated fatty acid sodium palmitateinduced lipoapoptosis in human liver l02 and hepg2 cells was regulated by gsk3β activation which led to jnk activation and bax upregulationthis finding indicates that gsk3β inhibition may be a potential therapeutic target to control nafld
