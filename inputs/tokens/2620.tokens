the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a preload including dried prunes consumed as a snack before a meal compared to an isoenergetic and equal weighed bread product preload would a have greater shortterm effect on satiety measured by subsequent ad libitum meal intake b induce greater satiety as assessed by visual analogue scales vas and c reduce appetite for dessert offered shortly after lunchfortyfive healthy normalweight subjects participated in this randomised withinsubject crossover studystatistical analysis of the results showed that when subjects consumed the preload that included dried prunes also consumed less amount of dessert and had lower total energy intake at mealadditionally subjects feeling of hunger desire and motivation to eat as assessed with the use of vas were lower at all time points between snack and mealsince macronutrients content of both preloads were similar the satiating power of prunes could be due to their relatively high fiber contentidentifying meal patterns and foods that promote satiety without increasing considerably the overall energy intake is very importantthe addition of dried prunes to a snack seems to promote satiety besides providing valuable nutrients2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
