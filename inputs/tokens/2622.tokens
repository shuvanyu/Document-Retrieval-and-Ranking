we investigated the glycemic index gi and the insulinemic index ii of cake made from whole soy powder sbc and the suppressive effects of sbc on the postprandial blood glucose and insulin by other carbohydrate foodsfurthermore breath hydrogen excretion was simultaneously investigatedtwenty subjects were given 114 g sbc 144 g cooked paddyrice and 60 g sbc with 144 g cooked paddyrice in random order using a withinsubject repeatedmeasures designblood and endexpiratory gas were collected at the indicated periods after ingestionthe gi and the ii of sbc were 226 and 4829 respectivelythe elevation of blood glucose by cooked paddyrice was significantly suppressed by the addition of 60 g sbc although the insulin secretion did not decreasebreath hydrogen excretion by the addition of sbc to 144 g cooked paddyrice was not significantly increased in comparison with cooked paddyrice alonesbc was of low gi and low ii but the postprandial insulin secretion in response to cooked paddyrice was not suppressed
