we conducted a systematic review investigating body fat distribution in older adults and its association with morbidity and mortalityour search yielded 2702 citationsfollowing three levels of screening 25 studies were selected to evaluate the association between body fat distribution and comorbidity and 17 studies were used in the mortality analysismost of the selected studies in our analyses used anthropometric measures eg body mass index bmi waist circumference and waisthip ratio relatively few studies used direct measures such as body fatlean mass and percentage body fatstudies reported inconsistent findings regarding the strongest predictors of morbidity and mortalityhowever the majority of studies suggested that bmi per se was not the most appropriate predictor of morbidity and mortality in the elderly because of its inability to discern or detect agerelated body fat redistributionin addition studies using bmi found that the optimal bmi range for the lowest mortality in the elderly was overweight 25 kgm2  bmi  30 kgm2 or mildly obese 30 kgm2  bmi  35 kgm2our findings suggest that the current clinical guidelines recommending that overweight and obesity are major risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality are not applicable to this populationtherefore the central message of this review is to admonish the government to establish new guidelines specifically for this population using a combination of body fat distribution measurements and to certify that these guidelines will not be applied to inappropriate populations
