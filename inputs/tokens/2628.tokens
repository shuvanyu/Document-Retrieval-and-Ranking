satiety which is the inhibition of eating following the end of a meal is influenced by a number of food characteristics including compositional and structural factorsan increased understanding of these factors and the mechanisms whereby they exert their effects on satiety may offer a foodbased approach to weight managementwater and gas which are often neglected in nutrition are major components of many foods and contribute to volume and to sensory and other characteristicsa review of previous shortterm studies that evaluated the effects of water or gas in foods on satiety showed that while satiety was generally increased effects on subsequent intakes were not always apparentthese studies were diverse in terms of design timings and food matrices which precludes definitive conclusionshowever the results indicate that solids may be more effective at increasing satiety than liquids but gas may be as effective as wateralthough increased gastric distension may be the main mechanism underlying these effects preingestive and ingestive impacts on cognitive anticipatory and sensory responses also appear to be involvedfurthermore there is limited evidence that water on its own may be effective at increasing satiety and decreasing intakes when drunk before but not with a meallongerterm extrapolation suggests that increasing food volumes with water or gas may offer weightmanagement strategieshowever from a practical viewpoint the effects of water and gas on satiety may be best exploited by using these nonnutrients to manipulate perceived portion sizes without increasing energy contents
