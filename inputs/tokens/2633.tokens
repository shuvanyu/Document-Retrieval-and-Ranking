purpose of review highfiber diets have been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of inflammation markersincreased production of fermentationderived shortchain fatty acids scfas is one of the factors that could exert these positive effectsthis review examines the effects of scfas on immune cells and discusses the relevance of their effects on systemic inflammation as frequently seen in obesityrecent findings scfas have been shown to reduce chemotaxis and cell adhesion this effect is dependent on type and concentration of scfain spite of conflicting results especially butyrate seems to have an antiinflammatory effect mediated by signaling pathways like nuclear factorÎºb and inhibition of histone deacetylasethe discrepancies in the results could be explained by differences in cell types used and their proliferative and differentiation statussummary scfas show antiinflammatory effects and seem to have the potency to prevent infiltration of immune cells from the bloodstream in for example the adipose tissuein addition their ability to inhibit the proliferation and activation of t cells and to prevent adhesion of antigenpresenting cells could be important as it recently has been shown that obesityassociated inflammation might be antigendependentmore studies with concentrations in micromolar range are needed to approach more physiological concentrations
