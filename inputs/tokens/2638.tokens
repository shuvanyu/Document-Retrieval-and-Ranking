peanuts and peanut butter are commonly consumed as a snack meal component and ingredient in various commercial productstheir consumption is associated with reduced cvd risk and they pose little threat to positive energy balancehowever questions have arisen as to whether product form egwhole nut v butter and processing properties egroasting and adding flavours may compromise their positive health effectsthe present study investigated the effects of peanut form and processing on two cvd risk factors fasting plasma lipids and body weightone hundred and eighteen adults fortyseven males and seventyone females age 292 sd 84 years bmi 300 sd 45 kgm2 from brazil ghana and the united states were randomised to consume 56 g of raw unsalted n 23 roasted unsalted n 24 roasted salted n 23 or honey roasted n 24 peanuts or peanut butter n 24 daily for 4 weekspeanut form and processing did not differentially affect body weight or fasting plasma lipid responses in the total samplehowever hdlcholesterol increased significantly at the group level and total cholesterol ldlcholesterol and tag concentrations decreased significantly in individuals classified as having elevated fasting plasma lipids compared with those with normal fasting plasma lipidsthese observations suggest that the processing attributes assessed in this trial do not compromise the lipidlowering effects of peanuts and do not negatively impact body weightfurther studies are warranted to determine the effects of form and processing on other health risk factors
