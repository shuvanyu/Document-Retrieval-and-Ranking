phytosterols were quantified in nuts and seeds commonly consumed in the united statestotal lipid extracts were subjected to acid hydrolysis and then alkaline saponfication and free sterols were analyzed as trimethylsilyl derivatives by capillary gcfid and gcms delta5avenasterol was quantified after alkaline saponification plus direct analysis of the glucosidesesame seed and wheat germ had the highest total phytosterol content 400413 mg100 g and brazil nuts the lowest 95 mg100 gof the products typically consumed as snack foods pistachio and sunflower kernel were richest in phytosterols 270289 mg100 gbetasitosterol delta5avenasterol and campesterol were predominantcampestanol ranged from 10 to 127 mg100 g only 13 mg100 g betasitosterol was found in pumpkin seed kernel although total sterol content was high 265 mg100 gphytosterol concentrations were greater than reported in existing food composition databases probably due to the inclusion of steryl glycosides which represent a significant portion of total sterols in nuts and seeds
