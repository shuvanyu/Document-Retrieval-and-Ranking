backgroundobjectives extrinsic phytosterols supplemented to the diet reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption and plasma ldlcholesterolhowever little is known about their effects on cholesterol metabolism when given in native unpurified form and in amounts achievable in the dietthe objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that intrinsic phytosterols present in unmodified foods alter wholebody cholesterol metabolismsubjectsmethods twenty out of 24 subjects completed a randomized crossover feeding trial where all meals were provided by a metabolic kitcheneach subject consumed two diets for 4 weeks eachthe diets differed in phytosterol content phytosterolpoor diet 126 mg phytosterols2000 kcal phytosterolabundant diet 449 mg2000 kcal but were otherwise matched for nutrient contentcholesterol absorption and excretion were determined by gas chromatographmass spectrometry after oral administration of stable isotopic tracersresults the phytosterolabundant diet resulted in lower cholesterol absorption 542  22  95 confidence interval 505 579 vs 732  13 695 769 p00001 and 79 higher fecal cholesterol excretion 1322  112 10832 14833 vs 739  97 mgday 5301 9302 p00001 relative to the phytosterolpoor dietplasma lathosterolcholesterol ratio rose 82 from 071  011 041 096 to 129  014 Î¼gmg 098 153 p00001ldlcholesterol was similar between dietsconclusions intrinsic phytosterols at levels present in a healthy diet are biologically active and have large effects on whole body cholesterol metabolism not reflected in circulating ldlmore work is needed to assess the effects of phytosterolmediated fecal cholesterol excretion on coronary heart disease risk in humans
