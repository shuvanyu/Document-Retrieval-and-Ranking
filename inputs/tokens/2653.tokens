four out of eight healthier oilsnamely almond oil avocado oil hazelnut oil and macadamia nut oilstudied were rich sources of monounsaturated fatty acids like olive oilgrape seed oil rice barn oil marketed recently toasted sesame oil and walnut oil contained high levels of essential fatty acidsthe order of oxidative stability determined by rancimat measuring of the induction period at four temperatures 90 degrees c 100 degrees c 110 degrees c and 120 degrees c was found to be macadamia oil  rice bran oil approximately toasted sesame oil  avocado oil  almond oil  hazelnut oil  grape seed oil  walnut oilhighlevel monounsaturated fatty acid oils gave a linear relationship between 100 times the reciprocal of the induction period against the total unsaturated fatty acid content obtained as c182  008 x c181  208 x c183 while the polyunsaturated fatty acid oils gave an exponential relationshipin the case of rice bran and hazelnut oils shelflife prediction from the extrapolation of the arrhenius plots and the q10 factors was compared well with that of storage time given by the oil producersin the cases of the other oils with an exception of macadamia nut oil the predicted shelflives were significantly lower than that of the storage times especially walnut oil very prone to oxidation gave 1520 times lower shelflife than the bestbefore storage life
