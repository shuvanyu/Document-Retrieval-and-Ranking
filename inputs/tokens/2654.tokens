influence of diet composition on mood during weightreducing diets was studied in healthy young women of normal weighta broad range of macronutrient intake was achieved by means of divergent dietary instructions for the composition of a 1000 kcal per day diet adhered to for six weeksglobal mood during the last three weeks of the diet was significantly better in the vegetarian than in the mixed diet groupduring this time a significant correlation was observed between relative carbohydrate intake and global mood r  074 p less than 001 and between the ratio of plasma tryptophan to other large neutral amino acids a predictor of tryptophan flow into brain and global mood r  052 p less than 005results suggest that group differences are related to differences in carbohydrate intakeit is hypothesized that impairment of central serotonergic function due to reduced tryptophan availability can prompt mood deterioration in situations of relatively low carbohydrate intake
