biogenic monoamines such as serotonin tryptamine and tyramine function as neurotransmitters and mitogenic factors in animals and are involved in flowering morphogenesis and protection from and adaptation to environmental changes in plantsin plants serotonin and tyramine are conjugated to form phenolic compounds via thioester linkages during the synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acid amides including pcoumaroylserotonin cs feruloylserotonin fs pcoumaroyltyramine ct and feruloyltyramine ftin this study we determined the amounts of the biogenic monoamines cs fs ct and ft in commonly consumed vegetables using highperformance liquid chromatographyserotonin tryptamine and tyramine were detected in all vegetables testedthe serotonin levels ranged from 18 to 294 microgg of dry weight the tryptamine levels ranged from 08 to 372 microgg of dry weight and the tyramine levels ranged from 14 to 286 microgg of dry weightthe highest serotonin and tryptamine contents were found in tomato and cherry tomato 1403222 microgg of dry weight while paprika and green pepper had higher tyramine contents than the other vegetables 286 and 1415 microgg of dry weight respectivelyoverall the levels of cs fs ct and ft ranged from 003 to 138 microgg of dry weight with green onion possessing the highest levels of cs 069 microgg of dry weight ft 199 microgg of dry weight and ct 1385 microgg of dry weight
