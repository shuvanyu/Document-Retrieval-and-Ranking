iron is an essential trace metal in human metabolismhowever imbalances in iron homeostasis are prevalent worldwide and have detrimental effects on human healthhumans do not have the ability to remove excess iron and therefore iron homeostasis is maintained by regulating the amount of iron entering the body from the dietiron is present in the human diet in number of different forms including heme from meat and a variety of nonheme iron compoundswhile heme is absorbed intact the bioavailability of nonheme iron varies greatly depending on dietary compositiona number of dietary components are capable of interacting with iron to regulate its solubility and oxidation stateinterestingly there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that some nutrients also have direct effects on the expression and function of enterocyte iron transportersin addition to dietary factors body iron status is a major determinant of iron absorptionthe roles of these important dietary and systemic factors in regulating iron absorption will be discussed in this review
