the marked agerelated decline in serum dehydroepiandrosterone dhea and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas has suggested that a deficiency of these steroids may be causally related to the development of a series of diseases that are generally associated with agingpostulated consequences of low dhea levels include insulin resistance obesity cardiovascular disease cancer reduction of the immune defence system as well as psychosocial problems such as depression and a general deterioration in the sensation of wellbeing and cognitive functionclinically the spectrum of women that would benefit from dhea therapy is not clearly defined and nor is the dosage of hormone treatmentwhether dhea therapy could be prescribed as a general antiaging therapy or could be an alternative treatment for women suffering from androgen deficiency syndrome remains uncertain across studiesthe lack of definitive evidence for biological mechanisms and the presence of only a few studies that address these emerging issues of dhea therapy in postmenopausal women might encourage a new critical analysis of the available literature evidencing current limits and incongruities
