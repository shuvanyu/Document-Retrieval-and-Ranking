dehydroepiandrosterone dhea is the major steroid produced by the adrenal zona reticularis and in contrast to cortisol and aldosterone its secretion declines with ageingthis has generated major interest in its putative role as an antiageing hormonehowever it is not clear that the ageassociated physiological decline in dhea secretion represents a harmful deficiencydhea exhibits its action mainly by conversion to sex steroidsin addition dhea has neurosteroidal properties and may exhibit direct action via specific binding sites on endothelial cellsthere is convincing evidence for beneficial effects of dhea in patients with adrenal insufficiency and future research will hopefully elucidate its role in patients receiving pharmacological glucocorticoid treatmenthowever in healthy elderly subjects current evidence from randomised controlled trials does not justify the use of dhea with no major beneficial effects reported and in addition potentially adverse effects on sex steroiddependent tumour growth need to be consideredcopyright 2004 elsevier ltd
