background increasingly the potential harm from high cholesterol intake and specifically from egg yolks is considered insignificantwe therefore assessed total plaque area tpa in patients attending canadian vascular prevention clinics to determine if the atherosclerosis burden as a marker of arterial damage was related to egg intaketo provide perspective on the magnitude of the effect we also analysed the effect of smoking packyearsmethods consecutive patients attending vascular prevention clinics at university hospital had baseline measurement of tpa by duplex ultrasound and filled out questionnaires regarding their lifestyle and medications including packyears of smoking and the number of egg yolks consumed per week times the number of years consumed eggyolk yearsresults data were available in 1262 patients mean sd age was 615 148 years 47 were womencarotid plaque area increased linearly with age after age 40 but increased exponentially with packyears of smoking and with eggyolk yearsplaque area in patients consuming 2 eggs per week n  388 was 125  129 mm2 versus 132  142 mm2 in those consuming 3 or more eggs per week n  603 p  00001 after adjustment for agein multiple regression eggyolk years remained significant after adjusting for coronary risk factorsinterpretation our findings suggest that regular consumption of egg yolk should be avoided by persons at risk of cardiovascular diseasethis hypothesis should be tested in a prospective study with more detailed information about diet and other possible confounders such as exercise and waist circumferencecopyright  2012 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
