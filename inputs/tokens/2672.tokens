hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism frequently observed in patients with endstage renal disease are associated with renal osteodystrophy organ calcification cardiovascular disease and sudden deathrestriction of dietary protein and phosphorus is beneficial in slowing the progression of renal failuredietary phosphorus restriction must be prescribed at all stages of renal failure in adultsit may be achieved by decreasing protein intake and avoiding foods rich in phosphorusan average of 6080 of the phosphorus intake is absorbed in the gut in dialysis patientsif phosphate binders are employed the phosphorus absorbed from the diet may be reduced to 40conventional hemodialysis with a highflux highefficiency dialyzer removes approximately 30 mmol 900 mg phosphorus during each dialysis performed three times weeklytherefore 750 mg of phosphorus intake should be the critical value above which a positive balance of phosphorus may occurthis value corresponds to a protein diet of 4550 gday or 08 gkg body weightday for a 60 kg patienttarget levels should become 9296 mgdl for calcium 2555 mgdl for phosphorus 55 mg2dl2 for the calciumphosphorus product and 100200 pgml for intact parathyroid hormone
