objective to evaluate the changes in circulating endotoxin after a highsaturated fat meal to determine whether these effects depend on metabolic disease stateresearch design and methods subjects n  54 were given a highfat meal 75 g fat 5 g carbohydrate 6 g protein after an overnight fast nonobese control noc age 399  118 years mean  sd bmi 249  32 kgm2 n  9 obese age 438  95 years bmi 333  25 kgm2 n  15 impaired glucose tolerance igt age 417  113 years bmi 320  45 kgm2 n  12 type 2 diabetic age 454  101 years bmi 303  45 kgm2 n  18blood was collected before 0 h and after the meal 14 h for analysisresults baseline endotoxin was significantly higher in the type 2 diabetic and igt subjects than in noc subjects with baseline circulating endotoxin levels 606 higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than in noc subjects p  005ingestion of a highfat meal led to a significant rise in endotoxin levels in type 2 diabetic igt and obese subjects over the 4h time period p  005these findings also showed that at 4 h after a meal type 2 diabetic subjects had higher circulating endotoxin levels 1254 than noc subjects p  005conclusions these studies have highlighted that exposure to a highfat meal elevates circulating endotoxin irrespective of metabolic state as early as 1 h after a mealhowever this increase is substantial in igt and type 2 diabetic subjects suggesting that metabolic endotoxinemia is exacerbated after high fat intakein conclusion our data suggest that in a compromised metabolic state such as type 2 diabetes a continual snacking routine will cumulatively promote their condition more rapidly than in other individuals because of the greater exposure to endotoxin
