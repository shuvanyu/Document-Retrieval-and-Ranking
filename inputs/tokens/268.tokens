the effects exerted by three mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs were evaluated on human fetal corpora cavernosa cells as a model for male external genitalia developmentthe three mixtures feature congeners grouped according to potentially shared modes of action one dioxinlike dl mix2 and two non dioxinlike ndl mixtures featuring congeners defined as estrogenic mix1 and highly persistentcytochrome p450 inducers mix3congeners concentrations used were derived from human internal exposure datatoxicogenomic analysis revealed that all mixtures modulated critical genes involved in genitourinary development however displaying three different expression profilesthe dl mix2 modulated actinrelated cellcell and epithelialmesenchymal communication morphogenetic processes mix1 modulated smooth muscle function genes whereas mix3 mainly modulated genes involved in cell metabolism eg steroid and lipid synthesis and growthour data indicate that fetal exposure to environmentally relevant pcb levels modulates several patterns of genitourinary programming moreover ndl congener groups may have specific modes of actioncopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
