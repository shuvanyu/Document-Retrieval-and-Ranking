the ingestion of fatty meals is associated with a transient lowgrade systemic inflammatory response in human subjects involving the activation of circulating monocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokineshowever it is not yet clear how different foodstuffs may promote inflammatory signallingin a screen of forty filtersterilised soluble extracts from common foodstuffs seven were found to induce the secretion of tnfα and il6 from human monocytes in vitroto investigate what may differentiate inflammatory from noninflammatory food extracts stimulants of tolllike receptor tlr 2 and tlr4 were quantified using human embryonic kidney293 cells transfected with each tlr and calibrated with defined bacterial lipopeptide blp and lipopolysaccharide lps standardsthese assays revealed that while most foods contained undetectable levels of tlr2 or tlr4 stimulants all tnfαinducing foods contained stimulants of either tlr2 up to 1100 ng blpequivalentg or tlr4 up to 2700 ng lpsequivalentg in both the soluble and insoluble fractionstlr stimulants were present mainly in meat products and processed foods but were minimal or undetectable in fresh fruit and vegetablesthe capacity of food extracts to induce tnfα secretion in monocytes correlated with the content of both tlr2 r 0837 and tlr4 stimulants r 0748 and was completely abolished by specific inhibition of tlr2 and tlr4lps and blp were found to be highly resistant to typical cooking times and temperatures low ph and protease treatmentin conclusion apparently unspoiled foodstuffs can contain large quantities of stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 both of which may regulate their capacity to stimulate inflammatory signalling
