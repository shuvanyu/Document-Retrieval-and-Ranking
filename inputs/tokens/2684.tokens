background inflammation is a common pathophysiological pathway for a number of chronic diseases and is strongly influenced by sociodemographic factors and lifestyleless is known about factors that may influence the inflammatory response in individuals of distinct ethnic backgroundstherefore this study examined the relationship between ethnicity and blood levels of inflammatory markers in a sample of nonsmoking churchgoersmethods in a crosssectional investigation 508 men and women 35 years old 62 white 38 black participated in the biopsychosocial religion and health substudy of the adventist health study 2the contribution of socioeconomic status education level and difficulty meeting expenses for basic needs and health covariates exercise vegetarian or other type of diet body mass index and presence of inflammatory conditions toward serum levels of creactive protein crp interleukin6 il6 and tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfα was assessed with linear regression modelslevels of interleukin10 il10 an antiinflammatory marker were also assessedresults blacks showed higher levels of crp and il6 than whitescontrolling for sociodemographic and health variables attenuated the ethnic difference in crp while il6 levels remained higher in blacks than in whites β118 95 confidence interval014206 p025ethnic differences in il10 and tnfα were not foundvegetarian diet was associated with lower crp levels while exercise frequency was associated with higher il10 levelsconclusion higher susceptibility of blacks to inflammatory diseases may reflect higher il6 which could be important in assessing health disparities among blacks and whitesvegetarian diet and exercise may counteract effects of disparities
