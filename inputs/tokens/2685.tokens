background the nutritional composition of the dietary intake could produce specific effects on metabolic variables and inflammatory marker concentrationsthis study assessed the effects of two hypocaloric diets legumerestricted vs legumebased diet on metabolic and inflammatory changes accompanying weight lossmethods thirty obese subjects 17 m13f bmi 325  45 kgm2 36  8 years were randomly assigned to one of the following hypocaloric treatments 8 weeks calorierestricted legumefree diet control cdiet or calorierestricted legumebased diet ldiet prescribing 4 weekly different cookedservings 160235 g of lentils chickpeas peas or beansbody composition blood pressure bp blood biochemical and inflammatory marker concentrations as well as dietary intake were measured at baseline and after the nutritional interventionresults the ldiet achieved a greater body weight loss when compared to the cdiet 78  29 vs 53  27 p  0024total and ldl cholesterol levels and systolic bp were improved only when consuming the ldiet p  005ldiet also resulted in a significant higher reduction in creactive protein crp and complement c3 c3 concentrations p  005 compared to baseline and cdiet valuesinterestingly the reduction in the concentrations of crp and c3 remained significantly higher to ldiet group after adjusting by weight loss p  005in addition the reduction  in crp concentrations was positively associated with decreases  in systolic bp and total cholesterol concentration specifically in the ldiet group independent from weight loss p  005conclusion the consumption of legumes 4 servingsweek within a hypocaloric diet resulted in a specific reduction in proinflammatory markers such as crp and c3 and a clinically significant improvement of some metabolic features lipid profile and bp in overweight obese subjects which were in some cases independent from weight loss
