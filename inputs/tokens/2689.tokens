changes in the concentration and composition of serum vldl ldl and hdl were studied in rabbits transferred from chow diets to cholesterolfree semipurified diets containing casein or isolated soy proteinduring the first week on the casein diet there was a marked increase in ldlcholesterol and these higher levels were maintained during the subsequent 3 weeks of the studysimilar but less marked changes were obtained with the soy protein dietwhen the percent composition of the particles was determined both vldl and ldl had a higher proportion of cholesterolturnover studies indicated that the fcrs for radiolabelled vldl and ldl were reduced in caseinfed animals compared to those fed soy proteinthe elevated ldl levels in caseinfed rabbits were primarily due to a reduction in receptormediated catabolism of ldlapo b receptorindependent removal in the two groups was similarthese studies show that the hypercholesterolemia in caseinfed rabbits compared to those fed soy protein is associated with cholesterol enrichment of ldl and impaired receptordependent removal of ldlapo b
