we have compared the effects of dietary soy protein and casein in diets low in cholesterol less than 100 mgd and in diets enriched in cholesterol 500 mgd to examine whether the level of cholesterol intake affects the response of plasma lipoproteins to dietary proteins of plant and animal originnormal men and women consumed formula diets containing 20 of calories as soy protein or casein 27 as fat and 53 as carbohydrate in 2 crossover studiesthe dietary periods lasted for 31 days and were separated by a monthlong interim period on selfchosen foodfollowing an initial reduction of plasma total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol ldlc levels on all diets the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations stabilizedon lowcholesterol diets the concentration of each of the major lipoprotein classes were similar during the soy and the casein dietary periodson cholesterolenriched diets the concentration of ldlc stabilized at a 16 lower level on soy protein than on the casein diet p less than 002 while the concentration of highdensity lipoproteincholesterol hdlc was 16 higher p less than 001since the difference in ldlc p less than 005 and in hdlc p less than 0025 levels on casein and on soy protein diets were significantly greater on the high than on the low cholesterol intake the findings indicate that the level of dietary cholesterol may determine whether plant and animal dietary proteins have similar or different effects on plasma ldlc and hdlc concentrations
