the peptide mixture from housefly pupae has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity but has not previously been reported as a food preservativein this study the preservation effects of a housefly pupae peptide mixture nisin and sodium dehydroacetate dhas on the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria mab total volatile basic nitrogen tvbn and ph value of chilled pork were comparedall results showed that a good preservation effect was observed among 3 treatments with the peptide mixture of housefly pupae nisin and dhas and that there was no significant difference among themthese results indicate that housefly peptide mixture has a great potential as a food preservativethe results of scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy suggest that the primary mechanism of housefly pupae peptide mixture may be bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis and pores induced in the membranespractical applications peptide mixture extracted from housefly pupae using lowcost and simple method has broad spectrum antimicrobial activityaccording to the effect on chilled pork preservation extracted housefly peptide mixture has a great potential as a food preservative
