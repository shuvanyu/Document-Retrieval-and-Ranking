hepatitis e virus hev is an important but extremely understudied pathogenthe mechanisms of hev replication and pathogenesis are poorly understood and a vaccine against hev is not yet availablehev is classified in the family hepeviridae consisting of at least four recognized major genotypesgenotypes 1 and 2 hev are restricted to humans and associated with epidemics in developing countries whereas genotypes 3 and 4 hev are zoonotic and responsible for sporadic cases worldwidethe identification and characterization of a number of animal strains of hev from pigs chickens rabbits rats mongoose deer and possibly cattle and sheep have significantly broadened the host range and diversity of hevthe demonstrated ability of crossspecies infection by some animal strains of hev raises public health concerns for zoonotic hev infectionpigs are a recognized reservoir for hev and pig handlers are at increased risk of zoonotic hev infectionsporadic cases of hepatitis e have been definitively linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked animal meats such as pig livers sausages and deer meatsin addition since large amounts of viruses excreted in feces animal manure land application and runoffs can contaminate irrigation and drinking water with concomitant contamination of produce or shellfishhev rna of swine origin has been detected in swine manure sewage water and oysters and consumption of contaminated shellfish has also been implicated in sporadic cases of hepatitis e therefore the animal strains of hev pose not only a zoonotic risk but also food and environmental safety concerns
