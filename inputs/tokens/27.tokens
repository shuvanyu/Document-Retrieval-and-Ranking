objective to determine the relation of gas passage and abdominal bloating to the production of gas in the colondesign randomized doubleblind crossover study of gaseous symptoms during a 1week periodsetting a veterans affairs medical centerparticipants 25 healthy medical center employeesintervention participants diets were supplemented with either a placebo 10 g of lactulose a nonabsorbable sugar psyllium a fermentable fiber or methylcellulose a nonfermentable fibermeasurements all participants were polled for gaseous symptoms including number of gas passages impression of increased rectal gas and abdominal bloating and five were examined for breath hydrogen excretionresults participants passed gas 10  50 times per day mean  sd during the placebo perioda significant increase in gas passages to 19  12 times per day and a subjective impression of increased rectal gas were reported with lactulose but not with either of the two fiber preparationsbreath hydrogen excretion an indicator of hydrogen production in the colon did not increase after ingestion of either of the fibershowever a statistically significant p  005 increase in feelings of abdominal bloating which the participants perceived as excessive gas in the bowel was reported with both fiber preparations and with lactuloseconclusions the physician should distinguish between excessive gas which indicates excessive gas production and feelings of bloating which are usually unrelated to excessive gas productiontreatment of the former consists of limiting the supply of fermentable material to the colonic bacteriasymptoms of bloating usually indicate the irritable bowel syndrome and therapy should be directed accordingly
