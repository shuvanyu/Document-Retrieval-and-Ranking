there is widespread concern over the presence of hg in fish consumed by humanswhile studies have been focused on determining the hg concentration in sport fish and some commercial fish little attention has been directed to canned tuna it is widely held that concentrations are lowin the present study the amount of hg present in canned tuna purchased in las vegas nevada usa was examined and the brand temporal variation type and packaging medium impacts on hg concentrations in tuna were exploreda significant p  0001 brand difference was noted brand 3 contained higher hg concentrations bar x standard deviation sd 0777  0320 ppm than brands 1 0541  0114 ppm and 2 0550  0199 ppmchunk white tuna 0619  0212 ppm and solid white tuna 0576  0178 ppm were both significantly p  0001 higher in mean hg than chunk light tuna 0137  0063 ppmno significant temporal variation was noted and packaging had no significant effect on hg concentrationin total 55 of all tuna examined was above the us environmental protection agencys us epa safety level for human consumption 05 ppm and 5 of the tuna exceeded the action level established by the us food and drug administration us fda 10 ppmthese results indicate that stricter regulation of the canned tuna industry is necessary to ensure the safety of sensitive populations such as pregnant women infants and childrenaccording to the us epa reference dose of 01 microgkg body weight per day and a mean hg value of 0619 ppm a 25kg child may consume a meal 75 g of canned chunk white tuna only once every 186 d continued monitoring of the industry and efforts to reduce hg concentrations in canned tuna are recommendedenvironcopyright 2009 setac
