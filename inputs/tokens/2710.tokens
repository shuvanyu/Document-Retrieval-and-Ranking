objective to study hair mercury concentrations among women of reproductive age in relation to fish intake in ontario canadastudy design three groups were studied 22 women who had called the motherisk program for information on the reproductive safety of consuming fish during pregnancy a group of japanese residing in toronto n23 consuming much larger amounts of fish and a group of canadian women of reproductive age n20 not seeking advice were studiedmercury concentrations in hair samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryseafood consumption habits were recorded for each participantbased on the types of fish consumed and consumption frequencies the estimated monthly intake of mercury was calculatedhair mercury concentrations were correlated to both the number of monthly seafood servings and the estimated ingested mercury doseresults there were significant correlations between fish servings and hair mercury spearman r073 p0001 and between amounts of consumed mercury and hair mercury concentrations spearman r081 p0001nearly two thirds of the motherisk callers all of the japanese women and 15 of the canadian women of reproductive age had hair mercury above 03 microgg which was shown recently to be the lowest observable adverse effect level in a large systematic review of all perinatal studiesconclusions because of very wide variability general recommendations for a safe number of fish servings may not be sufficient to protect the fetusanalysis of hair mercury may be warranted before pregnancy in selected groups of women consuming more than 12 ounces of fish per week as dietary modification can decrease body burden and ensure fetal safetycopyright c 2010published by mosby inc
