background the associations between different sources of dietary n3 omega3 and n6 omega6 fatty acids and the risk of depression have not been prospectively studiedobjective the objective was to examine the relation between different n3 and n6 types with clinical depression incidencedesign we prospectively studied 54632 us women from the nurses health study who were 5077 y of age and free from depressive symptoms at baselineinformation on diet was obtained from validated foodfrequency questionnairesclinical depression was defined as reporting both physiciandiagnosed depression and regular antidepressant medication useresults during 10 y of followup 19962006 2823 incident cases of depression were documentedintake of longchain n3 fatty acids from fish was not associated with depression risk relative risk rr for 03gd increment 099 95 ci 088 110 whereas Î±linolenic acid ala intake was inversely associated with depression risk multivariate rr for 05gd increment 082 95 ci 071 094the inverse association between ala and depression was stronger in women with low linoleic acid la intake p for interaction  002 a 05gd increment in ala was inversely associated with depression in the first second and third la quintiles rr 95 ci 057 037 087 062 041 093 and 068 047 096 respectively but not in the fourth and fifth quintilesconclusions the results of this large longitudinal study do not support a protective effect of longchain n3 from fish on depression riskalthough these data support the hypothesis that higher ala and lower la intakes reduce depression risk this relation warrants further investigation
