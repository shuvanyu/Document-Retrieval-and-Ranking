pharmaceuticals and personal care products are being increasingly reported in a variety of biological matrices including fish tissue however screening studies have presently not encompassed broad geographical areasa national pilot study was initiated in the united states to assess the accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in fish sampled from five effluentdominated rivers that receive direct discharge from wastewater treatment facilities in chicago illinois dallas texas orlando florida phoenix arizona and west chester pennsylvania usafish were also collected from the gila river new mexico usa as a reference condition expected to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic influencehigh performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analysis of pharmaceuticals revealed the presence of norfluoxetine sertraline diphenhydramine diltiazem and carbamazepine at nanogrampergram concentrations in fillet composites from effluentdominated sampling locations the additional presence of fluoxetine and gemfibrozil was confirmed in liver tissuesertraline was detected at concentrations as high as 19 and 545 ngg in fillet and liver tissue respectivelygas chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analysis of personal care products in fillet composites revealed the presence of galaxolide and tonalide at maximum concentrations of 2100 and 290 ngg respectively and trace levels of triclosanin general more pharmaceuticals were detected at higher concentrations and with greater frequency in liver than in fillet tissueshigher lipid content in liver tissue could not account for this discrepancy as no significant positive correlations were found between accumulated pharmaceutical concentrations and lipid content for either tissue type from any sampling sitein contrast accumulation of the personal care products galaxolide and tonalide was significantly related to lipid contentresults suggest that the detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products was dependent on the degree of wastewater treatment employed
