amnesic shellfish poisoning asp is caused by consumption of shellfish that have accumulated domoic acid a neurotoxin produced by some strains of phytoplanktonthe neurotoxic properties of domoic acid result in neuronal degeneration and necrosis in specific regions of the hippocampusa serious outbreak of asp occurred in canada in 1987 and involved 150 reported cases 19 hospitalisations and 4 deaths after consumption of contaminated musselssymptoms ranged from gastrointestinal disturbances to neurotoxic effects such as hallucinations memory loss and comamonitoring programmes are in place in numerous countries worldwide and closures of shellfish harvesting areas occur when domoic acid concentrations exceed regulatory limitsthis paper reviews the chemistry sources metabolism and toxicology of domoic acid as well as human case reports of asp and discusses a possible mechanism of toxicity
