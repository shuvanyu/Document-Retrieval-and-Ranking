the medicinal properties of curcumin obtained from curcuma longa l cannot be utilised because of poor bioavailability due to its rapid metabolism in the liver and intestinal wallin this study the effect of combining piperine a known inhibitor of hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation was evaluated on the bioavailability of curcumin in rats and healthy human volunteerswhen curcumin was given alone in the dose 2 gkg to rats moderate serum concentrations were achieved over a period of 4 h concomitant administration of piperine 20 mgkg increased the serum concentration of curcumin for a short period of 12 h post drugtime to maximum was significantly increased p  002 while elimination half life and clearance significantly decreased p  002 and the bioavailability was increased by 154on the other hand in humans after a dose of 2 g curcumin alone serum levels were either undetectable or very lowconcomitant administration of piperine 20 mg produced much higher concentrations from 025 to 1 h post drug p  001 at 025 and 05 h p  0001 at 1 h the increase in bioavailability was 2000the study shows that in the dosages used piperine enhances the serum concentration extent of absorption and bioavailability of curcumin in both rats and humans with no adverse effects
