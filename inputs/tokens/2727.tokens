there has been a remarkable paucity of evidence for an association between diet and acneour previous studies suggest that there is an association between milk intake and teenage acnethis is a prospective cohort study to evaluate that relationshipwe studied 6094 girls aged 915 years in 1996 who reported dietary intake on up to three food frequency questionnaires from 1996 to 1998presence and severity of acne was assessed by questionnaire in 1999we computed multivariate prevalence ratios pr and 95 percent confidence intervals for acneafter accounting for age at baseline height and energy intake the multivariate prs 95  ci pvalue for test of trend for acne comparing highest 2 or more servings per day to lowest 1 per week intake categories in 1996 were 120 109 131 0001 for total milk 119 106 132 0001 for whole milk 117 104 131 0002 for low fat milk and 119 108 131 0001 for skim milkthis result did not change appreciably when we excluded girls who reported use of contraceptives and when we restricted our analysis to those younger than 11 years of age at baselinewe found a positive association between intake of milk and acnethis finding supports earlier studies and suggests that the metabolic effects of milk are sufficient to elicit biological responses in consumers
