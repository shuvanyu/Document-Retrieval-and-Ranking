casomorphins are the most important during the first year of life when postnatal formation is most active and milk is the main source of both nutritive and biologically active material for infantsthis study was conducted on a total of 90 infants of which 37 were fed with breast milk and 53 were fed with formula containing cow milkthe study has firstly indicated substances with immunoreactivity of human irhcm and bovine irbcm betacasomorphins7 in blood plasma of naturally and artificially fed infants respectivelyirhcm and irbcm were detected both in the morning before feeding basal level and 3h after feedingelevation of irhcm and irbcm levels after feeding was detected mainly in infants in the first 3 months of lifechromatographic characterization of the material with irbcm has demonstrated that it has the same molecular mass and polarity as synthetic bovine betacasomorphin7the highest basal irhcm was observed in breastfed infants with normal psychomotor development and muscle tonein contrast elevated basal irbcm was found in formulafed infants showing delay in psychomotor development and heightened muscle toneamong formulafed infants with normal development the rate of this parameter directly correlated to basal irbcmthe data indicate that breast feeding has an advantage over artificial feeding for infants development during the first year of life and support the hypothesis for deterioration of bovine casomorphin elimination as a risk factor for delay in psychomotor development and other diseases such as autism
