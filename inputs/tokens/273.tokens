since monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance mgus was first described more than 30 years ago the definition of the entity has evolvedtoday 3 distinct clinical mgus subtypes have been defined nonimmunoglobulin m igm igg or iga mgus igm mgus and light chain mguseach clinical mgus subtype is characterized by unique intermediate stages and progression eventsalthough we now have strong evidence that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by a precursor state at the molecular level there is urgent need to better understand mechanisms that regulate transformation from precursor to fullblown multiple myelomain the future if such knowledge was available it would allow clinicians to define highrisk and lowrisk precursor patients for a more tailored clinical managementalso it would provide insights on the individual patients disease biology which in turn can be used for targeted and more individualized treatment strategieson the basis of current clinical guidelines patients diagnosed with mgus and smoldering myeloma should not be treated outside of clinical trialsin the near future it seems reasonable to believe that highrisk precursor patients will likely become candidates for early treatment strategiesin this review we discuss novel insights from recent studies and propose future directions of relevance for clinical management and research studies2011 aacr
