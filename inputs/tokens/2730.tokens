milk is one of the main source of biologicallyactive peptides that may function as regulatory substances called food hormonesafter passing the gutblood barrier the μopioid receptor agonist and antagonist peptides may become the new factors influencing various functions of the human organismthe aim of the conducted research was to determine the influence of μopioid receptor agonist peptides human and bovine βcasomorphin7 hbbcm7 and antagonistic peptides casoxin6 and d cxn6d on proliferation and cytokine secretion of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcsthe pbmcs proliferation was measured by the use of the brdu test which assesses the dna synthesis activity and the wst1 test which assesses the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymesthe influence of all the investigated peptides on secretion of il4 il8 il13 and ifnγ was determined by the use of the elisa testsincubating the cells with the peptides has not caused any changes to their enzymatic activity which has been proved by a wst1 testwhen using a brdu test however it has been observed that there appear changes to proliferation of pbmcs correlated to amounts of bromodeoxyuridine incorporated into the cellular dnamoreover changes to secretion of il4 and il13 by the cells under the influence of agonists were detected as well as changes to secretion of ifngamma under the influence of all the examined substancesthe obtained results provide information on immunomodulatory effects of foodderived opioid peptides which may be of clinical significance especially in the case of allergic diseases in newbornscopyright  2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
