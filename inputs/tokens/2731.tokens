sudden infant death syndrome sids is the most common cause of death in infants and its pathogenesis is complex and multifactorialthe aim of this review is to summarize recent novel findings regarding the possible association of betacasomorphin betacm to apnea in sids which has not been widely appreciated by pediatricians and scientistsbetacm is an exogenous bioactive peptide derived from casein a major protein in milk and milk products which has opioid activitymechanistically circulation of this peptide into the infants immature central nervous system might inhibit the respiratory center in the brainstem leading to apnea and deaththis paper will review the possible relationship between betacm and sids in the context of passage of betacm through the gastrointestinal tract and the bloodbrain barrier bbb permeability of the bbb to peptides in infants and characterization of the casomorphin system in the brain
