chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke cs induces emphysema by the damage contributed by oxidative stress during inhalation of csingestion of açai fruits euterpe oleracea in animals has both antioxidant and antiinflammatory effectsthis study compared lung damage in mice induced by chronic 60day inhalation of regular cs and smoke from cigarettes containing 100mg of hydroalcoholic extract of açai berry stone cs  asham smokeexposed mice served as the control groupmice were sacrificed on day 60 bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and the lungs were removed for histological and biochemical analyseshistopathological investigation showed enlargement of alveolar space in cs mice compared to cs  a and control micethe increase in leukocytes in the cs group was higher than the increase observed in the cs  a groupoxidative stress as evaluated by antioxidant enzyme activities mieloperoxidase glutathione and 4hydroxynonenal was reduced in mice exposed to csa versus csmacrophage and neutrophil elastase levels were reduced in mice exposed to cs  a versus csthus the presence of açai extract in cigarettes had a protective effect against emphysema in mice probably by reducing oxidative and inflammatory reactionsthese results raise the possibility that addition of açaí extract to normal cigarettes could reduce their harmful effectscopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
