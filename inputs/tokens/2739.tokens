chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is characterised by increased oxidative stressdietary factors such as ample consumption of foods rich in antioxidants such as fruit and vegetables might have beneficial effects in copd patientsthe association between dietary shift to foods rich in antioxidants and lung function in copd was investigated in a 3yr prospective studya total of 120 copd patients were randomised to follow either a diet based on increased consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables intervention group ig or a free diet control group cgthe mean consumption of foods containing antioxidants was higher in the ig than in the cg throughout the study period p005the relationship between consumption of foods rich in antioxidants and percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s was assessed using a general linear model for repeated measures the two groups overall were different in time p  003 with the ig showing a better outcomein investigating the effect of several confounders sex age smoking status comorbid conditions and exacerbation of group response over time nonsignificant interactions were found between confounders group and timethese findings suggest that a dietary shift to higherantioxidant food intake may be associated with improvement in lung function and in this respect dietary interventions might be considered in copd management
