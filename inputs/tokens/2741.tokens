estimation of total antioxidant intake is the first step to investigate the protective effects of antioxidants on oxidative stressmediated diseasethe present study was designed to develop an algorithm to estimate total antioxidant capacity tac of the us diettac of individual antioxidants and 50 popular antioxidantrich food items in the us diet were determined by 22azinobis3ethylbenzthiazoline6sulphonic acid abts assay and the 11diphenyl2picrylhydrazyl dpph assaytheoretical tac of foods was calculated as the sum of individual antioxidant capacities of compoundsthe top 10 tac food items in the us diet according to standard serving size were blueberry  plum  green tea  strawberry  green tea decaffeinated  red wine  grape juice  black tea  cherry  grapemajor contributors to tac were the total phenolic content r  0952 p  0001 and flavonoid content r  0827 p  0001 of 50 foodstheoretical tac was positively correlated to experimental tac of 50 foods determined by the abts assay r  0833 p  0001 and the dpph assay r  0696 p  0001 and to tac from the usda database for the oxygen radical absorbance capacity r  0484 p  0001 n  44the tac database of the us diet has been established and validatedin future studies tac of the us diet can be linked to biomarkers of chronic disease
