objectives to test the efficacy and safety of oral lcitrulline supplementation in improving erection hardness in patients with mild erectile dysfunction edlarginine supplementation improves nitric oxidemediated vasodilation and endothelial function however oral administration has been hampered by extensive presystemic metabolismin contrast lcitrulline escapes presystemic metabolism and is converted to larginine thus setting the rationale for oral lcitrulline supplementation as a donor for the largininenitric oxide pathway of penile erectionmethods in the present singleblind study men with mild ed erection hardness score of 3 received a placebo for 1 month and lcitrulline 15 gd for another monththe erection hardness score number of intercourses per month treatment satisfaction and adverse events were recordedresults a total of 24 patients mean age 565  98 years were entered and concluded the study without adverse eventsthe improvement in the erection hardness score from 3 mild ed to 4 normal erectile function occurred in 2 83 of the 24 men when taking placebo and 12 50 of the 24 men when taking lcitrulline p  01the mean number of intercourses per month increased from 137  093 at baseline to 153  100 at the end of the placebo phase p  57 and 23  137 at the end of the treatment phase p  01all patients reporting an erection hardness score improvement from 3 to 4 reported being very satisfiedconclusions although less effective than phosphodiesterase type5 enzyme inhibitors at least in the short term lcitrulline supplementation has been proved to be safe and psychologically well accepted by patientsits role as an alternative treatment for mild to moderate ed particularly in patients with a psychologically fear of phosphodiesterase type5 enzyme inhibitors deserves further researchcopyright Ã¢ 2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
