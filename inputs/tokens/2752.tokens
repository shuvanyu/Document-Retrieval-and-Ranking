introduction no reported studies exist assessing the relationship between sexual function and hyperlipidemia in womenaim in this study we assessed the domains of sexual function in a representative sample of sexually active premenopausal women with hyperlipidemia but without cardiovascular disease as compared with an agematched female population without hyperlipidemiamethods to be enrolled in the study women had to meet at least one of the following criteria for the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels 160 mgdl highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels 50 mgdl or triglyceride levels 150 mgdllipid parameters were assessed and verified on blood taken at least twice in the hospital during the screening phasefour hundred fortyone premenopausal women with hyperlipidemia were compared with 115 agematched premenopausal women without hyperlipidemiamain outcome measures we used the female sexual function index fsfi for assessing the key dimensions of female sexual functionresults the two groups were well matched for age and smoking prevalencecompared with women of the control group women with hyperlipidemia had reduced mean global fsfi score 228  68 vs 294  49 p  0001individual analysis of the different domains showed that women with hyperlipidemia reported significantly lower arousal orgasm lubrication and satisfaction scores than control womenbased on the total fsfi score 51 of women with hyperlipidemia had scores of 26 or less indicating sexual dysfunction as compared with 21 of women without hyperlipidemia p  0001based on a more conservative analysis including women under the lower quartile of the distribution of fsfi score 32 of women with hyperlipidemia had scores of 23 or less as compared with 9 of women without hyperlipidemia p  0001multiple regression analysis identified age body mass index hdlcholesterol and triglycerides as independent predictors of fsfi scoreconclusions women with hyperlipidemia have significantly lower fsfidomain scores as compared with agematched women without hyperlipidemiahdl cholesterol and triglyceride levels were independently associated with the fsfi score
