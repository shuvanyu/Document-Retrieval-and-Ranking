guillainbarr√© syndrome gbs is a classic failure of the immune system with a lifethreatening attack upon a critical selfcomponentthe active phase of the disease is short concordant with the latency of a primary adaptive immune responsetriggers for gbs include infection and rarely vaccination crossreactivity between infectious and neural epitopes has been well demonstrated particularly for campylobacter jejuni and motor axonal forms of gbs in which nonprotein gangliosides are antigenicmost people are probably exposed to a gbs trigger but only rarely does the disease developwe propose that gbs illustrates competing determinants of the immune systems decision about whether to mount a response and that in unlucky affected individuals copresentation of crossreactive antigens with danger signals activating patternrecognition receptors overcomes normal selfrecognition such that a primary response is initiated that attacks the nervethen in most cases of gbs the response rapidly turns off and second attacks rarely occurthis suggests active restoration of tolerance and specific privileged site attributes of nerve and declining danger signals as the trigger wanes may contribute to this restorationstandard immunosuppression has not been effective in gbswe suggest this is because immune tolerance is already being restored by the time such therapies are initiatedthis in turn suggests that improvements in gbs outcomes are likely to come from better protection of the nerve cells under attack while normal resumption of tolerance is permitted to proceed rather than exploring more aggressive immunosuppressive approaches
