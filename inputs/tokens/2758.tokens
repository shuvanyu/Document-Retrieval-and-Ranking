background workers in poultry plants have high exposure to a variety of transmissible agents present in poultry and their productssubjects in the general population are also exposedit is not known whether many of these agents cause disease in humansif they do we reason this would be readily evident in a highly exposed group such as poultry workerswe report here on mortality from nonmalignant diseases in a cohort of poultry workersmethods mortality was compared with that of the us general population and with that of a comparison group from the same unionrisk was estimated by standardized mortality ratio proportional mortality ratio and directly standardized risk ratioresults poultry workers as a group had an overall excess of deaths from diabetes anterior horn disease and hypertensive disease and a deficit of deaths from intracerebral hemorrhagedeaths from zoonotic bacterial diseases helminthiasis myasthenia gravis schizophrenia other diseases of the spinal cord diseases of the esophagus and peritonitis were nonsignificantly elevated overall by all analyses and significantly so in particular racesex subgroupsconclusions poultry workers may have excess occurrence of disease affecting several organs and systems probably originating from widespread infection with a variety of microorganismsthe results for neurologic diseases could well represent important clues to the etiology of these diseases in humansthe small numbers of deaths involved in some cases limit interpretation
