purpose to determine the effect of curcumin on plasma cells and osteoclasts in patients with mgusexperimental design twentysix patients with mgus were recruited into the study and administered 4 gramsday oral curcuminblood and urine samples were collected at specified visits after initiating therapyfull blood count b2 microglobulin serum paraprotein and immunoglobulin electrophoresis iepg and epg were determined for all patients at each visitserum calcium 25 hydroxyvitamin d3 and bonespecific alkaline phosphatase were determined at baseline onlyurine as a morning secondvoid sample was collected at each visit for urinary ntelopeptide of type i collagenresults our results show that oral curcumin is able to decrease paraprotein load in a select group ie those having a paraprotein level of 20 gl of patients with mgusfifty percent 5 of 10 of these patients had a 12 to 30 reduction in their paraprotein levels while on curcumin therapyin addition 27 of patients on curcumin had a 25 decrease in urinary ntelopeptide of type i collagenconclusion due to the possible progression of mgus to multiple myeloma the potential role of curcumin as a therapeutic intervention for mgus patients warrants further investigation
