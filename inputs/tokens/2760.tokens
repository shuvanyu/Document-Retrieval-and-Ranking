the consumption of meat and other foods of animal origin is a risk factor for several types of cancer but the results for lymphomas are inconclusivetherefore we examined these associations among 411097 participants of the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutritionduring a median followup of 85 years 1334 lymphomas 1267 nonhodgkin lymphoma nhl and 67 hodgkin lymphomas were identifiedconsumption of red and processed meat poultry milk and dairy products was assessed by dietary questionnairescox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the association of the consumption of these food groups with lymphoma riskoverall the consumption of foods of animal origin was not associated with an increased risk of nhls or hl but the associations with specific subgroups of nhl entities were noteda high intake of processed meat was associated with an increased risk of bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia bcll relative risk rr per 50 g intake  131 95 confidence interval ci 106163 but a decreased risk of follicular lymphomas fl rr  058 ci 038089a high intake of poultry was related to an increased risk of bcell lymphomas rr  122 ci 105142 per 10 g intake fl rr  165 ci 118232 and bcll rr  154 ci 118201 in the continuous modelsin conclusion no consistent associations between red and processed meat consumption and lymphoma risk were observed but we found that the consumption of poultry was related to an increased risk of bcell lymphomaschance is a plausible explanation of the observed associations which need to be confirmed in further studies
