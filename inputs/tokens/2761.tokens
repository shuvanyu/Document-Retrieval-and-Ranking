offals are widely consumed in different cuisines but information on the occurrence of dibenzopdioxins dibenzofurans pcddfs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in these foods is sparsein the first structured investigation of its kind this study reports levels of these contaminants in commonly consumed offals n173 such as lamb ox deer and pigs liver kidneys tongue and heart and offal products such as pâté haggis tripe and black puddingthe results support literature observations on the preferential accumulation of contaminants in liver tissue as the highest concentrations of pcddfs were observed in liver relative to the other organs eg84 ng whoteq kg1 lamb liver compared to 11 ng whoteq kg1 lamb kidney and 127 ng whoteq kg1 lamb heartoffal products generally showed lower contaminant levels which may be a result of processing or dilutionfor most samples the main contribution to whoteq arose from pcddfs rather than pcbsjust under half of the lamb liver samples showed pcddf concentrations that exceeded the eu maximum limit of 6 ng kg1 fat weight although deer liver which is not subject to the regulation generally showed higher levelsdietary exposure estimates indicate that the weekly consumption of up to two 100g portions of lamb ox calf or pig liver or one portion of deer liver would not breach the tolerable daily intake tdi level even when the rest of the diet was includedhowever the consumption of more than one portion of deer liver per week may lead to the tdi being exceededcrown copyright  2010published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
