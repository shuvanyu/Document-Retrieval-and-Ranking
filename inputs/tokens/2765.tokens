for many years it was believed that the main function of the large intestine was the resorption of water and salt and the facilitated disposal of waste materialshowever this task definition was far from complete as it did not consider the activity of the microbial content of the large intestinenowadays it is clear that the complex microbial ecosystem in our intestines should be considered as a separate organ within the body with a metabolic capacity which exceeds the liver with a factor 100the intestinal microbiome is therefore closely involved in the firstpass metabolism of dietary compoundsthis is especially true for botanical supplements which are now marketed for various health applicationsbeing of natural origin their structural building blocks such as polyphenols are often highly recognized by the human and especially the intestinal microbial metabolism machineryintensive metabolism results in often low circulating levels of the original products with the consequence that final health effects of botanicals are often related to specific active metabolites which are produced in the body rather than being related to the products original compositionunderstanding how such metabolic processes contribute to the in situ exposure is therefore crucial for the proper interpretation of biological responsesa multidisciplinary approach characterizing the food and phytochemical intake as well as the metabolic potency of the gut microbiota while measuring biomarkers of both exposure and response in target tissues is therefore of critical importancewith polyphenol metabolism as example this review describes how the incorporation of microbial metabolism as an important variable in the evaluation of the final bioactivity of botanicals strongly increases the relevance and predictive value of the outcomemoreover knowledge about intestinal processes may offer innovative strategies for targeted product developmentcopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
