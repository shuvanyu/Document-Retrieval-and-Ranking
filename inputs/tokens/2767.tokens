background alcohol intake has consistently been associated with increased breast cancer incidence in epidemiological studieshowever the relation between alcohol and survival after breast cancer diagnosis is less clearmethods we investigated whether alcohol intake was associated with survival among 3146 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the swedish mammography cohortalcohol consumption was estimated using a food frequency questionnairecox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals 95 cisresults from 1987 to 2008 there were 385 breast cancerspecific deaths and 860 total deathsno significant association was observed between alcohol intake and breast cancerspecific survivalwomen who consumed 10 g per day corresponding to approximately 075 to 1 drinks or more of alcohol had an adjusted hr 95 ci of breast cancerspecific death of 136 082226ptrend047 compared with nondrinkersa significant inverse association was observed between alcohol and nonbreast cancer deathsthose who consumed 3499 g per day of alcohol had a 33 lower risk of death compared with nondrinkers 95 ci 050090ptrend004conclusion our findings suggest that alcohol intake up to approximately one small drink per day does not negatively impact breast cancerspecific survival and a half drink per day is associated with a decreased risk of mortality from other causes
