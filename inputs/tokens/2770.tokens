flavonoids have been hypothesized to reduce cancer riskprevious epidemiological studies conducted to evaluate this hypothesis have not assessed all flavonoids including classes that could contribute to intake among americans which would result in an underestimation of intakethis misclassification could mask variability among individuals resulting in attenuated effect estimates for the association between flavonoids and cancerto augment flavonoid and lignan intake estimates we developed a database that can be used in conjunction with a foodfrequency questionnaire ffqcoupling information derived from the available literature with the us department of agriculture databases we estimated content of 6 flavonoid classes and lignans for 50 food group itemswe combined these estimates with responses from a modified block ffq that was selfcompleted in 19961997 by a populationbased sample of women without breast cancer on long island new york n  1500total flavonoid and lignan content of food items ranged from 0 to 129 mg100 g and the richest sources were tea cherries and grapefruitindividual intake estimates from highest to lowest were flavan3ols flavanones flavonols lignans isoflavones anthocyanidins and flavoneseach class of flavonoids and lignans exhibited a wide range of intake levelsthis database is useful to quantify flavonoid and lignan intake for other observational studies conducted in the united states that utilize the block ffq
