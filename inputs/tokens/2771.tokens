little is known about the effects of diet after breast cancer diagnosis on survivalwe prospectively examined the relation between postdiagnosis dietary factors and breast cancer and allcause survival in women with a history of invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1987 and 1999 at ages 2079 yearsdiet after breast cancer diagnosis was measured using a 126item food frequency questionnaireamong 4441 women without a history of breast cancer recurrence prior to completing the questionnaire 137 subsequently died from breast cancer within 7 years of enrollmenthazard ratios hr and 95 confidence intervals ci were estimated for intake of macronutrients as well as selected micronutrients and food groups from cox proportional hazards regression modelsafter adjustment for factors at diagnosis age state of residence menopausal status smoking breast cancer stage alcohol history of hormone replacement therapy interval between diagnosis and diet assessment and at followup energy intake breast cancer treatment body mass index and physical activity women in the highest compared to lowest quintile of intake of saturated fat and trans fat had a significantly higher risk of dying from any cause hr  141 95 ci  106 to 187 ptrend  003 for saturated fat hr  178 95 ci  135 to 232 ptrend  001 for trans fat intakeassociations were similar though did not achieve statistical significance for breast cancer survivalthis study suggests that lower intake of saturated and trans fat in the postdiagnosis diet is associated with improved survival after breast cancer diagnosis
