research leading to the discovery of a series of mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines hcas was inspired by the idea that smoke produced during cooking of food especially meat or fish might be carcinogenicmore than ten kinds of hcas actually produced by cooking or heating of meat or fish have now been isolated and their structures determined most being previously unregistered compoundsthey are highly mutagenic towards salmonella typhimurium in the presence of s9 mix and are also mutagenic in vitro and in vivo toward mammalian cellshcas have now been chemically synthesized in quantity and subjected to longterm animal testingwhen hcas were fed in the diet rodents developed cancers in many organs including the colon breast and prostate and one hca produced hepatomas in monkeysthe lesions exhibited alteration in genes including apc betacatenin and haras and these changes provide clues to the induction mechanismsthe hcas are oxidized to hydroxyamino derivatives by cytochrome p450s and further converted to ester forms by acetyltransferase and sulfotransferaseeventually they produce dna adducts through the formation of nc bonds at guanine basesthere are hcasensitive and resistant strains of rodents and a search for the responsible genes is now under waywhile the content of hcas in dishes consumed in ordinary life is low and not sufficient in itself to explain human cancer the coexistence of many other mutagenscarcinogens of either autobiotic or xenobiotic type and the possibility that hcas induce genomic instability and heightened sensitivity to tumor promoters suggest that avoidance of exposure to hcas or reduction of hcas biological effects as far as possible are to be highly recommendedusage of microwave ovens for cooking and supplementation of the diet for example with soyisoflavones which have been found to suppress the occurrence of hcainduced breast cancers should be encouragedadvice to the general public about how to reduce the carcinogenic load imposed by hcas would be an important contribution to cancer prevention
