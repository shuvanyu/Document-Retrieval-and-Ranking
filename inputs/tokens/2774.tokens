the aim of this study was to determine the bioavailability and kinetics of the supposed anticarcinogen sulforaphane the hydrolysis product of glucoraphanin from raw and cooked broccolieight men consumed 200 g of crushed broccoli raw or cooked with a warm meal in a randomized freeliving open crossover trialhigher amounts of sulforaphane were found in the blood and urine when broccoli was eaten raw bioavailability of 37 versus cooked 34 p  0002absorption of sulforaphane was delayed when cooked broccoli was consumed peak plasma time  6 h versus raw broccoli 16 h p  0001excretion halflives were comparable 26 and 24 h on average for raw and cooked broccoli respectively p  05this study gives complete kinetic data and shows that consumption of raw broccoli results in faster absorption higher bioavailability and higher peak plasma amounts of sulforaphane compared to cooked broccoli
