ultraviolet uv of sunlight is a complete carcinogen that can burn skin enhance inflammation and drive skin carcinogenesispreviously we have shown that sulforaphane sfn inhibited chemically induced skin carcinogenesis via nuclear factor erythroidderived 2like 2 nrf2 and others have shown that broccoli sprout extracts containing high sfn protected against uvinduced skin carcinogenesis in skh1 hairless micea recent study showed that there was no difference between nrf2 knockout nrf2 ko and nrf2 wildtype wt balbc mice after exposing to high dose of uvbsince nrf2 plays critical roles in the antioxidative stressantiinflammatory responses it is relevant to assess the role of nrf2 for photoprotection against uvin this context the role of nrf2 in uvbinduced skin inflammation in nrf2 wt and nrf2 ko c57bl6 mice was studieda single dose of uvb 300 mjcm2 resulted in skin inflammation in both wt and nrf2 ko  mice ko mice at 8 h and 8 d following uvb irradiationin the wt mice inflammation returned to the basal level to a greater extent when compared to the ko micesfn treatment of nrf2 wt but not nrf2 ko mice restored the number of sunburn cells back to their basal level by 8 d after uvb irradiationadditionally uvbinduced shortterm inflammatory biomarkers interleukin1β and interleukin6 were increased in the ko mice and uvbinduced apoptotic cells in the ko mice were significantly higher as compared to that in the wttaken together our results show that functional nrf2 confers a protective effect against uvbinduced inflammation sunburn reaction and sfnmediated photoprotective effects in the skincopyright  2010 wileyliss inc
