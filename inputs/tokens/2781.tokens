the objective of this study was to investigate whether the plantderived isothiocyanate sulforaphane sfn enhances the antitumor activities of the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin ox in a cell culture model of colorectal cancercaco2 cells were cultured under standard conditions and treated with increasing concentrations of sfn 120 μm andor ox 100 nm10 μmfor coincubation cells were pretreated with sfn for 24 h cell growth was determined by brdu incorporationdrug interactions were assessed using the combinationindex method ci cl  1 indicates synergismapoptotic events were characterized by different elisa techniquesprotein levels were examined by western blot analysisannexin v and propidium iodide pi staining followed by facs analysis was used to differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic eventssfn and ox alone inhibited cell growth of caco2 cells in a dosedependent manner an effect which could be synergistically enhanced when cells were incubated with the combination of both agentscotreated cells further displayed distinctive morphological changes that occurred during the apoptotic process such as cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine membrane blebbing as well as the occurence of cytoplasmic histoneassociated dna fragmentsfurther observations thereby pointed toward simultaneous activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathwayswith increasing concentrations and treatment duration a shift from apoptotic to necrotic cell death could be observedin conclusion the data suggest that the isothiocyanate sfn sensitizes colon cancer cells to oxinduced cell growth inhibition via induction of different modes of cell death
