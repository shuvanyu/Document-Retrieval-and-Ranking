chondrocyte cell death can contribute to cartilage degeneration in articular diseases such as osteoarthritis oasulforaphane sfn a natural compound derived from cruciferous aliment is well known as an anticarcinogen but according to recent evidence it also shows cytoprotective effects on a variety of nontumoral cellstherefore we have tested the ability of sfn to protect chondrocytes from cell death in vitrotreatment of growing monolayer cultures of human c28i2 chondrocytes with sfn in the low micromolecular range for a few days reduced cell growth without affecting cell survival or inducing apoptosishowever it decreased cell death in c28i2 chondrocytes exposed to stimuli previously reported to promptly trigger apoptosis that is the cytokine tumor necrosis factorα tnf plus cycloheximide chx or the polyamine analogue n1n11diethylnorspermine denspm plus chxin particular pretreatment with sfn reduced effector and initiator caspase activities and the associated activation of jnk kinasessfn exerted a cytoprotective action even versus h2o2  which differently from the previous stimuli induced cell death without producing an evident caspase activationsfn pretreatment also prevented caspase activation in threedimensional micromass cultures of oa chondrocytes stimulated with growthrelated oncogene α groα a proapoptotic chemokinethe suppression of caspase activation in micromasses appeared to be related to the inhibition of p38 mapk phosphorylationin conclusion the present work shows that low micromolecular sfn concentrations exert prosurvival and antiapoptotic actions and influence signaling pathways in a variety of experimental conditions employing chondrocyte cell lines and oa chondrocytes treated with a range of death stimulicopyright  2010 wileyliss inc
