many constituents present in the human diet may inhibit endogenous formation of nnitroso compounds nocstudies with human volunteers showed inhibiting effects of intake of ascorbic acid and green tea consumption on nitrosation using the nnitrosoproline testthe aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of ascorbic acid and green tea on urinary excretion of carcinogenic nnitrosodimethylamine ndma and nnitrosopiperidine npip in humanstwentyfive healthy female volunteers consumed a fish meal rich in amines as nitrosatable precursors in combination with intake of nitratecontaining drinking water at the acceptable daily intake level during 7 consecutive daysduring 1 week before and after nitrate intake a diet low in nitrate was consumedusing the same protocol the effect of two different doses of ascorbic acid 250 mg and 1 gday and two different doses of green tea 2 g and 4 gday on formation of ndma and npip was studiedmean nitrate excretion in urine significantly increased from control 7624 to 16725 mg24 h intake of nitrate and fish resulted in a significant increase in mean urinary excretion of ndma compared with the control weeks 871430 and 640277 ng24 h during days 13 and 47 respectively compared with 385196 ng24 h p00002excretion of npip in urine was not related to nitrate intake and composition of the dietintake of 250 mg and 1 g of ascorbic acid per day resulted in a significant decrease in urinary ndma excretion during days 47 p00001 but not during days 13also consumption of four cups of green tea per day 2 g significantly decreased excretion of ndma during days 47 p00035 but not during days 13surprisingly consumption of eight cups of green tea per day 4 g significantly increased ndma excretion during days 47 p00001 again not during days 13this increase is probably a result of catalytic effects of tea polyphenols on nitrosation or of another yet unknown mechanismthese results suggest that intake of ascorbic acid and moderate consumption of green tea can reduce endogenous ndma formation
