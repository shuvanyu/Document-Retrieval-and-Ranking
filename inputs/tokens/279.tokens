monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance mgus and smoldering multiple myeloma smm represent useful models for studying multiple myeloma precursor disease and for developing early intervention strategiesadministering a 4g dose of curcumin we performed a randomised doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover study followed by an openlabel extension study using an 8g dose to assess the effect of curcumin on flc response and bone turnover in patients with mgus and smm36 patients 19 mgus and 17 smm were randomised into two groups one received 4g curcumin and the other 4g placebo crossing over at 3 monthsat completion of the 4g arm all patients were given the option of entering an openlabel 8g dose extension studyblood and urine samples were collected at specified intervals for specific marker analysesgroup values are expressed as mean  1 sddata from different time intervals within groups were compared using students paired ttest25 patients completed the 4g crossover study and 18 the 8g extension studycurcumin therapy decreased the free lightchain ratio rflc reduced the difference between clonal and nonclonal lightchain dflc and involved free lightchain iflcudpyd a marker of bone resorption decreased in the curcumin arm and increased on the placebo armserum creatinine levels tended to diminish on curcumin therapythese findings suggest that curcumin might have the potential to slow the disease process in patients with mgus and smmcopyright  2012 wiley periodicals inc
