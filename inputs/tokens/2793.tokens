the deleterious effects of tumorpromoting tobacco carcinogen nitrosamine 4methylnitrosamino13pyridyl1butanone nnk nicotinederived nitrosamine ketone have undoubtedly been stipulatedthough many tobacco agents play a part in the development of lung tumors the potent effects of nnk remain unmatchedit is therefore critical to distinguish the variety of cofactors involved in nnkmediated pathogenesis and the unique pathways necessary for successful cellular biotransformationcurrent reviews have consistently identified the strengths of nnk and prospective tumor capabilitiesothers have delineated specific cellular factors mediating nnk and lung tumors and have identified metabolic and signaling pathways largely responsible for nnk activation and tumorigenic initiationunique to this review is that it summarizes the extensive network of cofactors and cellular mechanisms that promote nnkspecific lung tumorigenesisas such it displays a fuller more comprehensive overview bringing us one step closer to understanding the fatal consequences of nnk thus discovering new avenues that successfully break the cycle of nnkmediated lung carcinogenesis
