purpose to perform pattern analyses of dietary and lifestyle factors in relation to risk of esophageal and gastric cancersmethods we evaluated risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma ea esophageal squamous cell carcinoma escc gastric cardia adenocarcinoma gca and other gastric cancers oga using data from a populationbased casecontrol study conducted in connecticut new jersey and western washington statedietarylifestyle patterns were created using principal component analysis pcaimpact of the resultant scores on cancer risk was estimated through logistic regressionresults pca identified six patterns meatnitrite fruitvegetable smokingalcohol legumemeat alternate gerdbmi and fishvitamin c risk of each cancer under study increased with rising meatnitrite scorerisk of ea increased with increasing gerdbmi score and risk of escc rose with increasing smokingalcohol score and decreasing gerdbmi scorefruitvegetable scores were inversely associated with ea escc and gcaconclusions pca may provide a useful approach for summarizing extensive dietarylifestyle data into fewer interpretable combinations that discriminate between cancer cases and controlsthe analyses suggest that meatnitrite intake is associated with elevated risk of each cancer under study while fruitvegetable intake reduces risk of ea escc and gcagerdobesity were confirmed as risk factors for ea and smokingalcohol as risk factors for escc
