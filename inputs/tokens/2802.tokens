background meat could be involved in bladder carcinogenesis via multiple potentially carcinogenic meatrelated compounds related to cooking and processing including nitrate nitrite heterocyclic amines hcas and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonswe comprehensively investigated the association between meat and meat components and bladder cancermethods during 7 years of followup 854 transitional cell bladder cancer cases were identified among 300933 men and women who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire in the large prospective nihaarp diet and health studywe estimated intake of nitrate and nitrite from processed meat and hcas and pahs from cooked meat using quantitative databases of measured valueswe calculated total dietary nitrate and nitrite based on literature valuesresults the hazard ratios hr and 95 confidence intervals ci for red meat hr for fifth compared to first quintile122 95 ci096154 ptrend007 and the hca 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip hr119 95 ci095148 ptrend006 conferred a borderline statistically significant increased risk of bladder cancerwe observed positive associations in the top quintile for total dietary nitrite hr128 95 ci102161 ptrend 006 and nitrate plus nitrite intake from processed meat hr129 95 ci100167 ptrend 011conclusions these findings provide modest support for a role for total dietary nitrite and nitrate plus nitrite from processed meat in bladder cancerour results also suggest a positive association between red meat and phip and bladder carcinogenesis
