background the evidence that red and processed meat influences colorectal carcinogenesis was judged convincing in the 2007 world cancer research fundamerican institute of cancer research reportsince then ten prospective studies have published new resultshere we update the evidence from prospective studies and explore whether there is a nonlinear association of red and processed meats with colorectal cancer riskmethods and findings relevant prospective studies were identified in pubmed until march 2011for each study relative risks and 95 confidence intervals ci were extracted and pooled with a randomeffects model weighting for the inverse of the variance in highest versus lowest intake comparison and doseresponse metaanalysesred and processed meats intake was associated with increased colorectal cancer riskthe summary relative risk rr of colorectal cancer for the highest versus the lowest intake was 122 95 ci   111134 and the rr for every 100 gday increase was 114 95 ci   104124nonlinear doseresponse metaanalyses revealed that colorectal cancer risk increases approximately linearly with increasing intake of red and processed meats up to approximately 140 gday where the curve approaches its plateauthe associations were similar for colon and rectal cancer riskwhen analyzed separately colorectal cancer risk was related to intake of fresh red meat rr for 100 gday increase   117 95 ci   105131 and processed meat rr for 50 gday increase   118 95 ci   110128similar results were observed for colon cancer but for rectal cancer no significant associations were observedconclusions high intake of red and processed meat is associated with significant increased risk of colorectal colon and rectal cancersthe overall evidence of prospective studies supports limiting red and processed meat consumption as one of the dietary recommendations for the prevention of colorectal cancer
