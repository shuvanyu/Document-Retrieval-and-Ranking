nitrosamines mediate their mutagenic effects by causing dna damage oxidative stress lipid peroxidation and proinflammatory cytokine activation which lead to increased cellular degeneration and deathhowever the very same pathophysiological processes comprise the unbuilding blocks of aging and insulinresistance diseases including neurodegeneration diabetes mellitus dm and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nashprevious studies demonstrated that experimental exposure to streptozotocin a nitrosaminerelated compound causes nash and diabetes mellitus types 1 2 and 3 alzheimer adtype neurodegenerationherein we review evidence that the upwardly spiraling trends in mortality rates due to dm ad and parkinsons disease typify exposure rather than geneticbased disease models and parallel the progressive increases in human exposure to nitrates nitrites and nitrosamines via processedpreserved foodswe propose that such chronic exposures have critical roles in the pathogenesis of our insulin resistance disease pandemicpotential solutions include 1 eliminating the use of nitrites in food 2 reducing nitrate levels in fertilizer and water used to irrigate crops and 3 employing safe and effective measures to detoxify food and water prior to human consumptionfuture research efforts should focus on refining our ability to detect and monitor human exposures to nitrosamines and assess early evidence of nitrosaminemediated tissue injury and insulin resistance
