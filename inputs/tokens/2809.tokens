objective nnitroso compounds nocs are recognized neural carcinogens in animal models and are suspected human carcinogensa metaanalysis was performed examining the possible association of maternal intake of cured meat an important source of dietary nocs during pregnancy and the risk of pediatric brain tumorsmethods data from epidemiological studies were pooled using a general variancebased metaanalytic method employing confidence intervals described by greenland in 1986the outcome of interest was a summary relative risk rr reflecting the risk of childhood brain tumor cbt development associated with maternal intake of cured meats during pregnancysensitivity analyses were performed when necessary to explain any observed statistical heterogeneityresults seven observational studies were found that met the protocolspecified inclusion criteriaanalysis for heterogeneity demonstrated a lack of statistical heterogeneity p  059 indicating that the data could be statistically combinedpooling data from the 6 reports containing data on maternal cured meat intake of all types yielded an rr of 168 130 217 being a statistically significant resultanalyzing cbt risk by type of cured meat ingested showed that hot dog consumption increased cbt risk by 33 108166 with a similar increase shown by frequent ingestion of sausage ie44conclusion the data provide support for the suspected causal association between ingestion of nocs from cured meats during pregnancy and subsequent cbt in offspringlimitations in study design preclude definitive conclusions but the relationship warrants exploration via additional observational and laboratorybased studiescopyright 2004 s karger ag basel
