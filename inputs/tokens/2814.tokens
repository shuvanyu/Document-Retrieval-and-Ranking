fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy were used to study the cell injury and inactivation of campylobacter jejuni from exposure to antioxidants from garlicc jejuni was treated with various concentrations of garlic concentrate and garlicderived organosulfur compounds in growth media and saline at 4 22 and 35cthe antimicrobial activities of the diallyl sulfides increased with the number of sulfur atoms diallyl sulfide  diallyl disulfide  diallyl trisulfideftir spectroscopy confirmed that organosulfur compounds are responsible for the substantial antimicrobial activity of garlic much greater than those of garlic phenolic compounds as indicated by changes in the spectral features of proteins lipids and polysaccharides in the bacterial cell membranesconfocal raman microscopy 532nmgoldparticle substrate and raman mapping of a single bacterium confirmed the intracellular uptake of sulfur and phenolic componentsscanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem were employed to verify cell damageprincipalcomponent analysis pca discriminant function analysis dfa and soft independent modeling of class analogs simca were performed and results were cross validated to differentiate bacteria based upon the degree of cell injurypartial leastsquares regression plsr was employed to quantify and predict actual numbers of healthy and injured bacterial cells remaining following treatmentplsrbased loading plots were investigated to further verify the changes in the cell membrane of c jejuni treated with organosulfur compoundswe demonstrated that bacterial injury and inactivation could be accurately investigated by complementary infrared and raman spectroscopies using a chemicalbased wholeorganism fingerprint with the aid of chemometrics and electron microscopy
