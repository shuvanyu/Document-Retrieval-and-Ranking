beeturia the passage of pink or red urine after the ingestion of beetroot is said to occur in 1014 of the population and is more common in iron deficiency and malabsorptiona specific hplc assay for betacyanins the red beetroot pigments in biological fluids was developed to study the prevalence of this apparent polymorphism in humans and to investigate its basis in ratstwo major peaks were observed in chromatograms of extracts of unpickled beetrootthey had identical uv absorption spectra lambda max  535 nm by diode array analysis and mass spectrometry indicated that one betacyanin 1 was betanin or its epimer and the other betacyanin 2 a disaccharide of betacyanin 1in a population of 100 normal subjects the 08 h urinary recoveries after an oral dose of 60 mg beetroot extract were 006054 for betacyanin 1 and 00106 for betacyanin 2the distributions of these data were skewed but not clearly bimodal by visual inspection or by kernel density analysisfour subjects produced visibly red urine and had betacyanin recoveries at the upper end of the population rangestudies using in situ isolated perfused rat jejunum and liver preparations indicated a negligible absorption of the pigments after 1 h and no detectable metabolism or biliary secretionintact anaesthetized rats given ivbolus doses of beetroot extract cleared both betacyanins from plasma at the rate of 33  09 sd ml min1 n  5the total urinary recovery of both pigments amounted to 80 of the dose and their renal clearances approached their plasma clearancesthese data suggest that beeturia does not arise from deficiencies in hepatic metabolism or renal excretion of betacyaninsafter oral administration of beetroot extract to rats the betacyanin content of the stomach decreased rapidly with time but neither the intestines nor the bile duct were stained visibly redthese findings together with those showing instability of the betacyanins in acid conditions suggest that variability in the biological fate of beetroot pigments may be determined largely by gastric ph and emptying rate
