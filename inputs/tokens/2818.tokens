the anion nitrateabundant in our diethas recently emerged as a major pool of nitric oxide no synthaseindependent no productionnitrate is reduced stepwise in vivo to nitrite and then no and possibly other bioactive nitrogen oxidesthis reductive pathway is enhanced during low oxygen tension and acidosisa recent study shows a reduction in oxygen consumption during submaximal exercise attributable to dietary nitratewe went on to study the effects of dietary nitrate on various physiological and biochemical parameters during maximal exercisenine healthy nonsmoking volunteers age 3023 years vo2max 372033 lmin participated in this study which had a randomized doubleblind crossover designsubjects received dietary supplementation with sodium nitrate 01 mmolkgday or placebo nacl for 2 days before the testthis dose corresponds to the amount found in 100300 g of a nitraterich vegetable such as spinach or beetrootthe maximal exercise tests consisted of an incremental exercise to exhaustion with combined arm and leg cranking on two separate ergometersdietary nitrate reduced vo2max from 372033 to 362031 lmin p005despite the reduction in vo2max the time to exhaustion trended to an increase after nitrate supplementation 52431 vs 56330 s p013there was a correlation between the change in time to exhaustion and the change in vo2max r2047 p004a moderate dietary dose of nitrate significantly reduces vo2max during maximal exercise using a large active muscle massthis reduction occurred with a trend toward increased time to exhaustion implying that two separate mechanisms are involved one that reduces vo2max and another that improves the energetic function of the working musclescopyright 2009 elsevier inc all rights reserved
