hypercholesterolemia is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseasesome but not all studies have shown that soy protein intake decreases total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increases highdensity lipoprotein cholesterolthe objective of this metaanalysis was to examine the effect of soy protein supplementation on serum lipid levels in adultsenglish language articles were retrieved by searching medline 1966 to february 2005 and the bibliographies of the retrieved articlesa total of 41 randomized controlled trials in which isolated soy protein supplementation was the only intervention and the net changes in serum lipids during intervention were reportedinformation on study design sample size participant characteristics intervention followup duration and treatment outcomes was independently abstracted using a standardized protocolusing a randomeffects model data from each study were pooled and weighted by the inverse of their variancesoy protein supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in mean serum total cholesterol 526 mgdl 95 confidence interval ci 714 to 338 lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol 425 mgdl 95 ci 600 to 250 and triglycerides 626 mgdl 95 ci 914 to 338 and a significant increase in highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol 077 mgdl 95 ci 020 to 134metaregression analyses showed a doseresponse relation between soy protein and isoflavone supplementation and net changes in serum lipidsthese results indicate that soy protein supplementation reduces serum lipids among adults with or without hypercholesterolemiain conclusion replacing foods high in saturated fat transsaturated fat and cholesterol with soy protein may have a beneficial effect on coronary risk factors
