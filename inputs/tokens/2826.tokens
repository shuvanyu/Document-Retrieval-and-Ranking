background vitamin b₁₂ deficiency is common among the elderly and early detection is clinically importanthowever clinical signs and symptoms have limited diagnostic accuracy and there is no accepted reference test methodmethods in elderly subjects n  700 age range 6397 years we investigated the ability of serum cobalamin holotranscobalamin holotc total homocysteine thcy methylmalonic acid mma serum and erythrocyte folate and other hematologic variables to discriminate cobalamin deficiency defined as red blood cell cobalamin 33 pmollresults serum holotc was the best predictor with area under the roc curve 95 ci 090 086093 and this was significantly better p  00002 than the next best predictors serum cobalamin 080 075085 and mma 078 072083for these 3 analytes we constructed a 3zone partition of positive and negative zones and a deliberate indeterminate zone betweenthe boundaries were values of each test that resulted in a posttest probability of deficiency of 60 and a posttest probability of no deficiency of 98the proportion of indeterminate observations for holotc cobalamin and mma was 14 45 and 50 respectivelywithin the holotc indeterminate zone defined as 2030 pmoll discriminant analysis selected only erythrocyte folate which correctly allocated 65 5889 of the observationsrenal dysfunction compromised the diagnostic accuracy of mma but not holotc or serum cobalaminconclusions this study supports the use of holotc as the firstline diagnostic procedure for vitamin b₁₂ status
