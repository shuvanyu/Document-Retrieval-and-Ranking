background data on the longterm association between lowcarbohydrate diets and mortality are sparseobjective to examine the association of lowcarbohydrate diets with mortality during 26 years of followup in women and 20 years in mendesign a prospective cohort study of women and men followed from 1980 women or 1986 men until 2006lowcarbohydrate diets either animalbased emphasizing animal sources of fat and protein or vegetablebased emphasizing vegetable sources of fat and protein were computed from multiple validated food frequency questionnaire assessed during followupsetting nurses health study and health professionals followup study participants 85168 women aged 3459 years at baseline and 44548 men aged 4075 years at baseline without heart disease cancer or diabetesmeasurement investigator documented 12555 deaths 2458 cardiovascular 5780 cancer in women and 8678 deaths 2746 cardiovascular 2960 cancer in menresults the overall lowcarbohydrate score was associated with a modest increase in overall mortality in pooled analysis hazard ratio hr comparing extreme deciles112 95 ci101124 ptrend014the animal lowcarbohydrate score was associated with a higher allcause mortality pooled hr comparing extreme deciles123 95 ci111137 ptrend005 cardiovascular mortality corresponding hr114 95 ci101129 ptrend0029 and cancer mortality corresponding hr128 95 ci 102160 p for trend  009in contrast a higher vegetable lowcarbohydrate score was associated with lower allcause hr080 95 ci075085 ptrend0001 and cardiovascular mortality hr077 95 ci068087 ptrend0001limitations diet and lifestyle characteristics were assessed with some degree of error however sensitivity analyses indicated that results were not unlikely to be substantially affected by residual or confounding or an unmeasured confounderin addition participants were not a representative sample of the us populationconclusion a lowcarbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with higher allcause mortality in both men and women whereas a vegetablebased lowcarbohydrate diet was associated with lower allcause and cardiovascular disease mortality ratesprimary funding source nih grants ca87969 hl60712 and ca95589
