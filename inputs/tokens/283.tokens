objective to measure proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli antibody levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra during treatment by vegetarian dietmethods sera were collected from 53 ra patients who took part in a controlled clinical trial of fasting and a one year vegetarian dietp mirabilis and e coli antibody levels were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and an enzyme immunoassay respectivelyresults the patients on the vegetarian diet had a significant reduction in the mean antiproteus titres at all time points during the study compared with baseline values all p  005no significant change in titre was observed in patients who followed an omnivorous dietthe decrease in antiproteus titre was greater in the patients who responded well to the vegetarian diet compared with diet nonresponders and omnivoresthe total igg concentration and levels of antibody against e coli however were almost unchanged in all patient groups during the trialthe decrease from baseline in proteus antibody levels correlated significantly p  0001 with the decrease in a modified stoke disease activity indexconclusion the decrease in p mirabilis antibody levels in the diet responders and the correlation between the decrease in proteus antibody level and decrease in disease activity supports the suggestion of an aetiopathogenetic role for p mirabilis in ra
