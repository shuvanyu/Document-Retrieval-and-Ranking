evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction is on the causal pathway for both atherogenesis and destabilization of established plaquesin this review the role of flowmediated dilatation fmd as a noninvasive method to assess endothelial function is discussedtechnical modifications and development of analysis software have significantly improved the variability of the methodfollowing a strict standardized protocol enables reproducible measurements to be achieved and export of the technique from specialized laboratories to population studies and multicentre settingsendothelial function assessed by fmd has been shown to be affected by cardiovascular risk factors to be related to structural arterial disease and to cardiovascular outcome validating its use for studying the pathophysiology of arterial diseasenumerous studies have also demonstrated that it is responsive to physiological and pharmacological interventionsflowmediated dilatation provides unique opportunities in drug development programmes to assess an early rapidly responsive signal of risk or benefit complementing endpoints of structural arterial disease and cardiovascular outcomes that take much longer and are more expensive
