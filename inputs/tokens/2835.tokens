this review summarizes the multifaceted aspects of antioxidants and the basic kinetic models of inhibited autoxidation and analyzes the chemical principles of antioxidant capacity assaysdepending upon the reactions involved these assays can roughly be classified into two types assays based on hydrogen atom transfer hat reactions and assays based on electron transfer etthe majority of hatbased assays apply a competitive reaction scheme in which antioxidant and substrate compete for thermally generated peroxyl radicals through the decomposition of azo compoundsthese assays include inhibition of induced lowdensity lipoprotein autoxidation oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac total radical trapping antioxidant parameter trap and crocin bleaching assaysetbased assays measure the capacity of an antioxidant in the reduction of an oxidant which changes color when reducedthe degree of color change is correlated with the samples antioxidant concentrationsetbased assays include the total phenols assay by folinciocalteu reagent fcr trolox equivalence antioxidant capacity teac ferric ion reducing antioxidant power frap total antioxidant potential assay using a cuii complex as an oxidant and dpphin addition other assays intended to measure a samples scavenging capacity of biologically relevant oxidants such as singlet oxygen superoxide anion peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical are also summarizedon the basis of this analysis it is suggested that the total phenols assay by fcr be used to quantify an antioxidants reducing capacity and the orac assay to quantify peroxyl radical scavenging capacityto comprehensively study different aspects of antioxidants validated and specific assays are needed in addition to these two commonly accepted assays
