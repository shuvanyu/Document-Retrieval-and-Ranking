the sap of croton lechleri muellarg euphorbiaceae called dragons blood is used in folk medicine as a cicatrizant antiinflammatory and to treat cancerin this research the antioxidant activity of croton lechleri sap was evaluated against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and against maize plantlets treated with the oxidative agents apomorphine and hydrogen peroxidethe mutagenic activity of the sap was also analyzed using the salmonellamicrosome assay salmonella typhimurium ta97a ta98 ta100 ta102 ta1535 and in cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiaethe results showed that croton lechleri sap possesses significant antioxidant activity against the oxidative damages induced by apomorphine in saccharomyces cerevisiae under all the conditions studiedhowever in the case of hydrogen peroxide antioxidant activity of the sap was detected only in cells in the stationary phase of growththe sap was also able to protect cells of the maize plantlets from the toxic effect of apomorphinethis sap showed mutagenic activity for strain ta1535 of salmonella typhimurium in the presence of metabolic activation and a weak mutagenic activity for strain ta98these strains detect base pair substitutions and frameshift mutations respectivelymutagenicity was also observed in a haploid saccharomyces cerevisiae strain xv18514c for the lys11 his17 locusspecific reversion and hom310 frameshift mutations
