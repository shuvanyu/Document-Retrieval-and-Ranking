the cytotoxic effects of triphala tpl an indian ayurvedic formulation with known anticancer properties has been investigated on two human breast cancer cell lines differing in their p53 statusin vitro studies showed that mcf 7 with wild type p53 was more sensitive to tpl than t 47 d which is p53 negativetpl induced loss of cell viability was determined by mtt assayafter 72h incubation the ic 50 values for mcf 7 was found to be approximately 8microgml and that for t 47 d was approximately 26microgmlmoreover tpl inhibited the clonogenic growth of mcf 7 cells which was significantly recovered by pifithrinalpha the p53 inhibitorhowever pifithrinalpha did not modify tpl induced cytotoxicity in t 47 d cellsexogenous addition of antioxidants glutathione gsh and nacetylcysteine nac inhibited the antiproliferative ability of tpl in both mcf 7 and t47 d annexinv and propidium iodide double staining of cells treated with tpl for 2h revealed that tpl induced significant apoptosis in both the cell lines in a dose dependant manner but magnitude of apoptosis was significantly higher in mcf 7 than in t 47d cellstpl was also found to induce dose and time dependent increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species in both the cell linespresent results have demonstrated that mcf 7 and t 47 d cells exhibited differential sensitivity to tpl which seems to be dependant on their p53 statusinhibition of antiproliferative ability of tpl by antioxidants suggests a role for tpl induced ros in the induction of apoptosisit is concluded that p53 status of cancer cells formed an important factor in predicting the response of cancer cells to prooxidant drugs
