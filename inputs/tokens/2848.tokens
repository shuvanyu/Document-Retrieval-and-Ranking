background red yeast rice ryr is a widely available dietary supplement used by millions of patients as an alternative therapy for hyperlipidemiait contains 14 active compounds called monacolins that inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesisalthough studies have suggested that some formulations of ryr may be effective and safe for lipid lowering monacolin levels are not standardized among marketed products and are generally not published on labelswe evaluated monacolin levels in 12 commercial ryr formulations and tested for citrinin a mycotoxin that is nephrotoxic in animalsmethods each formulation of ryr was labeled 600 mgcapsule of active productanalyses for monacolins and citrinin were performed between august 2006 and june 2008 using highperformance liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopymass spectroscopy detectionlaboratory analyses of ryr products were conducted by consumerlabcom white plains new yorkresults there was marked variability in the 12 ryr products in total monacolins 0311115 mgcapsule monacolin k lovastatin 0101009 mgcapsule and monacolin ka 000230 mgcapsulefour products had elevated levels of citrininconclusions we found striking variability in monacolin content in 12 proprietary ryr products and the presence of citrinin in onethird of the formulations testedalthough ryr may have potential as an alternative lipidlowering agent our findings suggest the need for improved standardization of ryr products and product labelinguntil this occurs physicians should be cautious in recommending ryr to their patients for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease
