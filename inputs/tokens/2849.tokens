objective to determine the comparative effects of the thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone on myocardial infarction congestive heart failure and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetesdesign systematic review and metaanalysis of observational studiesdata sources searches of medline and embase in september 2010study selection observational studies that directly compared the risk of cardiovascular outcomes for rosiglitazone and pioglitazone among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were includeddata extraction random effects metaanalysis inverse variance method was used to calculate the odds ratios for cardiovascular outcomes with thiazolidinedione usethe i2 statistic was used to assess statistical heterogeneityresults cardiovascular outcomes from 16 observational studies 4 casecontrol studies and 12 retrospective cohort studies including 810 000 thiazolidinedione users were evaluated after a detailed review of 189 citationscompared with pioglitazone use of rosiglitazone was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of myocardial infarction n15 studies odds ratio 116 95 confidence interval 107 to 124 p0001 i246 congestive heart failure n8 122 114 to 131 p0001 i237 and death n8 114 109 to 120 p0001 i20numbers needed to treat to harm nnh depending on the population at risk suggest 170 excess myocardial infarctions 649 excess cases of heart failure and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazoneconclusion among patients with type 2 diabetes use of rosiglitazone is associated with significantly higher odds of congestive heart failure myocardial infarction and death relative to pioglitazone in real world settings
