reducing oxidative damage is thought to be an effective aging interventionaçai a fruit indigenous to the amazon is rich in phytochemicals that possesses high antioxidant activities and has antiinflammatory anticancer and anticardiovascular disease propertieshowever little is known about its potential antiaging properties especially at the organismal levelhere we evaluated the effect of açai pulp on modulating lifespan in drosophila melanogasterwe found that açai supplementation at 2 in the food increased the lifespan of female flies fed a high fat diet compared to the nonsupplemented controlwe measured transcript changes induced by açai for agerelated genesalthough transcript levels of most genes tested were not altered açai increased the transcript level of l2efl a small heatshockrelated protein and two detoxification genes gstd1 and mtna while decreasing the transcript level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pepck a key gene involved in gluconeogenesisfurthermore açai increased the lifespan of oxidative stressed females caused by sod1 rnaithis suggests that açai improves survival of flies fed a high fat diet through activation of stress response pathways and suppression of pepck expressionaçai has the potential to antagonize the detrimental effect of fat in the diet and alleviate oxidative stress in aging
