alzheimers disease ad is the most common dementing disorder of late lifealthough there might be various different triggering events in the early stages of the disease they seem to converge on a few characteristic final pathways in the late stages characterized by inflammation and neurodegenerationin this review we put forward the hypothesis that advanced glycation end products ages and their precursors including methylglyoxal are both biomarkers and causative agents gerontotoxins characteristic for this disorderaccumulation of ages is a normal feature of aging but is accelerated in ad where ages can be detected in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tanglesage modification may explain many of the neuropathological and biochemical features of ad such as extensive protein crosslinking inflammation oxidative stress and neuronal cell deathwe suggest that methylglyoxal is one of the major carbonyl species responsible for the formation of ageswe propose that one promising pharmacological approach to prevent the formation of ages would be to lower the methylglyoxal concentrationthis can be achieved for example by decreasing the concentration of methylglyoxal precursors such as dglyceraldehyde3phosphate by allowing a higher flux through the pentose phosphate pathway or by increasing methylglyoxal detoxification through the glyoxalase systemalternatively methylglyoxal could be scavenged by various types of carbonyl scavengerscopyright  2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
