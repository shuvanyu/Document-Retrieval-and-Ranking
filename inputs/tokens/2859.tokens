modern diets are largely heatprocessed and as a result contain high levels of advanced glycation end products agesdietary advanced glycation end products dages are known to contribute to increased oxidant stress and inflammation which are linked to the recent epidemics of diabetes and cardiovascular diseasethis report significantly expands the available dage database validates the dage testing methodology compares cooking procedures and inhibitory agents on new dage formation and introduces practical approaches for reducing dage consumption in daily lifebased on the findings dry heat promotes new dage formation by 10 to 100fold above the uncooked state across food categoriesanimalderived foods that are high in fat and protein are generally agerich and prone to new age formation during cookingin contrast carbohydraterich foods such as vegetables fruits whole grains and milk contain relatively few ages even after cookingthe formation of new dages during cooking was prevented by the age inhibitory compound aminoguanidine and significantly reduced by cooking with moist heat using shorter cooking times cooking at lower temperatures and by use of acidic ingredients such as lemon juice or vinegarthe new dage database provides a valuable instrument for estimating dage intake and for guiding food choices to reduce dage intake
