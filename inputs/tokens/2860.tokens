background abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa disease is an insidious condition with an 85 chance of death after ruptureultrasound screening can reduce mortality but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at riskmethods we used data from a retrospective cohort of 31 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of aaa by life line screening in 2003 to 2008risk factors associated with aaa were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysisresults we observed a positive association with increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessationexcess weight was associated with increased risk whereas exercise and consumption of nuts vegetables and fruits were associated with reduced riskblacks hispanics and asians had lower risk of aaa than whites and native americanswellknown risk factors were reaffirmed including male gender age family history and cardiovascular diseasea predictive scoring system was created that identifies aneurysms more efficiently than current criteria and includes women nonsmokers and individuals aged 65 yearsusing this model on national statistics of risk factors prevalence we estimated 11 million aaas in the united states of which 569000 are among women nonsmokers and individuals aged 65 yearsconclusions smoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle are associated with lower risk of aaawe estimated that about half of the patients with aaa disease are not eligible for screening under current guidelineswe have created a highyield screening algorithm that expands the target population for screening by including atrisk individuals not identified with existing screening criteria
