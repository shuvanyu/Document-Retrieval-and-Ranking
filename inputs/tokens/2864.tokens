objectives the study aimed to analyze the use of intensive lipidlowering therapy llt at discharge in a broad population of patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome acsbackground early and intensive statin therapy in acs was shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortalityutilization and predictors of llt among hospitalized acs patients are not knownmethods the gwtg database was analyzed for acsrelated hospitalizations from 2005 to 2009the use of llt defined as dose of statin or combination therapy likely to produce50 reductions in lowdensity lipoprotein ldl and less intensive llt at discharge was assessedbaseline characteristics and temporal trends in llt were compared in these 2 treatment groupsresults of 65396 patients receiving llt only 25036 383 were treated with an llt regimenmean total cholesterol ldl and triglycerides were significantly higher in the llt groupeven among those with ldl130 mgdl 50 or less received lltpredictors of llt at discharge included llt before admission hyperlipidemia prior coronary artery disease increasing body mass index and inhospital percutaneous coronary interventionalthough there was some temporal improvement in the rate of llt from 2005 to 2007 a decline in use of llt was noted in 2008 and 2009this was attributed to a sharp reduction in use of ezetimibe in combination with statin without corresponding increases in intensive statin monotherapyconclusions in a large cohort of patients admitted with acs most of the eligible patients were not discharged on lltthese data suggest the need for better implementation of guidelinerecommended intensive statin therapy in patients with acspublished by mosby inc
