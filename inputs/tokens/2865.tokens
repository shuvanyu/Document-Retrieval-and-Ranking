background the use of nasal irrigation for the treatment of nose and sinus complaints has its foundations in yogic and homeopathic traditionsthere has been increasing use of saline irrigation douches sprays and rinsing as an adjunct to the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitistreatment strategies often include the use of topical saline from once to more than four times a dayconsiderable patient effort is often involvedany additional benefit has been difficult to discern from other treatmentsobjectives to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical saline in the management of chronic rhinosinusitissearch strategy our search included the cochrane ear nose and throat disorders group trials register the cochrane central register of controlled trials central the cochrane library issue 4 2006 medline 1950 to 2006 and embase 1974 to 2006the date of the last search was november 2006selection criteria randomised controlled trials in which saline was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment a placebo as an adjunct to other treatments or against treatmentsthe comparison of hypertonic versus isotonic solutions was also compareddata collection and analysis trials were graded for methodological quality using the cochrane approach modification of chalmers 1990only symptom scores from saline versus no treatment and symptom and radiological scores from the hypertonic versus isotonic group could be pooled for statistical analysisa narrative overview of the remaining results is presentedmain results eight trials were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteriathree studies compared topical saline against no treatment one against placebo one as an adjunct to and one against an intranasal steroid spraytwo studies compared different hypertonic solutions against isotonic salinethere is evidence that saline is beneficial in the treatment of the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis when used as the sole modality of treatmentevidence also exists in favour of saline as a treatment adjunctno superiority was seen when saline was compared against a reflexology placebosaline is not as effective as an intranasal steroidsome evidence suggests that hypertonic solutions improve objective measures but the impact on symptoms is less clearauthors conclusions saline irrigations are well toleratedalthough minor side effects are common the beneficial effect of saline appears to outweigh these drawbacks for the majority of patientsthe use of topical saline could be included as a treatment adjunct for the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis
