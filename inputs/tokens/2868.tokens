many patients treated for vitamin d deficiency fail to achieve an adequate serum level of 25hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd despite high doses of ergo or cholecalciferolthe objective of this study was to determine whether administration of vitamin d supplement with the largest meal of the day would improve absorption and increase serum levels of 25ohd this was a prospective cohort study in an ambulatory tertiarycare referral centerpatients seen at the cleveland clinic foundation bone clinic for the treatment of vitamin d deficiency who were not responding to treatment make up the study groupsubjects were instructed to take their usual vitamin d supplement with the largest meal of the daythe main outcome measure was the serum 259ohd level after 2 to 3 monthsseventeen patients were analyzedthe mean age sd and sex fm ratio were 645  110 years and 13 females and 4 males respectivelythe dose of 25ohd ranged from 1000 to 50000 iu dailythe mean baseline serum 25ohd level sd was 305  47 ngml range 216 to 388 ngmlthe mean serum 25ohd level after diet modification sd was 472  109 ngml range 347 to 740 ngml p  01overall the average serum 25ohd level increased by 567  367a subgroup analysis based on the weekly dose of vitamin d was performed and a similar trend was observedthus it is concluded that taking vitamin d with the largest meal improves absorption and results in about a 50 increase in serum levels of 25ohd levels achievedsimilar increases were observed in a wide range of vitamin d doses taken for a variety of medical conditionscopyright 2010 american society for bone and mineral research
