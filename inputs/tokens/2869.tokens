background studies indicate that intake of vitamin d in the range from 1100 to 4000 iud and a serum 25hydroxyvitamin d concentration 25ohd from 6080 ngml may be needed to reduce cancer riskfew communitybased studies allow estimation of the doseresponse relationship between oral intake of vitamin d and corresponding serum 25ohd in the range above 1000 iudmaterials and methods a descriptive study of serum 25ohd concentration and selfreported vitamin d intake in a communitybased cohort n  3667 mean age 513  134 yresults serum 25ohd rose as a function of selfreported vitamin d supplement ingestion in a curvilinear fashion with no intakes of 10000 iud or lower producing 25ohd values above the lowerbound of the zone of potential toxicity 200 ngmlunsupplemented allsource input was estimated at 3300 iudthe supplemental dose ensuring that 975 of this population achieved a serum 25ohd of at least 40 ngml was 9600 iudconclusion universal intake of up to 40000 iu vitamin d per day is unlikely to result in vitamin d toxicity
