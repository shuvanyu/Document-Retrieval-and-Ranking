this randomized doubleblind parallel trial assessed the influence of pomegranate juice consumption on anterior and posterior carotid intimamedia thickness cimt progression rates in subjects at moderate risk for coronary heart diseasesubjects were men 45 to 74 years old and women 55 to 74 years old with  or 1 major coronary heart disease risk factor and baseline posterior wall cimt 07 to 20 mm without significant stenosisparticipants consumed 240 mlday of pomegranate juice n  146 or a control beverage n  143 for up to 18 monthsno significant difference in overall cimt progression rate was observed between pomegranate juice and control treatmentsin exploratory analyses in subjects in the most adverse tertiles for baseline serum lipid peroxides triglycerides tgs highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol tgshdl cholesterol total cholesterolhdl cholesterol and apolipoproteinb100 those in the pomegranate juice group had significantly less anterior wall andor composite cimt progression versus control subjectsin conclusion these results suggest that in subjects at moderate coronary heart disease risk pomegranate juice consumption had no significant effect on overall cimt progression rate but may have slowed cimt progression in subjects with increased oxidative stress and disturbances in the tgrich lipoproteinhdl axis
