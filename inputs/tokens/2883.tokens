increased oxidative stress contributes to the decline in cognitive performance during normal aging and in neurodegenerative conditions such as alzheimers diseasedietary supplementation with fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidant potential have in some cases compensated for oxidative stressherein we examined whether apple juice could alleviate the neurotoxic consequences of exposure of cultured neuronal cells to amyloidbeta abeta since at least a portion of the neurotoxicity of abeta is due to oxidative stressapple juice concentrate ajc 70 degree brix was diluted into culture medium of shsy5y human neuroblastoma cells that had been differentiated for 7 days with 5 microm retinoic acid concurrent with the addition of 20 microm abetaajc prevented the increased generation of reactive oxygen species ros normally induced by abeta treatment under these conditionsajc also prevented abetainduced calcium influx and apoptosis each of which results in part due to increased rosthese findings suggest that the antioxidant potential of apple products can prevent abetainduced oxidative damage
