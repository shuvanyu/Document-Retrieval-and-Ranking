aims the objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa contamination of retail meat and to determine the level of contaminationmethods and results pork pork chops and ground pork ground beef and chicken legs wings and thighs were purchased at retail outlets in four canadian provinces and tested for the presence of methicillinresistant staphaureus using qualitative and quantitative methodsmrsa was isolated from 96 of pork 56 of beef and 12 of chicken samples p  00002low levels of mrsa were typically present with 37 below the detection threshold for quantification and 100 cfu g1 present in most quantifiable samplesall isolates were classified as canadian epidemic mrsa2 cmrsa2 by pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge with two different pfge subtypes and were spa type 24t242conclusions mrsa contamination of retail meat is not uncommonwhile cmrsa2 a human epidemic clone has been found in pigs in canada the lack of isolation of livestockassociated st398 was surprisingsignificance and impact of the study the relevance of mrsa contamination of meat is unclear but investigation is required because of the potential for exposure from food handlingsources of contamination require investigation because these results suggest that human or animal sources could be involved
