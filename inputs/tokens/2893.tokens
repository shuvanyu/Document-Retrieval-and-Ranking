background the us diet is high in salt with the majority coming from processed foodsreducing dietary salt is an important potential public health targetmethods we used the coronary heart disease chd policy model to quantify the benefits of potentially achievable populationwide reductions in dietary salt of up to 3 gmday 1200 mgday of sodiumwe estimated cardiovascular disease rates and costs in age sex and race subgroups compared salt reduction with other interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk and determined the costeffectiveness of salt reduction compared with drug treatment of hypertensionresults reducing salt by 3 gmday is projected to result in 60000120000 fewer new chd cases 3200066000 fewer new strokes 5400099000 fewer myocardial infarctions and 4400092000 fewer deaths from any cause annuallyall segments of the population would benefit with blacks benefiting proportionately more women benefiting particularly from stroke reduction older adults from reductions in chd events and younger adults from lower mortality ratesthe cardiovascular benefits from lower salt are on par with benefits from reducing tobacco obesity or cholesterola regulatory intervention designed to achieve 3 gmday salt reduction would save 194000392000 qualityadjusted lifeyears and 1024 billion in healthcare costs annuallysuch an intervention would be costsaving even if only a modest 1 gmday reduction were achieved gradually over the decade from 20102019 and would be more costeffective than treating all hypertensive individuals with medicationsconclusions modest reduction in dietary salt could substantially reduce cardiovascular events and medical costs and should be a public health target
