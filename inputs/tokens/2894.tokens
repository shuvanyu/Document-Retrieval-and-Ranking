we determined the genotoxicity of 39 chemicals currently in use as food additivesthey fell into six categoriesdyes color fixatives and preservatives preservatives antioxidants fungicides and sweetenerswe tested groups of four male ddy mice once orally with each additive at up to 05xld50 or the limit dose 2000mgkg and performed the comet assay on the glandular stomach colon liver kidney urinary bladder lung brain and bone marrow 3 and 24h after treatmentof all the additives dyes were the most genotoxicamaranth allura red new coccine tartrazine erythrosine phloxine and rose bengal induced doserelated dna damage in the glandular stomach colon andor urinary bladderall seven dyes induced dna damage in the gastrointestinal organs at a low dose 10 or 100mgkgamong them amaranth allura red new coccine and tartrazine induced dna damage in the colon at close to the acceptable daily intakes adistwo antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole bha and butylated hydroxytoluene bht three fungicides biphenyl sodium ophenylphenol and thiabendazole and four sweeteners sodium cyclamate saccharin sodium saccharin and sucralose also induced dna damage in gastrointestinal organsbased on these results we believe that more extensive assessment of food additives in current use is warranted
