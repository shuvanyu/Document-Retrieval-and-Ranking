sorbic acid sodium sorbate and potassium sorbate were tested for their genotoxic potential in the syrian hamster embryo she fibroblast micronucleus assay and the she cell transformation test in vitrosorbic acid and potassium sorbate showed no activity in either test systemwhen freshly prepared sodium sorbate solutions were used no genotoxic or celltransforming activity was detectedhowever sodium sorbate as stored solution which previously had been heated and sonicated to facilitate solubilization yielded a positive response in both test systemsit is concluded that oxidation products of sodium sorbate that possess genotoxic and celltransforming properties are formed under conditions of heating sonication and storage
