the present study evaluates the genotoxic potential of potassium sorbate ps in cultured and isolated human lymphocytesto assess the damage caused by ps in humans we designed in vitro experiments by measuring chromosomal aberrations cas sisterchromatid exchanges sces micronucleus mn and comet assayslymphocytes were treated with negative control sterile distilled water positive control mmc for cultured lymphocytes and h2o2 for isolated lymphocytes and four concentrations 125 250 500 and 1000 microgml of psaccording to the results ps treatment significantly increases the cas with or without gaps at 500 and 1000 microgml concentrations and sces at 250 500 1000 microgml for 24h and 125 250 500 1000 microgml for 48h compared with vehicle controlfollowing treatment of the isolated lymphocytes for 1h significant psinduced dna strand breaks were observed at all concentrationshowever ps failed to significantly affect the mn assayon the contrary ps does not cause cell cycle delay as noted by the nonsignificant decrease in the cytokinesisblock proliferation index cbpi and replicative index rionly a slight decrease was observed in the mitotic index mi at the highest concentration for both treatment timesfrom the results ps is clearly seen to be genotoxic to the human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitrocopyright c 2009 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
