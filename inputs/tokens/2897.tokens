the ability of sorbic acid and its potassium and sodium salts to induce chromosome aberrations sister chromatid exchanges sce and gene mutations in cultured chinese hamster v79 cells was examinedsodium sorbate caused significant induction of chromosome aberrations and sce and also induced 6thioguanineresistant mutations in a dosedependent mannerthe clastogenic potency of sodium sorbate was found to be less than one hundredth of that of the potent clastogen nmethylnnitronnitrosoguanidinethe induction of sce by sodium sorbate was twice the control level whereas that by methyl methanesulphonate a potent inducer of sce was 14 times the control levelthe mutagenic potency of sodium sorbate was less than onetenth that of ethyl methanesulphonate a potent inducer of mutation when compared at an equitoxic levelsorbic acid and its potassium salt induced chromosome aberrations but only at the highest doses testedthese compounds also induced 12 times the control level of sce but neither compound induced 6thioguanineresistant mutationsthe cytogenetic activity of sodium sorbate was concluded not to be due to the effect of osmotic pressure or an impuritythese results indicate that sodium sorbate is a genotoxic agent although its potency seems to be weak and that sorbic acid and potassium sorbate are less genotoxic than the sodium salt
