the effects of drinking sodiumbicarbonated mineral water on cardiovascular risk in young men and women with moderate cardiovascular risk were studiedeighteen young volunteers total cholesterol levels 52 mmoll without any disease participatedthe study consisted of two 8week intervention periodssubjects consumed as supplement to their usual diet 1 lday control low mineral water followed by 1 lday bicarbonated mineral water 48 mmoll sodium 35 mmoll bicarbonate and 17 mmoll chloridedeterminations were performed at the end of the control water period and on weeks 4 and 8 of the bicarbonated water periodbody weight body mass index bmi blood pressure dietary intake total cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol apolipoprotein apo ai apo b triacylgycerols glucose insulin adiponectin highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp soluble adhesion molecules soluble intercellular adhesion molecule sicam and soluble vascular adhesion molecule svcam sodium and chloride urinary excretion and urine ph were measureddietary intake body weight and bmi showed no significant variationssystolic blood pressure decreased significantly after 4 weeks of bicarbonated water consumption without significant differences between weeks 4 and 8after bicarbonated water consumption significant reductions in total cholesterol by 63 p012 ldl cholesterol by 10 p001 totalhdl cholesterol p004 ldlhdl cholesterol p001 and apo b p017 were observedserum triacylglycerol apo ai sicam1 svcam1 and hscrp levels did not changeserum glucose values tended to decrease during the bicarbonated water intervention p056 but insulin levels did not varythis sodiumbicarbonated mineral water improves lipid profile in moderately hypercholesterolemic young men and women and could therefore be applied in dietary interventions to reduce cardiovascular riskcopyright  2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
