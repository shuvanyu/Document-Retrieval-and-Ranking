lignans are a class of secondary plant metabolites produced by oxidative dimerization of two phenylpropanoid unitsalthough their molecular backbone consists only of two phenylpropane c6c3 units lignans show an enormous structural diversitythere is a growing interest in lignans and their synthetic derivatives due to applications in cancer chemotherapy and various other pharmacological effectsthis review deals with lignans possessing anticancer antioxidant antimicrobial antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activities and comprises the data reported in more than 100 peerreviewed articles so as to highlight the recently reported bioactive lignans that could be a first step towards the development of potential new therapeutic agents
