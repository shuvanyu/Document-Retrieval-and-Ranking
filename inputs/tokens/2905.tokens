persea americana is much sought after both for the nutritional value of its fruit and the medicinal values of its various plant partsa chromosomal aberration assay was undertaken to evaluate the potential genotoxicity of crude extracts from avocado fruits and leaveschromosomal aberrations were observed in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes exposed to separately increasing concentrations of 50 methanolic extracts of persea americana fruit and leavesthe groups exposed to leaf and fruit extracts respectively showed a concentrationdependent increase in chromosomal aberrations as compared to that in a control groupthe mean percentage total aberrant metaphases at 100 mgkg 200 mgkg and 300 mgkg concentrations of leaf extract were found respectively to be 58  705 72  641 and 78  598 which were significantly higher p  00001 each than that in the control group 6  339the mean percentage total aberrant metaphases at 100 mgkg 200 mgkg and 300 mgkg concentrations of fruit extract were found to be 18  549 40  1000 and 52  1020 respectively which were significantly higher p  0033 p  00001 and p  00001 respectively than that for control 6  339acrocentric associations and premature centromeric separation were the two most common abnormalities observed in both the exposed groupsthe group exposed to leaf extracts also showed a significant number of a variety of other structural aberrations including breaks fragments dicentrics terminal deletion minutes and robertsonian translocationsthe group exposed to leaf extract showed higher frequency of all types of aberrations at equal concentrations as compared to the group exposed to fruit extract
