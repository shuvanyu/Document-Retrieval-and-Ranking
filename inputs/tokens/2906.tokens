avocados have a high content of phytochemicals with potential chemopreventive activitypreviously we reported that phytochemicals extracted from avocado meat into a chloroform partition d003 selectively induced apoptosis in cancer but not normal human oral epithelial cell linesin the present study we observed that treatment of human oral cancer cell lines containing high levels of reactive oxygen ros with d003 increased ros levels twofold to threefold and induced apoptosisin contrast ros levels increased only 13fold and apoptosis was not induced in the normal cell lines containing much lower levels of basal roswhen cellular ros levels in the malignant cell lines were reduced by nacetyllcysteine nac cells were resistant to d003 induced apoptosisnac also delayed the induction of apoptosis in dominant negative faddexpressing malignant cell linesd003 increased ros levels via mitochondrial complex i in the electron transport chain to induce apoptosisnormal human oral epithelial cell lines transformed with hpv16 e6 or e7 expressed higher basal levels of ros and became sensitive to d003these data suggest that perturbing the ros levels in human oral cancer cell lines may be a key factor in selective apoptosis and molecular targeting for chemoprevention by phytochemicals
