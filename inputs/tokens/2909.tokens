we developed a probabilistic model to characterize the plausible distribution of health and economic benefits that would accrue to the us population following reduction of methyl mercury mehg exposuremehg a known human developmental neurotoxicant may increase fatal heart attack risksmodel parameters reflect current understanding of the relationships between mehg intake health risks and societal valuation of these risksthe expected monetary value of the annual health benefits generated by a 10 reduction in us population exposure to mehg for one year is 860 million 80 of this is associated with reductions in fatal heart attacks and the remainder with iq gainsthe plausible distribution of the benefits is quite broad with 5th and 95th percentile estimates of approximately 50 million and 35 billion respectivelythe largest source of uncertainty is whether epidemiological associations between mehg exposure and fatal heart attacks reflect causalitythe next largest sources of uncertainty concern the slope of the relationship between maternal mehg exposure and reduced intelligence among children and whether this relationship exhibits a thresholdour analysis suggests that the possible causal relationship between mehg exposure and fatal heart attacks should be better characterized using additional epidemiological studies and formally elicited expert judgment
