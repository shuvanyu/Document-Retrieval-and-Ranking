the emerging role of chronic inflammation in the major degenerative diseases of modern society has stimulated research into the influence of nutrition and dietary patterns on inflammatory indicesmost human studies have correlated analyses of habitual dietary intake as determined by a food frequency questionnaire or 24hour recall with systemic markers of inflammation like highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp interleukin6 il6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfαan occasional study also includes nutrition analysis of blood componentsthere have been several controlled interventions which evaluated the effect of a change in dietary pattern or of single foods on inflammatory markers in defined populationsmost studies reveal a modest effect of dietary composition on some inflammatory markers in freeliving adults although different markers do not vary in unisonsignificant dietary influences have been established for glycemic index gi and load gl fiber fatty acid composition magnesium carotenoids and flavonoidsa traditional mediterranean dietary pattern which typically has a high ratio of monounsaturated mufa to saturated sfa fats and ω3 to ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas and supplies an abundance of fruits vegetables legumes and grains has shown antiinflammatory effects when compared with typical north american and northern european dietary patterns in most observational and interventional studies and may become the diet of choice for diminishing chronic inflammation in clinical practice
