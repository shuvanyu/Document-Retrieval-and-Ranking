background  aims dietary arachidonic acid an n6 polyunsaturated fatty acid n6 pufa might be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis ucwe performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether high levels of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue samples which reflects dietary intake are associated with ucmethods we analyzed data collected from 57053 men and women in the epicdenmark prospective cohort study from 1993 to 1997adipose tissue biopsy samples were collected from gluteal regions at the beginning of the study the cohort was monitored over subsequent years and participants who developed uc were identifieda subcohort of 2510 randomly selected participants were used as controlsconcentrations of arachidonic acid were measured in adipose tissue samplesin the analysis arachidonic acid levels were divided into quartiles relative risks rr were calculated and adjusted for smoking use of aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and levels of n3 pufasresults a total of 34 subjects 56 men developed incident uc at a median age of 588 years range 500690 yearsthose in the highest quartile for arachidonic acid concentrations in adipose tissue had an rr for uc of 416 95 confidence interval ci 1561104 a trend per 01 increase in arachidonic acid of 177 in rr was observed 95 ci 138227the fraction attributed the highest levels of arachidonic acid was 403conclusions individuals with the highest relative concentrations of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue have a significantly greater risk of developing ucdietary modifications might therefore prevent uc or reduce disease symptomscopyright  2010 aga institutepublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
