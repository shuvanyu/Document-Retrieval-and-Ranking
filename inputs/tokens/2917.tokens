vegetarians have an apparent diminished risk for the development of ischemic coronary heart diseasethis may be secondary to dietary effects of plasma lipids and lipoproteins but platelets which may also play a role have also been observed to have aberrant functions in vegetarianswe measured plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels platelet function platelet fatty acid levels and platelet active prostaglandins in ten strict vegetarians vegans 15 lactovegetarians and 25 age and sexmatched omnivorous controlsthe most striking observations were a highly significant rise in platelet linoleic acid concentration and a decline in platelet arachidonic acid concentration in both vegetarian subgroups as compared with omnivorous controlsserum thromboxane and prostacyclin levels as well as results of platelet aggregation studies did not differ among the groups testedcholesterol levels were significantly lower in both vegetarian groups as compared with controls but plasma high and lowdensity lipoprotein levels were lower only in the vegan subgroup as compared with omnivoresif diet produces these changes in platelet fatty acid and plasma lipid levels it may contribute to the decreased risk of coronary heart disease and possibly atherosclerosis in vegetarians
