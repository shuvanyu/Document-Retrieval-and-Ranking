background the physical health status of vegetarians has been extensively reported but there is limited research regarding the mental health status of vegetarians particularly with regard to moodvegetarian diets exclude fish the major dietary source of eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha critical regulators of brain cell structure and functionomnivorous diets low in epa and dha are linked to impaired mood states in observational and experimental studiesmethods we examined associations between mood state and polyunsaturated fatty acid intake as a result of adherence to a vegetarian or omnivorous diet in a crosssectional study of 138 healthy seventh day adventist men and women residing in the southwestparticipants completed a quantitative food frequency questionnaire depression anxiety stress scale dass and profile of mood states poms questionnairesresults vegetarians vegn  60 reported significantly less negative emotion than omnivores omnn  78 as measured by both mean total dass and poms scores 832  088 vs 1751  188 p  000 and 010  199 vs 1533  310 p  007 respectivelyveg reported significantly lower mean intakes of epa p  001 dha p  001 as well as the omega6 fatty acid arachidonic acid aa p  001 and reported higher mean intakes of shorterchain Î±linolenic acid p  001 and linoleic acid p  001 than omnmean total dass and poms scores were positively related to mean intakes of epa p  005 dha p  005 and aa p  005 and inversely related to intakes of ala p  005 and la p  005 indicating that participants with low intakes of epa dha and aa and high intakes of ala and la had better moodconclusions the vegetarian diet profile does not appear to adversely affect mood despite low intake of longchain omega3 fatty acids
