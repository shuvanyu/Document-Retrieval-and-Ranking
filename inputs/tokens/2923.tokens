low fecal weight and slow bowel transit time are thought to be associated with bowel cancer risk but few published data defining bowel habits in different communities existtherefore data on stool weight were collected from 20 populations in 12 countries to define this risk more accurately and the relationship between stool weight and dietary intake of nonstarch polysaccharides nsp dietary fiber was quantifiedin 220 healthy uk adults undertaking careful fecal collections median daily stool weight was 106 gday men 104 gday women 99 gday p  002 and wholegut transit time was 60 hours men 55 hours women 72 hours p  005 17 of women but only 1 of men passed  50 g stooldaydata from other populations of the world show average stool weight to vary from 72 to 470 gday and to be inversely related to colon cancer risk r  078metaanalysis of 11 studies in which daily fecal weight was measured accurately in 26 groups of people n  206 on controlled diets of known nsp content shows a significant correlation between fiber intake and mean daily stool weight r  084stool weight in many westernized populations is low 80120 gday and this is associated with increased colon cancer riskfecal output is increased by dietary nspdiets characterized by high nsp intake approximately 18 gday are associated with stool weights of 150 gday and should reduce the risk of bowel cancer
