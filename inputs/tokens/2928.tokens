we studied 10 vegetarian and 10 nonvegetarian premenopausal women on four occasions approximately four months apartduring each study period the participants kept threeday dietary records and estrogens were measured in plasma urinary and fecal samplesvegetarians consumed less total fat than omnivores did 30 per cent of total calories as compared with 40 per cent and more dietary fiber 28 g per day as compared with 12 gthere was a positive correlation between fecal weight and fecal excretion of estrogens in both groups p less than 0001 with vegetarians having higher fecal weight and increased fecal excretion of estrogensurinary excretion of estriol was lower in vegetarians p less than 005 and their plasma levels of estrone and estradiol were negatively correlated with fecal excretion of estrogen p  0005among the vegetarians the betaglucuronidase activity of fecal bacteria was significantly reduced p  005we conclude that vegetarian women have an increased fecal output which leads to increased fecal excretion of estrogen and a decreased plasma concentration of estrogen
