background several publications reported breast cancer incidence rates continued to decrease among white women following the decline of about 7 from 2002 to 2003however none of these reports exclusively examined the trend after 2003in this paper we examined breast cancer incidence rates among nonhispanic nh white women from 2003 to 2007 to determine whether the decrease in breast cancer incidence rates indeed persisted through 2007in addition we present breast cancer incidence trends for nh black and hispanic women and postmenopausal hormone use for all three racialethnic groupsmethods breast cancer incidence rates were calculated by raceethnicity age and er status using data from the surveillance epidemiology and end results seer 12 registries for 2000 to 2007prevalence of postmenopausal hormone use was calculated using national health interview survey data from 2000 2005 and 2008results from 2003 to 2007 overall breast cancer incidence rates did not change significantly among nh white women in any age grouphowever rates increased 27 per year for er breast cancers in ages 40 to 49 and decreased for er breast cancers in ages 40 to 49 and 60 to 69similarly overall breast cancer incidence rates did not change significantly for black and hispanic womenhormone use continued to decrease from 2005 to 2008 in all groups although the decreases were smaller compared to those from 2000 to 2005conclusions the sharp decline in breast cancer incidence rates that occurred from 2002 to 2003 among nh white women did not continue through 2007impact further studies are needed to better understand the recent breast cancer trends2011 aacr
