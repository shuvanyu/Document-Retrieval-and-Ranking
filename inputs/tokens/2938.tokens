background very few studies have examined the association between attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder adhd and phthalate exposure in humansthe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of phthalates on symptoms of adhd in schoolage childrenmethods a crosssectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed and scores on measures of adhd symptoms and neuropsychological dysfunction with regard to attention and impulsivity were obtained from 261 korean children age 811 yearsresults mono2ethylheyl phthalate mehp and mono2ethyl5oxohexylphthalate meop for metabolites of di2ethylhexylphthalate dehp and mononbutyl phthalate mnbp for metabolites of dibutyl phthalate dbp were measured in urine samplesthe mean concentrations of mehp meop and mnbp were 340 microgdl sd  363 range 213867 234 microgdl sd  230 range 752448 and 467 microgl sd  214 range 1321593 respectivelyafter adjustment for covariates teacherrated adhd scores were significantly associated with dehp metabolites but not with dbp metaboliteswe also found significant relationships between the urine concentrations of metabolites for dbp and the number of omission and commission errors in continuous performance tests cpt after adjustment for covariatesconclusion the present study showed a strong positive association between phthalate metabolites in urine and symptoms of adhd among schoolage children
