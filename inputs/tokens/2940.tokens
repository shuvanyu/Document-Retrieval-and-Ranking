skin functions and structure are significantly influenced by nutrientsantioxidants protect the supportive layer of the skin against any damaging irradiation effects and the action of free radicalsa lack of suitable methods means that the pharmacokinetic properties of systemically applied carotenoids transferred into the skin remain poorly understoodin this study a natural kale extract or placebo oil were given orally to 22 healthy volunteers for 4 weekscarotenoid bioaccessibility was evaluated using noninvasive resonance raman spectroscopy on the palm and forehead skinfor the analysis of the blood serum the standard hplc method was usedthe blood and skin levels of the carotenoids increased significantly during the study but compared to the blood serum values increases in skin were delayed and depended on the dermal area as well as on the carotenoidlycopene measured as being low in the extract increases more in the skin compared to the blood indicating that the natural mixture of the extract stabilizes the antioxidative network in the skinafter supplementation had ended the carotenoids decreased much faster in the blood than in the skinthe delayed decrease in the skin may indicate a peripheral buffer function of the skin for carotenoidscopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
