to clarify the role of the faecal flora in the dietinduced decrease of rheumatoid arthritis ra activity 43 ra patients were randomized into two groups the test group to receive living food a form of uncooked vegan diet rich in lactobacilli and the control group to continue their ordinary omnivorous dietsbased on clinical assessments before during and after the intervention period a disease improvement index was constructed for each patientaccording to the index patients were assigned either to a group with a high improvement index hi or to a group with a low improvement index lostool samples collected from each patient before the intervention and at 1 month were analysed by direct stool sample gasliquid chromatography of bacterial cellular fatty acidsthis method has proved to be a simple and sensitive way to detect changes and differences in the faecal microbial flora between individual stool samples or groups of thema significant dietinduced change in the faecal flora p  0001 was observed in the test group but not in the control groupfurther in the test group a significant p  0001 difference was detected between the hi and lo categories at 1 month but not in the pretest sampleswe conclude that a vegan diet changes the faecal microbial flora in ra patients and changes in the faecal flora are associated with improvement in ra activity
