excessive milk consumption has a long association with increased respiratory tract mucus production and asthmasuch an association cannot be explained using a conventional allergic paradigm and there is limited medical evidence showing causalityin the human colon betacasomorphin7 betacm7 an exorphin derived from the breakdown of a1 milk stimulates mucus production from gut muc5ac glandsin the presence of inflammation similar mucus overproduction from respiratory tract muc5ac glands characterises many respiratory tract diseasesbetacm7 from the blood stream could stimulate the production and secretion of mucus production from these respiratory glandssuch a hypothesis could be tested in vitro using quantitative rtpcr to show that the addition of betacm7 into an incubation medium of respiratory goblet cells elicits an increase in muc5ac mrna and by identifying betacm7 in the blood of asthmatic patientsthis association may not necessarily be simply cause and effect as the person has to be consuming a1 milk betacm7 must pass into the systemic circulation and the tissues have to be actively inflamedthese prerequisites could explain why only a subgroup of the population who have increased respiratory tract mucus production find that many of their symptoms including asthma improve on a dairy elimination dietc 2009 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
