calcium loss after menopause increases the risk of osteoporosis in aging womensoymilk is often consumed to reduce menopausal symptoms although in its native form it contains significantly less calcium than cows milkmoreover when calcium is added as a fortificant it may not be absorbed efficientlythis study compares calcium absorption from soymilk fortified with a proprietary phosphate of calcium versus absorption from cows milkpreliminary studies compared methods for labelling the calcium fortificant either before or after its addition to soymilkit was established that fortificant labelled after it was added to soymilk had a tracer distribution pattern very similar to that shown by fortificant labelled before adding to soymilk provided a heat treatment 90c for 30 min was appliedthis method was therefore used for further bioavailability studiescalcium absorption from fortified soy milk compared to cows milk was examined using a randomised singleblind acute crossover design study in 12 osteopenic postmenopausal women aged mean  sd 56753 years with a body mass index of 26556 kgm2participants consumed 20 ml of test milk labelled after addition of fortificant with 185 kbq of 45ca in 44 mg of calcium carrier allowing the determination of the hourly fractional calcium absorption rate alpha using a single isotope radiocalcium testthe mean hourly fractional calcium absorption from fortified soymilk was found to be comparable to that of cows milk alpha  065019 and alpha 066022 p005 respectively
