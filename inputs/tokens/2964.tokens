there is ample reason to believe that diets rich in phytochemicals provide protection from vascular diseases and many cancers direct antioxidant activity as well as modulation of enzyme expression or hormone activity contribute to this effectphytochemicals derived from diverse foods presumably can interact additively and possibly synergistically thus the total dietary load of phytochemicals may have important implications for healthas a means of very roughly quantifying this load a phytochemical index pi is proposed defined as the percent of dietary calories derived from foods rich in phytochemicalscalories derived from fruits vegetables excluding potatoes legumes whole grains nuts seeds fruitvegetable juices soy products wine beer and cider  and foods compounded therefrom  would be counted in this indexpartial credit could be given for antioxidantrich extra virgin olive oilother added oils refined sugars refined grains potato products hard liquors and animal products  regrettably the chief sources of calories in typical western diets  would be excludedalthough the pi would provide only a very rough approximation of the quantity or quality of phytochemical nutrition it nonetheless could aid epidemiologists in exploring the health consequences of diets high in phytochemicalrich plant foods and could also help clinical nutritionists in their efforts to improve the phytochemical nutrition of their clients
