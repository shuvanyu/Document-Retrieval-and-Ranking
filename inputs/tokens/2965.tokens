vegetarian diets are rich in antioxidant phytochemicalshowever they may not act as antioxidants in vivo and yet still have important signaling and regulatory functionssome may act as prooxidants modulating cellular redox tone and oxidizing redox sensitive sitesin this review evidence for health benefits of vegetarian diets is presented from different perspectives epidemiological biomarker evolutionary and public health as well as antioxidantfrom the perspective of molecular connections between diet and health evidence of a role for plasma ascorbic acid as a biomarker for future disease risk is presentedbasic concepts of redoxbased cell signaling are presented and effects of antioxidant phytochemicals on signaling especially via redox tone sulfur switches and the antioxidant response element are are exploredsufficient scientific evidence exists for public health policy to promote a plantrich diet for health promotionthis does not need to wait for science to provide all the answers as to why and howhowever action and interplay of dietary antioxidants in the nonequilibrium systems that control redox balance cell signaling and cell function provide rich ground for research to advance understanding of orthomolecular nutrition and provide sciencebased evidence to advance public health in our aging population
