physiological and pharmacological blood concentrations of melatonin inhibit tumorigenesis in a variety of in vivo and in vitro experimental models of neoplasiaevidence indicates that melatonins anticancer effects are exerted via inhibition of cell proliferation and a stimulation of differentiation and apoptosisa new mechanism by which physiological and pharmacological blood levels of melatonin inhibit cancer growth in vivois via a melatonininduced suppression of tumor linoleic acid la uptake and its metabolism to the important mitogenic signaling molecule 13hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid 13hodemelatonin suppresses camp formation and inhibits tumor uptake of la and its metabolism to 13hode via a melatonin receptormediated mechanism in both tissueisolated rat hepatoma 7288 ctc and human breast cancer xenograftsit has been postulated that in industrialized societies light at night by suppressing melatonin production poses a new risk for the development of breast cancer and perhaps other cancers as wellin support of this hypothesis light during darkness suppresses nocturnal melatonin production and stimulates the la metabolism and growth of rat hepatoma and human breast cancer xenograftsnocturnal dietary supplementation with melatonin at levels contained in a melatoninrich diet inhibits rat hepatoma growth via the mechanisms described abovethe nocturnal melatonin signal organizes tumor metabolism and growth within circadian time structure that can be further reinforced by appropriately timed melatonin supplementationdietary melatonin supplementation working in concert with the endogenous melatonin signal has the potential to be a new preventivetherapeutic strategy to optimize the hostcancer balance in favor of host survival and quality of life
