recent studies of shiftworking women have reported that excessive exposure to light at night lan may be a risk factor for breast cancerhowever no studies have yet attempted to examine the codistribution of lan and breast cancer incidence on a population level with the goal to assess the coherence of these earlier findings with population trendscoherence is one of hills criteria actually viewpoints for an inference of causalitynighttime satellite images were used to estimate lan levels in 147 communities in israelmultiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between lan and breast cancer incidence rates and as a test of the specificity of our method lung cancer incidence rates in women across localities under the prediction of a link with breast cancer but not lung cancerafter adjusting for several variables available on a population level such as ethnic makeup birth rate population density and local income level a strong positive association between lan intensity and breast cancer rate was revealed p005 and this association strengthened p001 when only statistically significant factors were filtered out by stepwise regression analysisconcurrently no association was found between lan intensity and lung cancer ratethese results provide coherence of the previously reported casecontrol and cohort studies with the codistribution of lan and breast cancer on a population basisthe analysis yielded an estimated 73 higher breast cancer incidence in the highest lan exposed communities compared to the lowest lan exposed communities
