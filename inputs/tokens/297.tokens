background the purpose of this article is to evaluate the impact of low protein and high fiber intakes on risk factors of stone recurrence in idiopathic calcium stone formers icsfsmethods ninetysix icsfs were randomly assigned a low animal protein diet  10 of total energy a highfiber diet  25 gday or a usual diet control group all patients were recommended to increase their fluid intaketheir daily urine compositions were analyzed at baseline and at four monthscompliance with dietary recommendations was checked by validated food frequency questionnairescompliance with total and animal protein intakes was assessed by 24hour urea and sulfate outputs respectivelythe nutritional intervention oral instructions written leaflet phoning and food assessment were carried out by a research dietitianresults at baseline diets and the daily urine composition did not differ between the three groupsat four months while diets differed significantly the 24hour output of calcium and oxalate did not differ significantly within and between groups after adjustment for potential confounders age sex and personal and family history of calcium stones and baseline valueshowever as many as 12 out of 31 icsfs 95 ci 22 to 58 assigned to a low animal protein diet achieved a reduction in the urine urea excretion rate of more than 50 mmolday and also exhibited a significant decrease in urinary calcium excretion that averaged 18 mmoldaya significant correlation between urea and calcium outputs was observed only among patients with hypercalciuriaconclusions these results show that only icsfs who markedly decrease their animal protein intake especially those with hypercalciuria can expect to benefit from dietary recommendations
