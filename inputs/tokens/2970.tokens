background breast cancer incidence is increasing globally for largely unknown reasonsthe possibility that a portion of the breast cancer burden might be explained by the introduction and increasing use of electricity to light the night was suggested 20 years agomethods the theory is based on nocturnal lightinduced disruption of circadian rhythms notably reduction of melatonin synthesisit has formed the basis for a series of predictions including that nonday shift work would increase risk blind women would be at lower risk long sleep duration would lower risk and community nighttime light level would codistribute with breast cancer incidence on the population levelresults accumulation of epidemiological evidence has accelerated in recent years reflected in an international agency for research on cancer iarc classification of shift work as a probable human carcinogen 2athere is also a strong rodent model in support of the lightatnight lan ideaconclusion if a consensus eventually emerges that lan does increase risk then the mechanisms for the effect are important to elucidate for intervention and mitigationthe basic understanding of phototransduction for the circadian system and of the molecular genetics of circadian rhythm generation are both advancing rapidly and will provide for the development of lighting technologies at home and at work that minimize circadian disruption while maintaining visual efficiency and aestheticsin the interim there are strategies now available to reduce the potential for circadian disruption which include extending the daily dark period appreciate nocturnal awakening in the dark using dim red light for nighttime necessities and unless recommended by a physician not taking melatonin tablets
