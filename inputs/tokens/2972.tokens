night is no longer dark in the modern world and the milky way has disappearedelectric light has benefits but there are also a few detrimentsthese are 1 loss of the night sky 2 wasted energy 3 harm to animal and plant life 4 and perhaps increases in some severe human maladies such as cancers of breast and prostatethe science on phototransduction for the circadian system and on clock gene function is evolving rapidly and it provides a rationale for the idea that circadian disruption from light at night could cause diseasedirect evidence from humans and rodent models has also accumulated to the point where the idea is no longer fancifulalthough it may seem logical now the journey on the path from electric light to breast cancer has been a tortuous one at least for me
