several epidemiologic studies have shown that chronic inflammation predisposes individuals to various types of cancermany cancers arise from sites of infection chronic irritation and inflammationconversely an oncogenic change induces an inflammatory microenvironment that promotes the development of tumorsnatural bioactive compounds in dietary plant products including fruits vegetables grains legumes tea and wine are claimed to help prevent cancer degenerative diseases and chronic and acute inflammationmodern methods in cell and molecular biology allow us to understand the interactions of different natural bioactive compounds with basic mechanisms of inflammatory responsethe molecular pathways of this cancerrelated inflammation are now unravelednatural bioactive compounds exert antiinflammatory activity by modulating proinflammatory gene expressions have shown promising chemopreventive activitythis review summarizes current knowledge on natural bioactive compounds that act through the signaling pathways and modulate inflammatory gene expressions thus providing evidence for these substances in cancer chemopreventive action
