background vinegar reduces postprandial glycemia ppg in healthy adultsthis study investigated the vinegar dosage 10 vs 20 g timing during mealtime vs 5 h before meal and application acetic acid as vinegar vs neutralized salt for reducing ppgmethods four randomized crossover trials were conducted in adults n  910trial with type 2 diabetes 1 trial or without diabetes 3 trialsall trials followed the same protocol a standardized meal the evening prior to testing an overnight fast  1 10 h and 2hour glucose testing following consumption of a bagel and juice test meal 3 trials or dextrose solution 1 trialfor each trial ppg was compared between treatments using areaunderthecurve calculations 120 min after the mealresults two teaspoons of vinegar  10 g effectively reduced ppg and this effect was most pronounced when vinegar was ingested during mealtime as compared to 5 h before the mealvinegar did not alter ppg when ingested with monosaccharides suggesting that the antiglycemic action of vinegar is related to the digestion of carbohydratesfinally sodium acetate did not alter ppg indicating that acetate salts lack antiglycemic propertiesconclusions the antiglycemic properties of vinegar are evident when small amounts of vinegar are ingested with meals composed of complex carbohydratesin these situations vinegar attenuated ppg by 20 compared to placebo2009 s karger ag basel
