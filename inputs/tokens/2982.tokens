several studies suggest that regular consumption of nuts mostly walnuts may have beneficial effects against oxidative stress mediated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancerwalnuts contain several phenolic compounds which are thought to contribute to their biological propertiesthe present study reports the total phenolic contents and antioxidant properties of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts obtained from walnut juglans regia l seed green husk and leafthe total phenolic contents were determined by the folinciocalteu method and the antioxidant activities assessed by the ability to quench the stable free radical 22diphenyl1picrylhydrazyl dpph and to inhibit the 22azobis2amidinopropane dihydrochloride aaphinduced oxidative hemolysis of human erythrocytesmethanolic seed extract presented the highest total phenolic content 116 mg gaeg of extract and dpph scavenging activity ec50 of 0143 mgml followed by leaf and green huskin petroleum ether extracts antioxidant action was much lower or absentunder the oxidative action of aaph all methanolic extracts significantly protected the erythrocyte membrane from hemolysis in a time and concentrationdependent manner although leaf extract inhibitory efficiency was much stronger ic50 of 0060 mgml than that observed for green husks and seeds ic50 of 0127 and 0121 mgml respectivelywalnut methanolic extracts were also assayed for their antiproliferative effectiveness using human renal cancer cell lines a498 and 769p and the colon cancer cell line caco2all extracts showed concentrationdependent growth inhibition toward human kidney and colon cancer cellsconcerning a498 renal cancer cells all extracts exhibited similar growth inhibition activity ic50 values between 0226 and 0291 mgml while for both 769p renal and caco2 colon cancer cells walnut leaf extract showed a higher antiproliferative efficiency ic50 values of 0352 and 0229 mgml respectively than green husk or seed extractsthe results obtained herein strongly indicate that walnut tree constitute an excellent source of effective natural antioxidants and chemopreventive agentscopyright 2009 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
