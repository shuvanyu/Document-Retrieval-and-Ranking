background data concerning the longterm association between nut consumption and weight change in a freeliving population are sparseobjective the objective was to determine the relation between nut consumption and longterm weight changedesign the participants were 51188 women in the nurses health study ii aged 2045 y who had no cardiovascular disease diabetes or cancerwe prospectively evaluated the dietary intake of nuts and subsequent weight changes from 1991 to 1999results women who reported eating nuts 2 timeswk had slightly less mean  se weight gain 504  012 kg than did women who rarely ate nuts 555  004 kg p for trend  0001for the same comparison when total nut consumption was subdivided into peanuts and tree nuts the results were similar ie less weight gain in women eating either peanuts or tree nuts 2 timeswkthe results were similar in normalweight overweight and obese participantsin multivariate analyses in which lifestyle and other dietary factors were controlled for we found that greater nut consumption 2 timeswk compared with neveralmost never was associated with a slightly lower risk of obesity hazard ratio 077 95 ci 057 102 p for trend  0003conclusions higher nut consumption was not associated with greater body weight gain during 8 y of followup in healthy middleaged womeninstead it was associated with a slightly lower risk of weight gain and obesitythe results of this study suggest that incorporating nuts into diets does not lead to greater weight gain and may help weight control
