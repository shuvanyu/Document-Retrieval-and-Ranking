backgroundobjectives walnuts have been shown to reduce serum lipids in shortterm wellcontrolled feeding trialslittle information exists on the effect and sustainability of walnut consumption for longer duration in a freeliving situationsubjectsmethods a randomized crossover design in which 87 subjects with normal to moderate high plasma total cholesterol were initially assigned to a walnutsupplemented diet or habitual control diet for a 6month period then switched to the alternate dietary intervention for a second 6month periodeach subject attended seven clinics 2 months apartat each clinic body weight was measured and in five clinics months 0 4 6 10 and 12 a blood sample was collectedresults our study showed that supplementing a habitual diet with walnuts 12 of total daily energy intake equivalent improves the plasma lipid profilethis beneficial effect was more significant in subjects with high plasma total cholesterol at baselinesignificant changes in serum concentrations of total cholesterol p002 and triglycerides p003 were seen and nearly significant changes in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc p006 were foundno significant change was detected in either highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol ldl to hdl ratioconclusions including walnuts as part of a habitual diet favorably altered the plasma lipid profilethe lipidlowering effects of walnuts were more evident among subjects with higher lipid baseline values precisely those people with greater need of reducing plasma total and ldlc
