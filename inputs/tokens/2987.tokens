objective recent studies have suggested that nuts have favorable effects beyond lipid loweringwe aimed to investigate effect of the antep pistachio pistacia vera l on blood glucose lipid parameters endothelial function inflammation and oxidation in healthy young men living in a controlled environmentmethods a mediterranean diet was administered to normolipidemic 32 healthy young men mean age 22 y range 2124 for 4 wkafter 4 wk participants continued to receive the mediterranean diet but pistachio was added for 4 wk by replacing the monounsaturated fat content constituting approximately 20 of daily caloric intakefasting blood samples and brachial endothelial function measurements were performed at baseline and after each dietresults compared with the mediterranean diet the pistachio diet decreased glucose p0001 8885 lowdensity lipoprotein p0001 232119 total cholesterol p0001 21299 and triacylglycerol p0008 138338 significantly and highdensity lipoprotein p0069 31117 nonsignificantlytotal cholesterolhighdensity lipoprotein and lowdensity lipoproteinhighdensity lipoprotein ratios decreased significantly p0001 for boththe pistachio diet significantly improved endotheliumdependent vasodilation p0002 30 relative increase decreased serum interleukin6 total oxidant status lipid hydroperoxide and malondialdehyde and increased superoxide dismutase p0001 for all whereas there was no significant change in creactive protein and tumor necrosis factoralpha levelsconclusion in this trial we demonstrated that a pistachio diet improved blood glucose level endothelial function and some indices of inflammation and oxidative status in healthy young menthese findings are in accordance with the idea that nuts in particular pistachio nuts have favorable effects beyond lipid lowering that deserve to be evaluated with prospective followup studiescopyright 2010published by elsevier inc
