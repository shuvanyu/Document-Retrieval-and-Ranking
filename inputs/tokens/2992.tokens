the present pilot study analyzed for the first time the in vivo effect of medjool or hallawi date consumption by healthy subjects on serum glucose lipids and oxidative stresstotal phenolics concentration in the hallawi versus medjool dates was greater by 2031the major proportion of the soluble phenolics in both date varieties consisted of phenolic acids mainly ferulic acid and coumaric acid derivatives and also chlorogenic and caffeic acid derivativesunlike the medjool dates hallawi dates contained a significant proportion of catechins as wellin addition both varieties contained a quercetin derivativeboth date varieties possess antioxidative properties in vitro but the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power of hallawi versus medjool dates was higher by 24ten healthy subjects consumed for a period of 4 weeks 100 gday of either medjool or hallawi datesthe date consumption did not significantly affect the subjects body mass index bmi their serum total cholesterol or their cholesterol levels in the vldl ldl or hdl fractionsmost important fasting serum glucose and triacylglycerol levels were not increased after consumption of either date variety and serum triacylglycerol levels even significantly p  005 decreased by 8 or 15 after medjool or hallawi date consumption respectivelybasal serum oxidative status was significantly p  001 decreased by 33 as compared to the levels observed before consumption after hallawi but not medjool date consumptionsimilarly the susceptibility of serum to aaphinduced lipid peroxidation decreased by 12 but only after hallawi date consumptionin agreement with the above results serum activity of the hdlassociated antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 pon1 significantly increased by 8 after hallawi date consumptionit is concluded that date consumption and mainly the hallawi variety by healthy subjects despite their high sugar content demonstrates beneficial effects on serum triacylglycerol and oxidative stress and does not worsen serum glucose and lipidlipoprotein patterns and thus can be considered an antiatherogenic nutrient
