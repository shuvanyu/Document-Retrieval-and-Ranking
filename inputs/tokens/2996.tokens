3hcp 55940 a radiolabeled synthetic cannabinoid which is 10100 times more potent in vivo than delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol was used to characterize and localize a specific cannabinoid receptor in brain sectionsthe potencies of a series of natural and synthetic cannabinoids as competitors of 3hcp 55940 binding correlated closely with their relative potencies in several biological assays suggesting that the receptor characterized in our in vitro assay is the same receptor that mediates behavioral and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids including human subjective experienceautoradiography of cannabinoid receptors in brain sections from several mammalian species including human reveals a unique and conserved distribution binding is most dense in outflow nuclei of the basal gangliathe substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidusand in the hippocampus and cerebellumgenerally high densities in forebrain and cerebellum implicate roles for cannabinoids in cognition and movementsparse densities in lower brainstem areas controlling cardiovascular and respiratory functions may explain why high doses of delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol are not lethal
