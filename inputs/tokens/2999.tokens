the aim of these studies was to evaluate the potential of some nutritional approaches to prevent or reduce the body load of organochlorines oc in humansstudy 1 compared plasma oc concentrations between vegans and omnivores while study 2 verified if the dietary fat substitute olestra could prevent the increase in oc concentrations that is generally observed in response to a weightreducing programmein study 1 nine vegans and fifteen omnivores were recruited and the concentrations of twentysix oc betahexachlorocyclohexane betahch p pdichlorodiphenyldichloroethane p pdde p pdichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane p pddt hexachlorobenzene mirex aldrin alphachlordane gammachlordane oxychlordane cisnonachlor transnonachlor polychlorinated biphenyl pcb nos28 52 99 101 105 118 128 138 153 156 170 180 183 and 187 and aroclor 1260 were determinedin study 2 the concentrations of these twentysix oc were measured before and after weight loss over 3 months in thirtyseven obese men assigned to one of the following treatments standard group 33  fat diet n 13 fatreduced group 25  fat diet n 14 or fatsubstituted group 13 of dietary lipids substituted by olestra n 10in study 1 plasma concentrations of five oc compounds aroclor 1260 and pcb 99 pcb 138 pcb 153 and pcb 180 were significantly lower in vegans compared with omnivoresin study 2 betahch was the only oc which decreased in the fatsubstituted group while increasing in the other two groups p  0045in conclusion there was a trend toward lesser contamination in vegans than in omnivores and olestra had a favourable influence on betahch but did not prevent plasma hyperconcentration of the other oc during ongoing weight loss
