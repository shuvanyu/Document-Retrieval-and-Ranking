in east greenland polar bears ursus maritimus anthropogenic organohalogen compounds ohcs eg polychlorinated biphenyls dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and polybrominated diphenyl ethers contributed to renal lesions and are believed to reduce bone mineral densitybecause ohcs are also hepatotoxic we investigated liver histology of 32 subadult 24 adult female and 23 adult male east greenland polar bears sampled during 19992002light microscopic changes consisted of nuclear displacement from the normal central cytoplasmic location in parenchymal cells mononuclear cell infiltrations mainly portally and as lipid granulomas mild bile duct proliferation accompanied by fibrosis and fat accumulation in hepatocytes and pluripotent ito cellslipid accumulation in ito cells and bile duct hyperplasia accompanied by portal fibrosis were correlated to age whereas no changes were associated with either sex or season summer vs winterfor adult females hepatocytic intracellular fat increased significantly with concentrations of the sum of hexachlorocyclohexanes as was the case for lipid granulomas and hexachlorobenzene in adult malesbased on these relationships and the nature of the chronic inflammation we suggest that these findings were caused by aging and longterm exposure to ohcstherefore these changes may be used as biomarkers for ohc exposure in wildlife and humansto our knowledge this is the first time liver histology has been evaluated in relation to ohc concentrations in a mammalian wildlife species and the information is important to future polar bear conservation strategies and health assessments of humans relying on ohccontaminated food resources
