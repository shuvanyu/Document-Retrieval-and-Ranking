we successfully optimized an analytical method using gel permeation chromatography followed by direct sample introduction comprehensive twodimensional gas chromatography with timeofflight mass spectrometry to quantify multiple groups of targeted persistent organic pollutants and halogenated natural products hnps simultaneously in fish oil samplesthis new method has a wider analytical scope than the traditional approach to use multiple methods to cover each class of compoundsour analysis revealed that the relatively more volatile and lighter organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs organochlorine pesticides and other smaller organohalogen compounds were still present in two brands of pcbfree cod liver oils albeit at much lower levels than in an untreated commercial samplemoreover the less volatile organic compounds such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers and brominated hnps were detected at similar levels in all three cod liver oilsthis suggests that the commercial molecular distillation treatment used for removal of organicinorganic toxic contaminants is only effective for the lighter organic contaminants
