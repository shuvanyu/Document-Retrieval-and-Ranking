background isothiocyanates itcs hydrolysis products from glucosinolates are a family of biologically active compounds originating from cruciferous vegetablesmany itcs are assumed to have cancer preventive effects and to further evaluate these potential health effects reliable biomarkers of itc exposure are neededaim of the study in this study we investigated the ability of urinary itc excretion to reflect a low or high daily intake of cruciferous vegetablesmethods the design was a controlled human crossover study n  6subjects consumed a selfrestricted glucosinolatefree diet 48 h before the studyday where a basic diet supplemented with 80 or 350 g of mixed cruciferous vegetables was consumedall urine was collected in intervals during the 48 h period after ingestion of the cruciferous vegetablestotal itc in the cruciferous mixture and total itc and their metabolites in urine was quantified as the cyclocondensation product of 12bezenedithiol by high performance liquid chromatographyresults the total urinary excretion of itcs correlated significantly with the two doses of itc from diets with high or low cruciferous content r s  090 p  001the fraction of urinary itc excreted was 6902  1157 and 7453  839 of the amounts ingested for 80 and 350 g cruciferous vegetables respectivelyconclusion the results in this study indicate that the urinary excretion of itcs measured by use of the cyclocondesation reaction is a useful and precise tool that may be used as a biomarker of itc exposure in population based studies
