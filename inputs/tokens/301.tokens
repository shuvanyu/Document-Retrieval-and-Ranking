purpose we compared the effect of 3 animal protein sources on urinary stone riskmaterials and methods a total of 15 healthy subjects completed a 3phase randomized crossover metabolic studyduring each 1week phase subjects consumed a standard metabolic diet containing beef chicken or fishserum chemistry and 24hour urine samples collected at the end of each phase were compared using mixed model repeated measures analysisresults serum and urinary uric acid were increased for each phasebeef was associated with lower serum uric acid than chicken or fish 65 vs 70 and 73 mgdl respectively each p 005fish was associated with higher urinary uric acid than beef or chicken 741 vs 638 and 641 mg per day p  0003 and 004 respectivelyno significant difference among phases was noted in urinary ph sulfate calcium citrate oxalate or sodiummean saturation index for calcium oxalate was highest for beef 248 although the difference attained significance only compared to chicken 167 p  002 but not to fish 179 p  008conclusions consuming animal protein is associated with increased serum and urine uric acid in healthy individualsthe higher purine content of fish compared to beef or chicken is reflected in higher 24hour urinary uric acidhowever as reflected in the saturation index the stone forming propensity is marginally higher for beef compared to fish or chickenstone formers should be advised to limit the intake of all animal proteins including fishcopyright  2014 american urological association education and research incpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
