performance of sbr treatment for nitrogen removal from tannery is evaluated for a wide range of wastewater temperature between 7 and 30 degrees c a pilotscale sbr unit fed with plainsettled wastewater is operated on site for this purposeeffective nitrogen removal is sustained by adjustment of the sludge age from 28 to 5 daysconcentration profiles of nitrogen compounds within a selected complete sbr cycle during the steady state operation at different wastewater temperatures and sludge ages are evaluated by model simulationsystem performance is also interpreted in terms of modeling and stoichiometric calculationadditional nitrate loss was observed during aerobic period when the aeration intensity was reduced by the factor of 50
