early puberty onset is associated with hormonerelated cancers but whether diet in childhood influences pubertal timing is controversialwe examined the association of protein intake in early and midchildhood with the ages at takeoff of the pubertal growth spurt ato peak height velocity aphv and menarche in girls and voice break in boys using data from the longitudinal dortmund nutritional and anthropometric longitudinally designed studyamong participants who provided 3d weighed dietary records at 12 mo 1824 mo 34 y and 56 y 112 had sufficient anthropometric measurements between 6 and 13 y to allow estimation of atolifecourse plots were used to identify critical periods of total animal and vegetable protein intake percentage of total energy intake for pubertal timingat these ages the association between tertiles of protein intake t1t3 and the outcomes was investigated using multiple linear regression analysisa higher total and animal protein intake at 56 y was related to an earlier atoin the highest tertile of animal protein intake at 56 y ato occurred 06 y earlier than in the lowest mean 95 ci t1 96 9499 vs t2 94 9197 vs t3 90 8793 y ptrend  0003 adjusted for sex total energy breastfeeding birth year and paternal university degreesimilar findings were seen for aphv ptrend  0001 and the timing of menarchevoice break ptrend  002conversely a higher vegetable protein intake at 34 and 56 y was related to later ato aphv and menarchevoice break ptrend  002004these results suggest that animal and vegetable protein intake in midchildhood might be differentially related to pubertal timing
