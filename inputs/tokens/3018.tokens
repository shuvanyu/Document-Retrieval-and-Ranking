in contrast to the use of hormonal doping agents in sports to enhance the performance of athletes in the livestock industry hormonal growth promoters anabolics are used to increase the production of muscle meatthis leads to international disputes about the safety of meat originating from animals treated with such anabolicsas a consequence of the total ban in the eu of all hormonal active growth promoters hormones in livestock production in contrast to their legal use egof five such hormones 17betaestradiol testosterone progesterone trenbolone and zeranol as small solid ear implants and two hormones as feed additives for feedlot heifers melengestrol acetate and for swine ractopamine in the usa the regulatory controls also differ sharply between the eu and the usain the eu the treatment of slaughter animals is the regulatory offence that has to be controlled in inspection programsin the usa testing for compliance of a regulatory maximum residue level in the edible product muscle fat liver or kidney is the purpose of the inspection program if anythe eu inspection programs focus on sample materials that are more suitable for testing for banned substances especially if the animals are still on the farm such as urine and feces or hairin the case of slaughtered animals the more favored sample materials are bile blood eyes and sometimes liveronly in rare occasions is muscle meat sampledthis happens only in the case of import controls or in monitoring programs of meat sampled in butcher shops or supermarketsas a result data on hormone concentrations in muscle meat samples from the eu market are very rare and are obtained in most cases from small programs on an ad hoc basiseu data for natural hormones in meat are even rarer because of the absence of legal natural levels for these hormones in compliance testingwith the exception of samples from the application sites  in the eu the site of injection of liquid hormone preparations or the site of application of pour on preparations  the hormone concentrations observed in meat samples of illegally treated animals are typically in the range of a few micrograms per kilogram ppb down to a few tenths of a microgram per kilogramin the eu dozens of illegal hormones are used and the number of active compounds is still expandingbesides estrogenic androgenic and progestagenic compounds also thyreostatic corticosteroidal and betaadrenergic compounds are used alone or in smart combinationsan overview is given of the compounds identified on the eu black marketan estimate is also given of the probability of consumption in the eu of highly contaminated meat from the application sites in cattlefinally some data are presented on the concentration of estradiol in bovine meat from animals treated and not treated with hormone implantsthese data are compared with the recent findings for estradiol concentrations in hens eggsfrom this comparison the preliminary conclusion is that hens eggs are the major source of 17alpha and 17betaestradiol in the consumers daily normal diet
