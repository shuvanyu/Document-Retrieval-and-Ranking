background adrenarche is the increase in adrenal androgen aa production starting in childhooduntil now it has been unknown whether or not nutritional factors modulate adrenarcheobjective the objective was to examine whether body composition and certain dietary intakes are associated with aa production in children after accounting for urinary indicators of major adrenarcherelated steroidogenic enzymesdesign androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites were profiled by gas chromatographymass spectrometry in 24h urine samples of 137 healthy prepubertal children aged 312 y for whom birth characteristics growth velocity data and 3d weigheddiet record information were availableassociations of the sum of c19 metabolites reflecting daily aa secretion with nutritional factors fat mass fm fatfree mass ffm nutrient intakes glycemic index and glycemic load and aarelevant estimates of steroidogenic enzyme were examined in stepwise multiple regression models adjusted for age sex urine volume and total energy intakeenzyme activity estimates were calculated by using specific urinary steroid metabolite ratiosresults of the nutritionrelevant predictors fm p  00001 explained most of the variation of aa secretion r2  5animal protein intake was also positively associated with aa secretion p  005 which explained 1 of its variationffm p  01 and total protein intake p  005 showed positive trendsthe difference in daily aa secretion between the lowest and highest quartile of fm was comparable to that between the lowest and highest estimated activity of one of the major steroidogenic enzymesconclusions body fat mass may relevantly influence prepubertal adrenarchal androgen statusin addition animal protein intake may also make a small contribution to aa secretion in children
