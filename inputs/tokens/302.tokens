there is growing evidence on the association between longterm exposure to pesticides in occupational settings and an elevated rate of chronic diseases including different types of cancerhowever data on nonoccupational exposures are scarce to draw any conclusionthe objective of this study was to investigate the putative associations of environmental pesticide exposures in the general population with several cancer sites and to discuss potential carcinogenic mechanisms by which pesticides develop cancera populationbased casecontrol study was conducted among people residing in 10 health districts from andalusia south spain to estimate the risk of cancer at different siteshealth districts were categorized into areas of high and low environmental pesticide exposure based on two quantitative criteria number of hectares devoted to intensive agriculture and pesticide sales per capitathe study population consisted of 34205 cancer cases and 1832969 age and health district matched controlsdata were collected by computerized hospital records minimum dataset between 1998 and 2005prevalence rates and the risk of cancer at most organ sites were significantly higher in districts with greater pesticide use related to those with lower pesticide useconditional logistic regression analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk of cancer at all sites studied odds ratios between 115 and 345 with the exception of hodgkins disease and nonhodgkin lymphomathe results of this study support and extend previous evidence from occupational studies indicating that environmental exposure to pesticides may be a risk factor for different types of cancer at the level of the general populationcopyright  2013 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
