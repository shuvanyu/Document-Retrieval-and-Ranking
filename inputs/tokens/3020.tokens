for the first time in the field of steroid residues in humans demonstration of 19norandrosterone 19na 3alphahydroxy5alphaestran17one and 19noretiocholanolone 19ne 3alphahydroxy5betaestran17one excretion in urine subsequent to boar consumption is reportedthree male volunteers agreed to consume 310 g of tissues from the edible parts meat liver heart and kidney of a boarthe three individuals delivered urine samples before and during 24 h after meal intakeafter deconjugation of phase ii metabolites purification and specific derivatisation of target metabolites the urinary extracts were analysed by mass spectrometryidentification was carried out using measurements obtained by gas chromatographyhigh resolution mass spectrometry gchrms r  7000 and liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry lcmsms positive electrospray ionisation esiquantification was realised using a quadrupole mass filter19na and 19ne concentrations in urine reached 31 to 75 microgl nearby 10 hours after boar tissue consumptionlevels returned to endogenous values 24 hours afterthese two steroids are usually exploited to confirm the exogenous administration of 19nortestosterone 19nt 17betahydroxyestr4en3one especially in the antidoping fieldwe have thus proved that eating tissues of noncastrated male pork in which 17betanandrolone is present might induce some false accusations of the abuse of nandrolone in antidopingcopyright 2000 john wiley  sons ltd
