a potent link to dairy seems to exist for three hormoneresponsive glandsacne breast cancer and prostate cancer have all been linked epidemiologically to dairy intakealthough mechanisms postulated here remain to be accurately defined the likely link involves insulinlike growth factor1 as a general stimulant synergized by the steroid hormones present in milkthe igf1 may be either absorbed from milk or stimulated by its ingestion or boththe 5alphareduced compound 5alphapregnanedione 5αp present in milk is a direct precursor of dihydrotestosterone and may act through that pathway in prostate cancer but 5αp has also recently been shown to be capable of inducing estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells upregulating cancer cells sensitivity to estrogenthe introduction of exogenous hormones and growth factors into tissues that have not evolved defensive feedback inhibition of their corresponding endogenous sources is postulated as a direct stimulatory threat to these organ systems whether for hyperplasia or neoplasia
