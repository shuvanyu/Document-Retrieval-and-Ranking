backgroundobjectives little is known about nutritional factors that influence circulating concentrations of steroid hormones which are consistently associated with risk of breast cancer for postmenopausal womenwe aimed to investigate the association between consumption of animal products and the plasma concentrations of steroid hormones and sex hormonebinding globulin shbgsubjectsmethods crosssectional analysis was conducted on plasma from 766 naturally postmenopausal womenwe measured plasma concentrations of steroid hormones and shbg and estimated dietary intakes using a 121item food frequency questionnairelogtransformed values of hormone concentrations were regressed on quartiles of intake of meat and dairy products among food items and fats proteins and cholesterol among nutrient intakeresults total red and fresh red meat consumption was negatively associated with shbg levels p for trend004 and 001 respectivelymean shbg concentrations were approximately 8 and 13 lower for women in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of total red and fresh red meat consumption respectivelypositive associations were observed between dairy product consumption and total and free estradiol concentrations p for trend002 and 003 respectivelymean concentrations of total and free estradiol were 15 and 14 higher for women in the highest quartile of dairy product consumption than for those in the lowest quartile respectivelyno associations were observed with consumption of processed meat chicken fish eggs cholesterol fats or proteinconclusions our study suggests that greater consumption of total red and fresh red meat and dairy products might influence circulating concentrations of shbg and estradiol respectivelyconfirmation and further investigation is required
