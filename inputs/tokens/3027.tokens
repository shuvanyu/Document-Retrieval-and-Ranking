the purpose of the present study was to investigate the sex hormonal and metabolic profiles in vegetarians and compare these with the profiles in omnivoresthe design of the present study was crosssectionalthe study sample of pre and postmenopausal women included fortyone omnivores and twentyone vegetariansthereafter we determined 1 plasma sex hormones 2 fasting insulin nefa as well as apoa and apob 3 bmi 4 a dietary profile 3 d dietary records 5 physical activity and 6 total faecal excretion per 72 h and total urinary excretion per 72 h vegetarians showed higher levels of sex hormonebinding globulin shbg apoa total faecal excretion per 72 h and total fibre intake as well as lower levels of apob free oestradiol free testosterone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas and bmiinterestingly after controlling for bmi significant differences between groups still persisted except for apobmoreover stepwise regression analysis showed that total fibre intake explained 152  of the variation in shbg in our cohort which accounted for the greatest source of unique varianceresults of the present study indicate that pre and postmenopausal vegetarians present higher concentrations of shbg which could be explained in part by higher levels of fibre intakethis may explain at least in part the lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes
