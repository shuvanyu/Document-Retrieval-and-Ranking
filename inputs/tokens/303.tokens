consumer concern over the quality and safety of conventional food has intensified in recent years and primarily drives the increasing demand for organically grown food which is perceived as healthier and saferrelevant scientific evidence however is scarce while anecdotal reports aboundalthough there is an urgent need for information related to health benefits andor hazards of food products of both origins generalized conclusions remain tentative in the absence of adequate comparative dataorganic fruits and vegetables can be expected to contain fewer agrochemical residues than conventionally grown alternatives yet the significance of this difference is questionable inasmuch as actual levels of contamination in both types of food are generally well below acceptable limitsalso some leafy root and tuber organic vegetables appear to have lower nitrate content compared with conventional ones but whether or not dietary nitrate indeed constitutes a threat to human health is a matter of debateon the other hand no differences can be identified for environmental contaminants egcadmium and other heavy metals which are likely to be present in food from both originswith respect to other food hazards such as endogenous plant toxins biological pesticides and pathogenic microorganisms available evidence is extremely limited preventing generalized statementsalso results for mycotoxin contamination in cereal crops are variable and inconclusive hence no clear picture emergesit is difficult therefore to weigh the risks but what should be made clear is that organic does not automatically equal safeadditional studies in this area of research are warrantedat our present state of knowledge other factors rather than safety aspects seem to speak in favor of organic food
