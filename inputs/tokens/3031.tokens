objective probiotic consumption effects on cold and influenzalike symptom incidence and duration were evaluated in healthy children during the winter seasonmethods in this doubleblind placebocontrolled study 326 eligible children 35 years of age were assigned randomly to receive placebo n  104 lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm n  110 or l acidophilus ncfm in combination with bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis bi07 n  112children were treated twice daily for 6 monthsresults relative to the placebo group single and combination probiotics reduced fever incidence by 530 p  0085 and 727 p  0009 coughing incidence by 414 p  027 and 621 p  005 and rhinorrhea incidence by 282 p  68 and 588 p  03 respectivelyfever coughing and rhinorrhea duration was decreased significantly relative to placebo by 32 single strain p  0023 and 48 strain combination p  001antibiotic use incidence was reduced relative to placebo by 684 single strain p  0002 and 842 strain combination p  0001subjects receiving probiotic products had significant reductions in days absent from group child care by 318 single strain p  002 and 277 strain combination p  001 compared with subjects receiving placebo treatmentconclusion daily dietary probiotic supplementation for 6 months was a safe effective way to reduce fever rhinorrhea and cough incidence and duration and antibiotic prescription incidence as well as the number of missed school days attributable to illness for children 3 to 5 years of age
