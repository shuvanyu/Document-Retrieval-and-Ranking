obesity is associated with complications during pregnancy and increased health risks in the newbornthe objective of the present study was to establish possible relationships between gut microbiota body weight weight gain and biochemical parameters in pregnant womenfifty pregnant women were classified according to their bmi in normalweight n 34 and overweight n 16 groupsgut microbiota composition was analysed by quantitative realtime pcr in faeces and biochemical parameters in plasma at 24 weeks of pregnancyreduced numbers of bifidobacterium and bacteroides and increased numbers of staphylococcus enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli were detected in overweight compared with normalweight pregnant womene coli numbers were higher in women with excessive weight gain than in women with normal weight gain during pregnancy while bifidobacterium and akkermansia muciniphila showed an opposite trendin the whole population increased total bacteria and staphylococcus numbers were related to increased plasma cholesterol levelsincreased bacteroides numbers were related to increased hdlcholesterol and folic acid levels and reduced tag levelsincreased bifidobacterium numbers were related to increased folic acid levelsincreased enterobacteriaceae and e coli numbers were related to increased ferritin and reduced transferrin while bifidobacterium levels showed the opposite trendtherefore gut microbiota composition is related to body weight weight gain and metabolic biomarkers during pregnancy which might be of relevance to the management of the health of women and infants
