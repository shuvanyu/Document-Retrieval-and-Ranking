background previous studies on the association between macronutrient intake and the development of abdominal obesity which carries an increased health risk have not shown a consistent pattern possibly due to mixed effects of other aspects of the food intakeobjective this study investigated the association between intake from 21 food and beverage groups and the subsequent 5year difference in waist circumferencemethods the study population consisted of 22570 women and 20126 men aged 50 to 64 years at baseline with complete data on baseline and followup waist circumference baseline diet 192 items food frequency questionnaire body mass index and selected potential confounders eg smoking status sport activities and intake of alcoholic beveragesmultiple linear regression analyses were performedresults for women 5year difference in waist circumference was inversely related to intake from red meat vegetables fruit butter and highfat dairy products whereas intake from potatoes processed meat poultry and snack foods was positively associatedfor men red meat and fruit intakes were inversely associated with 5year difference in waist circumference whereas snack foods intake was positively associatedsex differences occurred for vegetables highfat dairy products and processed meatconclusions the results suggest that a diet low in fruits and red meat and high in snack foods was associated with larger waist circumference gains in both sexesfurthermore in women a diet low in vegetables butter and highfat dairy products and high in poultry potatoes and processed meat were likely determinants of subsequent gain at the waist
