we previously reported that chickens infected with the avian adenovirus smam1 developed a unique syndrome characterized by excessive intraabdominal fat deposition accompanied by paradoxically low serum cholesterol and triglyceride levelsthere have been no previous reports of avian adenoviruses infecting humanswe screened the serum of 52 humans with obesity in bombay india for antibodies against smam1 virus using the agar gel precipitation test agpt methodbodyweights and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were compared in smam1positive pagpt and smam1negative nagpt groupsten subjects were positive for antibodies to smam1 and 42 subjects did not have antibodiesthe pagpt group had a significantly higher bodyweight p  002 and body mass index p  0001 951  21 kg and 353  15 kgm2 respectively compared with the nagpt group 801  06 kg and 307  06 kgm2 respectivelyalso the pagpt group had significantly lower serum cholesterol p  002 and triglyceride p  0001 values 465 mmoll and 145 mmoll respectively compared with the nagpt group 551 mmoll and 244 mmoll respectivelytwo subjects positive for smam1 antibodies had antibodies against each others serum suggesting the presence of antigens in one or bothwhen these two serum samples were inoculated into chicken embryos macroscopic lesions compatible with smam1 infection developedthe inoculation of serum from nagpt subjects did not produce such lesionsthe presence of increased obesity antibodies to smam1 reduced levels of blood lipids and viremia that produces a typical infection in chicken embryos suggests that smam1 or a serologically similar human virus may be involved in the cause of obesity in some humans
