the rapid increase in obesity and the associated health care costs have prompted a search for better approaches for its prevention and managementsuch efforts may be facilitated by better understanding the etiology of obesityof the several etiological factors infection an unusual causative factor has recently started receiving greater attentionin the last two decades 10 adipogenic pathogens were reported including human and nonhuman viruses scrapie agents bacteria and gut microflorasome of these pathogens are associated with human obesity but their causative role in human obesity has not been establishedthis chapter presents information about the natural hosts signs and symptoms and pathogenesis of the adipogenic microorganismsif relevant to humans infectobesity would be a relatively novel yet extremely significant concepta new perspective about the infectious etiology of obesity may stimulate additional research to assess the contribution of hitherto unknown pathogens to human obesity and possibly to prevent or treat obesity of infectious origins
