numerous clinical trials using folic acid for prevention of cardiovascular disease stroke cognitive decline and neural tube defects have been completed or are underwayyet all functions of folate are performed by tetrahydrofolate and its onecarbon derivativesfolic acid is a synthetic oxidized form not significantly found in fresh natural foods to be used it must be converted to tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase dhfrincreasing evidence suggests that this process may be slow in humanshere we show using a sensitive assay we developed that the reduction of folic acid by dhfr per gram of human liver n  6 obtained from organ donors or directly from surgery is on average less than 2 of that in rat liver at physiological phmoreover in contrast to rats there was almost a 5fold variation of dhfr activity among the human samplesthis limited ability to activate the synthetic vitamer raises issues about clinical trials using high levels of folic acidthe extremely low rate of conversion of folic acid suggests that the benefit of its use in high doses will be limited by saturation of dhfr especially in individuals possessing lower than average activitythese results are also consistent with the reports of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma and urine
