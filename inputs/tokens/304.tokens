chlorinated pesticides can contain impurities of dibenzopdioxins and dibenzofurans pcddfs and their precursors as a result of various manufacturing processes and conditionsas precursor formation of pcddfs can also be mediated by ultraviolet light uv this study investigated whether pcddfs are formed when currently used pesticides are exposed to natural sunlightformulations containing pentachloronitrobenzene pcnb n2 and 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 24d n1 were exposed to sunlight in quartz tubes and the concentration of 93 pcddf congeners were monitored over timeconsiderable formation of pcddfs was observed in both pcnb formulations by up to 5600 to a maximum concentration of 57000 μg pcddf kg1 as well as the 24d formulation by 3000 to 140 μg pcddf kg1teq also increased by up to 980 to a maximum concentration of 28 μg kg1 in pcnb but did not change in the 24d formulationassuming similar yields as observed in the present study as a worst case scenario the use of pcnb in australia may result in the formation of 155 g teq annum1 contributed primarily by ocdd formationthis warrants detailed evaluations on the contemporary release of pcddfs to the environment after the use of pesticideschanges in congener profiles including the ratio of pcdds to pcdfs df ratio suggest that pesticide sources of pcddfs after sunlight exposure may not be recognized based on matching source fingerprints established from manufacturing impuritiesthese changes also provide preliminary insights into the possible formation routes and types of precursors involvedcopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
