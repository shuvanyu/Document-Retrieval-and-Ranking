a survey of a broad range of chocolate and cocoacontaining products marketed in the united states was conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of flavan3ol monomers oligomers and polymers which can be grouped into a class of compounds called procyanidinssamples consisted of the three or four topselling products within the following six categories natural cocoa powder unsweetened baking chocolate dark chocolate semisweet baking chips milk chocolate and chocolate syrupcomposite samples were characterized for percent fat  fat percent nonfat cocoa solids  nfcs antioxidant level by orac total polyphenols epicatechin catechin total monomers and flavan3ol oligomers and polymers procyanidinson a gram weight basis epicatechin and catechin content of the products follow in decreasing order cocoa powder  baking chocolate  dark chocolate  baking chips  milk chocolate  chocolate syrupanalysis of the monomer and oligomer profiles within product categories shows there are two types of profiles 1 products that have high monomers with decreasing levels of oligomers and 2 products in which the level of dimers is equal to or greater than the monomersresults show a strong correlation r2  0834 of epicatechin to the level of  nfcs and also very good correlations for n  25 oligomers to  nfcsa weaker correlation was observed for catechin to  nfcs r2  0680other analyses show a similar high degree of correlation with epicatechin and n  25 oligomers to total polyphenols with catechin being less well correlated to total polyphenolsa lesser but still good correlation exists between the calculated percent cacao calcd  cacao content a proxy for percent cacao and these same flavanol measures with catechin again showing a lesser degree of correlation to calcd  cacaoprincipal component analysis pca shows that the products group discretely into five classes 1 cocoa powder 2 baking chocolate 3 dark chocolate and semisweet chips 4 milk chocolates and 5 syruppca also shows that most factors group closely together including the antioxidant activity total polyphenols and the flavan3ol measures with the exception of catechin and  fat in the product which group separatelybecause catechin distribution appears to be different from the other flavan3ol measures an analysis of the epicatechin to catechin ratio was done indicating there is a 5fold variation in this measure across the products studiedthe cocoacontaining products tested range from cocoa powder with 22734  1723 mg of procyanidins per serving to 2575  991 mg of procyanidins per serving for chocolate syrupthese results are discussed with respect to other studies on commercial products the bioavailability of the flavanols and the possible role of processing on the amount of catechin in products
