purpose soy isoflavones structurally similar to endogenous estrogens may affect breast cancer through both hormonallymediated and nonhormonally related mechanismsalthough the effects of soy are not well understood some breast cancer survivors increase their soy intake postdiagnosis in attempt to improve their prognosistherefore we examined the role of soy isoflavone intake and the risk of breast cancer recurrence by hormone receptor status menopausal status and tamoxifen therapymaterials and methods a cohort of 1954 female breast cancer survivors diagnosed during 19972000 was prospective followed for 631 years and 282 breast cancer recurrences were ascertainedisoflavone intake was assessed by mailing modified block and supplemental soy food frequency questionnaires to participants on average 23 months postdiagnosisrisk of breast cancer recurrence measured by hazard ratios hr and 95 confidence intervals ci was estimated using multivariable delayedentry cox proportional hazards modelsresults suggestive trends for a reduced risk of cancer recurrence were observed with increasing quintiles of daidzein and glycetin intake compared to no intake among postmenopausal women p for trend p  08 for daidzein p  06 for glycetin and among tamoxifen users p  10 for daidzein p  05 for glycetinamong postmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen there was an approximately 60 reduction in breast cancer recurrence comparing the highest to the lowest daidzein intakes 1453 micrograms µgday versus  77 µgday hr 048 95 ci 021079 p  008conclusion soy isoflavones consumed at levels comparable to those in asian populations may reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in women receiving tamoxifen therapy and moreover appears not to interfere with tamoxifen efficacyfurther confirmation is required in other large prospective studies before recommendations regarding soy intake can be issued to breast cancer survivors
