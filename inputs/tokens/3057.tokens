in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting many species the key event in disease pathogenesis is the accumulation of an abnormal conformational isoform prpsc of the hostencoded cellular prion protein prpcwhile the precise mechanism of the prpc to prpsc conversion is not understood it is clear that host prpc expression is a prerequisite for effective infectious prion propagationalthough there have been many studies on tses in mammalian species little is known about tse pathogenesis in fishhere we show that while gilthead sea bream sparus aurata orally challenged with brain homogenates prepared either from a bse infected cow or from scrapie infected sheep developed no clinical prion disease the brains of tsefed fish sampled two years after challenge did show signs of neurodegeneration and accumulation of deposits that reacted positively with antibodies raised against sea bream prpthe control groups fed with brains from uninfected animals showed no such signsremarkably the deposits developed much more rapidly and extensively in fish inoculated with bseinfected material than in the ones challenged with the scrapieinfected brain homogenate with numerous deposits being proteinase kresistantthese plaquelike aggregates exhibited congophilia and birefringence in polarized light consistent with an amyloidlike componentthe neurodegeneration and abnormal deposition in the brains of fish challenged with prion especially bse raises concerns about the potential risk to public healthas fish aquaculture is an economically important industry providing high protein nutrition for humans and other mammalian species the prospect of farmed fish being contaminated with infectious mammalian prpsc or of a prion disease developing in farmed fish is alarming and requires further evaluation
