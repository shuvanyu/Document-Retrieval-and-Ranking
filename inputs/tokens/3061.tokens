the objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of clostridium difficile cd among different age and production groups of swine in a vertically integrated swine operation in texas in 2006 and to compare our isolates to other animal and human isolatesresults are based on 131 cd isolates from 1008 swine fecal samples and pork trim samples overall prevalence of 13the prevalence number positivenumber tested in production type of cd was different between the groups por0001 and was highest among suckling piglets at 500 61122 followed by 238 34143 for lactating sows and effluent from the farrowing barn 84 10119 for nursery 65 462 for pork products 39 15382 for growerfinisher and 39 7180 for breeding boars and sowsof the 131 isolates 122 were positive by pcr for both toxins a tcda and b tcdb genes 129 isolates harbored a 39 base pair deletion in the tcdc gene 120 isolates were toxinotype v and all 131 of the isolates were positive for the binary toxin gene cdtball isolates were resistant to cefoxitin ciprofloxacin and imipenem whereas all were sensitive to metronidazole piperacillintazobactam amoxicillinclavulanic acid and vancomycinthe majority of isolates were resistant to clindamycin resistant or intermediate to ampicillin and sensitive to tetracycline and chloramphenicolthere was an increased p0001 number of isolates for the timeframe of september to february compared to march to august
