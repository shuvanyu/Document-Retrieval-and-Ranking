until recently reports on methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa in food production animals were mainly limited to occasional detections in dairy cattle mastitishowever since 2005 a mrsa clone cc398 has been reported colonizing pigs veal calves and broiler chickens and infecting dairy cowsmany aspects of its prevalence in pigs remain unclearin other livestock colonizing capacity and reservoir status still require elucidationmrsa cc398 has also been detected in meat but as for other mrsa the risk this poses is somewhat unclearcurrently the most worrying aspect of mrsa cc398 appears to be its capacity to spread to humansthis might complicate mrsa control measures in human healthcare urging research into risk factors and transmission routesalthough infections with mrsa cc398 are much less reported than carriage more investigation into its pathogenic potential is requiredmoreover the origin and evolution of this clone remain unknown
