background recent research has demonstrated that many swine and swine farmers in the netherlands and canada are colonized with mrsahowever no studies to date have investigated carriage of mrsa among swine and swine farmers in the united states usmethods we sampled the nares of 299 swine and 20 workers from two different production systems in iowa and illinois comprising approximately 87000 live animalsmrsa isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge using smai and eagi restriction enzymes and by multi locus sequence typing mlstpcr was used to determine sccmec type and presence of the pvl generesults in this pilot study overall mrsa prevalence in swine was 49 147299 and 45 920 in workersthe prevalence of mrsa carriage among production system as swine varied by age ranging from 36 1130 in adult swine to 100 6060 of animals aged 9 and 12 weeksthe prevalence among production system as workers was 64 914mrsa was not isolated from production system bs swine or workersisolates examined were not typeable by pfge when smai was used but digestion with eagi revealed that the isolates were clonal and were not related to common human types in iowa usa100 usa300 and usa400mlst documented that the isolates were st398conclusions these results show that colonization of swine by mrsa was very common on one swine production system in the midwestern us suggesting that agricultural animals could become an important reservoir for this bacteriummrsa strain st398 was the only strain documented on this farmfurther studies are examining carriage rates on additional farms
