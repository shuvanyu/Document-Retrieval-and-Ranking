background alcoholbased hand rubs abhrs are an effective means of decreasing the transmission of bacterial pathogensalcohol is not effective against clostridium difficile sporeswe examined the retention of c difficile spores on the hands of volunteers after abhr use and the subsequent transfer of these spores through physical contactmethods nontoxigenic c difficile spores were spread on the bare palms of 10 volunteersuse of 3 abhrs and chlorhexidine soapandwater washing were compared with plain water rubbing alone for removal of c difficile sporespalmar cultures were performed before and after hand decontamination by means of a plate stamping methodtransferability of c difficile after application of abhr was tested by having each volunteer shake hands with an uninoculated volunteerresults plain water rubbing reduced palmar culture counts by a mean  standard deviation sd of 157  011 log10 colonyforming units cfu per cm2 and this value was set as the zero point for the other productscompared with water washing chlorhexidine soap washing reduced spore counts by a mean  sd of 089  034 log10 cfu per cm2 among the abhrs isagel accounted for a reduction of 011  020 log10 cfu per cm2 p  005 endure for a reduction of 037  042 log10 cfu per cm2 p  010 and purell for a reduction of 014  033 log10 cfu per cm2 p  005there were no statistically significant differences between the reductions achieved by the abhrs only endure had a reduction statistically different from that for water control rubbing p  040after abhr use handshaking transferred a mean of 30 of the residual c difficile spores to the hands of recipientsconclusions hand washing with soap and water is significantly more effective at removing c difficile spores from the hands of volunteers than are abhrsresidual spores are readily transferred by a handshake after use of abhr
