a correlation between national pigmeat consumption and mortality rates from chronic liver disease cld across developed countries was reported in 1985one possible mechanism explaining this may be hepatitis e infection spread via pig meatwe aimed to reexamine the original association in more recent international dataregression models were used to estimate associations between national pigmeat consumption and cld mortality adjusting for confoundersdata on cld mortality alcohol consumption hepatitis b virus hbv and hepatitis c virus hcv seroprevalence for 18 developed countries 19902000 were obtained from who databasesdata on national pigmeat and beef consumption were obtained from the un databaseunivariate regression showed that alcohol and pigmeat consumption were associated with mortality from cld but beef consumption hbv and hcv seroprevalence were nota 1 litre per capita increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an increase in mortality from cld in excess of 16 deaths100000 populationa 10 kg higher national annual average per capita consumption of pork meat was associated with an increase in mortality from cld of between 4 and 5 deaths100000 populationmultivariate regression showed that alcohol pigmeat consumption and hbv seroprevalence were independently associated with mortality from cld but hcv seroprevalence was notpigmeat consumption remained independently associated with mortality from cld in developed countries in the 19902000 periodfurther work is needed to establish the mechanism
