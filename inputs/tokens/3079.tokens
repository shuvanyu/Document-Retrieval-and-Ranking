although uncommon in north america hepatitis e virus hev has been identified in some industrialized countries in patients without a history of travel to hevendemic countriesits presence is ubiquitous worldwide in swine populationszoonotic transmission of swine hev to non human primates has been achieved experimentally and transmission of hev after ingestion of contaminated raw or undercooked meat is well documentedin canada so far no hev outbreak has been documented but hev genotype 3 strains have been identified in sera and faecal samples of swine originthe objective of the present study was to determine the viral load of hev in liver loin bladder hepatic lymph node bile tonsil plasma and faeces samples of 43 pigs at slaughterfeline calicivirus fcv was used as sample process control to validate the rna extraction process as a confirmation of the absence of sample inhibitors and as an amplification controlusing fcvhev multiplex taqman rtqpcr system hev rna was detected in 14 out of the 43 animals testedhev was detected in lymph nodes 1143 bladder 1043 liver 943 bile 843 faeces 643 tonsils 343 plasma 143 samples from infected animalsno hevpositive loin samples were observedviral loads of 103 to 107 copiesg were estimated in positive liver and bile samplescrown copyright 2010published by elsevier bv all rights reserved
