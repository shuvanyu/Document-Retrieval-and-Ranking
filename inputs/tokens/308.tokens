the main sources of cadmium cd input to soils have been phosphate fertilizers and deposition from airin organic farming phosphate fertilizers are not used which may in the long term result in lower cd levelsin the present study feed kidney liver and manure from growingfinishing pigs raised conventionally and organically on the same farm were microwavedigested and analyzed for cd by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometrycd was also analyzed in soil and watera quality control program was includedthe organic pigs n  40 were raised outdoors and fed an organic feed the conventional pigs n  40 were raised indoors and given a conventional feedthe cd levels in organic and conventional feed were 399 microgkg and 518 microgkg respectivelyorganic feed contained 2 potato protein which contributed 17 of the cd contentconventional feed contained 5 beet fiber which contributed 38 of total cd contentboth feeds contained vitaminmineral mixtures with high levels of cd 991 microgkg in organic and 589 microgkg in conventional feedthere was a significant negative linear relationship between cd concentration in kidney and kidney weightthere was no significant difference in liver cd levels between organic and conventional pigs and the mean  sd was 154  30in spite of the lower level of cd in the organic feed the organic pigs had significantly higher levels in kidneys than the conventional pigs 961  195 microgkg wet weight mean  sd n  37 and 840  176 microgkg wet weight n  40 respectivelyorganic pigs had higher cd levels in manure indicating a higher cd exposure from the environment such as ingestion of soildifferences in feed compositions and bioavailability of cd from the feed components may also explain the different kidney levels of cd
