we previously studied mortality up to 1989 in 2639 members of a local union who had ever worked in poultry slaughtering and processing plants because they were exposed to oncogenic viruses present in poultryin this report cancer mortality was updated to the year 2003 for 2580 of the 2639 subjects who worked exclusively in poultry plantsmortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the us general population through the estimation of proportional mortality and standardized mortality ratios separately for each racesex group and for the whole cohortcompared to the us general population an excess of cancers of the buccal and nasal cavities and pharynx base of the tongue palate and other unspecified mouth tonsil and oropharynx nasal cavitymiddle earaccessory sinus esophagus rectosigmoidrectumanus liver and intrabiliary system myelofibrosis lymphoid leukemia and multiple myeloma was observed in particular subgroups or in the entire poultry cohortwe hypothesize that oncogenic viruses present in poultry and exposure to fumes are candidates for an etiologic role to explain the excess occurrence of at least some of these cancers in the poultry workerslarger studies which can control for confounding factors are urgently needed to determine the significance of these findings
