background many patients taking statins often complain of muscle pain and weaknessthe extent to which muscle pain reflects muscle injury is unknownmethods we obtained biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis muscle of 83 patientsof the 44 patients with clinically diagnosed statinassociated myopathy 29 were currently taking a statin and 15 had discontinued statin therapy before the biopsy minimal duration of discontinuation 3 weekswe also included 19 patients who were taking statins and had no myopathy and 20 patients who had never taken statins and had no myopathywe classified the muscles as injured if 2 or more of the muscle fibres in a biopsy sample showed damageusing reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction we evaluated the expression levels of candidate genes potentially related to myocyte injuryresults muscle injury was observed in 25 of 44 patients with myopathy and in 1 patient without myopathyonly 1 patient with structural injury had a circulating level of creatine phosphokinase that was elevated more than 1950 ul 10 the upper limit of normalexpression of ryanodine receptor 3 was significantly upregulated in patients with biopsy evidence of structural damage 17 standard error of the mean 03interpretation persistent myopathy in patients taking statins reflects structural muscle damagea lack of elevated levels of circulating creatine phosphokinase does not rule out structural muscle injuryupregulation of the expression of ryanodine receptor 3 is suggestive of an intracellular calcium leak
