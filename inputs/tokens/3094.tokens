muscle pain and weakness are frequent complaints in patients receiving 3hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzymea hmg coa reductase inhibitors statinsmany patients with myalgia have creatine kinase levels that are either normal or only marginally elevated and no obvious structural defects have been reported in patients with myalgia onlyto investigate further the mechanism that mediates statininduced skeletal muscle damage skeletal muscle biopsies from statintreated and nonstatintreated patients were examined using both electron microscopy and biochemical approachesthe present paper reports clear evidence of skeletal muscle damage in statintreated patients despite their being asymptomaticthough the degree of overall damage is slight it has a characteristic pattern that includes breakdown of the ttubular system and subsarcolemmal rupturethese characteristic structural abnormalities observed in the statintreated patients were reproduced by extraction of cholesterol from skeletal muscle fibres in vitrothese findings support the hypothesis that statininduced cholesterol lowering per se contributes to myocyte damage and suggest further that it is the specific lipidprotein organization of the skeletal muscle cell itself that renders it particularly vulnerablecopyright c 2006 pathological society of great britain and irelandpublished by john wiley  sons ltd
