cardiovascular disease cvd is the most important adult health problem in the worldepidemiological studies and laboratory experiments have shown that fruit and vegetable consumption has protective effects against cvdthe purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of consumption of two kiwifruit per day on the lipid profile antioxidants and markers of lipid peroxidation in hyperlipidemic adult men and women in taiwanfortythree subjects who had hyperlipidemia including 13 males and 30 females participated in this studythey were asked to consume two kiwifruit per day for 8 weeksanthropometric measurements were madebefore the intervention and at 4 and 8 weeks of the intervention fasting blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol triacylglycerol lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlcadditionally vitamin e and vitamin c the malondialdehyde  4hydroxy2enonenal concentration and the lag time of ldl oxidation were determinedno significant differences from baseline to 8 weeks of the intervention were detected for triacylglycerol total cholesterol or ldl cholesterolhowever after 8 weeks of consumption of kiwifruit the hdlc concentration was significantly increased and the ldl cholesterolhdlc ratio and total cholesterolhdlc ratio were significantly decreasedvitamin c and vitamin e also increased significantlyin addition the lag time of ldl oxidation and malondialdehyde  4hydroxy2enonenal had significantly changed at 4 and 8 weeks during the kiwifruit interventionregular consumption of kiwifruit might exert beneficial effects on the antioxidative status and the risk factors for cvd in hyperlipidemic subjects
