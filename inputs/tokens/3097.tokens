effective diets reduce blood lipids and oxidative damage both of which have been linked to the complications of diabetes and coronary heart diseaseour objective was to assess the effect of adding strawberries as a source of antioxidants to improve the antioxidant effect of a cholesterollowering diet dietary portfolioto this end 28 hyperlipidemic subjects who had followed the dietary portfolio consisting of soy viscous fiber plant sterol and nuts for a mean of 25 years were randomized to receive supplements of strawberries 454 gd 112 kcal or additional oat bran bread 65 gd 112 kcal approximately 2 g betaglucan control in a randomized 1month crossover study with a 2week washoutstrawberry supplementation resulted in a greater reduction in oxidative damage to lowdensity lipoprotein ldl measured as thiobarbituric acidreactive substances in the ldl fraction p  014at the end of the strawberry period reductions in ldl cholesterol and in the ratio of total to highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol were maintained close to 1year values at 134  21 and 152  17 respectively p  001 and were similar to the postoat bran bread valuesstrawberries also improved the palatability of the dietwe conclude that strawberry supplementation reduced oxidative damage to ldl while maintaining reductions in blood lipids and enhancing diet palatabilityadded fruit may improve the overall utility of diets designed to lower coronary heart disease risk
