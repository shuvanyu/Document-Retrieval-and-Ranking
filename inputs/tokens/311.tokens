the organic food market is the fastest growing food sector yet it is unclear whether organically raised food is nutritionally superior to conventionally grown food and whether consuming organic food bestows health benefitsin order to evaluate potential health benefits of organic foods we used the wellcharacterized fruit fly drosophila melanogaster as a model systemfruit flies were raised on a diets consisting of extracts of either conventionally or organically raised produce bananas potatoes raisins soy beansflies were then subjected to a variety of tests designed to assess overall fly healthflies raised on diets made from organically grown produce had greater fertility and longevityon certain food sources greater activity and greater stress resistance was additionally observed suggesting that organic food bestows positive effects on fly healthour data show that drosophila can be used as a convenient model system to experimentally test potential health effects of dietary componentsusing this system we provide evidence that organically raised food may provide animals with tangible benefits to overall health
