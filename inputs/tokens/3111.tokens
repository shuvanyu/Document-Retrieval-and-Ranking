we have previously reported that a significant improvement can be obtained in rheumatoid arthritis patients by fasting followed by an individually adjusted vegetarian diet for one yearthe patients who changed their diet could be divided into diet responders and diet nonrespondersafter the clinical trial the patients were free to change diet or medication and after approximately one year they were asked to attend a new clinical examinationwe compared the change from baseline ieat the time of study entry to the time of the followup examination for diet responders diet nonresponders and controls who ate an omnivorous dietthe following variables favoured diet responders pain score duration of morning stiffness stanford health assessment questionnaire index number of tender joints ritchies articular index number of swollen joints esr and platelet count correctedthe difference between the three groups were significant for all the clinical variables except for grip strengththere was no significant difference between the groups with regard to laboratory or anthropometric variablesat the time of the followup examination all diet responders but only half of the diet nonresponders still followed a dietour findings indicate that a group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis benefit from dietary manipulations and that the improvement can be sustained through a twoyear period
