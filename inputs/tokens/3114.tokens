the notion that dietary factors may influence rheumatoid arthritis ra has been a part of the folklore of the disease but scientific support for this has been sparsein a controlled singleblind trial we tested the effect of fasting for 710 d then consuming an individually adjusted glutenfree vegan diet for 35 mo and then consuming an individually adjusted lactovegetarian diet for 9 mo on patients with rafor all clinical variables and most laboratory variables measured the 27 patients in the fasting and vegetarian diet groups improved significantly compared with the 26 patients in the control group who followed their usual omnivorous diet throughout the study periodone year after the patients completed the trial they were reexaminedcompared with baseline the improvements measured were significantly greater in the vegetarians who previously benefited from the diet diet responders than in diet nonresponders and omnivoresthe beneficial effect could not be explained by patients psychologic characteristics antibody activity against food antigens or changes in concentrations of prostaglandin and leukotriene precursorshowever the fecal flora differed significantly between samples collected at time points at which there was substantial clinical improvement and time points at which there were no or only minor improvementsin summary the results show that some patients with ra can benefit from a fasting period followed by a vegetarian dietthus dietary treatment may be a valuable adjunct to the ordinary therapeutic armamentarium for ra
