objectives a dietary link to rheumatoid arthritis ra has been suspected and an influence on arthritic symptoms by different diets has been reportedour primary aim was to record the selfexperienced adverse food reactions in patients with raa secondary aim was to relate selfexperienced adverse reactions to dairy produce and wheat to the local mucosal reactivity observed after rectal challenge with cows milk protein cm and wheat glutenmethods a questionnaire about selfexperienced adverse reaction to food was sent to 347 ra patientsrectal challenge with cm and gluten was performed in 27 of these patients and in healthy controls n  18after a 15h challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide no and the mucosal release of myeloperoxidase mpo and eosinophil cationic protein ecp were measured by using the mucosal patch techniqueresults twentyseven per cent of the ra patients reported food intolerance fi to various foods and in particular to cm meat and wheat glutenstrong mucosal reactivity to cm was observed in 11 of the patientsmoderately increased mucosal reactivity to cm and gluten was found in 22 and 33 respectively of the patientsno relationship was found between selfexperienced adverse reactions to cm or gluten and mucosal reactivity to these proteinsconclusions perceived fi is reported frequently by ra patients with a prevalence similar to that reported previously in the general populationmucosal reactivity to cm and gluten is seen in a minor fraction of ra patients and is not related to the frequently perceived intolerance to these proteins
