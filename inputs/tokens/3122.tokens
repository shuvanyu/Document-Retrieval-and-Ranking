fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugarfree jams and stored for 6 months at 4 and 25 degrees c the jams were analyzed immediately after processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content percent polymeric color and antioxidant capacityprocessing resulted in losses of anthocyanins procyanidins chlorogenic acid and orac in both jam types but flavonols were well retainedmarked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric color valueschlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage but flavonols and orac changed littlejams stored at 4 degrees c retained higher levels of anthocyanins procyanidins and orac and had lower polymeric color values than jams stored at 25 degrees c sugarfree jams retained higher levels of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during storageblueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity
