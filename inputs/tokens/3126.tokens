chemical and cellular antioxidant activities and phenolic profiles of 11 lentil cultivars grown in the cool northern parts of the united states were investigatedindividual phenolic compounds including phenolic acids flavan3ols flavones and anthocyanins were further quantitatively investigated by hplccellular antioxidant activities caa and peroxyl radical scavenging capacity prsc were evaluated by fluorescence microplate readercultivar morton exhibited the highest individual flavan3ols catechin and epicatechin and total flavonoids as well as the highest antioxidant properties prsc and caa among all lentils testedfive phenolic acids of the benzoic types and their derivates gallic protocatechuic 234trihydroxybenzoic phydroxybenzoic acid and protocatechualdehyde and four phenolic acids of the cinnamic type chlorogenic pcoumaric mcoumaric and sinapic acid were detected in all lentil cultivarstwo flavan3ols catechin and epicatechin and one flavone luteolin were detected in all lentil cultivarsamong all phenolic compounds detected sinapic acid was the predominant phenolic acid and catechin and epicatechin were the predominant flavonoidsthese results showed that different phenotype lentils possessed considerable variations in their individual phenolic compounds as well as chemical and cellular antioxidant activitiescaffeic acid catechin epicatechin and total flavonoids significantly p  005 correlated with peroxyl radical scavenging assaycellular antioxidant assay significantly correlated with chemical antioxidant assay oracthe results from this study could be very interesting for breeding programs to improve lentils for use as functional foods
