despite its antioxidant capacity and wellknown health benefits yerba mate tea ilex paraguariensis has been shown to possess some genotoxic and mutagenic activities and to increase incidence of some types of cancerthe aim of this study was to estimate the cyto and genotoxicity of mate tea in human peripheral lymphocytes in vitrowe found that yerba mate extract induced a concentrationdependent statistically significant increase in the level of apoptotic and necrotic cells and a decrease in the nuclear division index ndimateexposed lymphocytes had a reduced transcriptional rdna activity which may be due to the stress conditions and showed an elevated production of micronucleithe fish technique revealed the appearance of an acrocentric signal in mateinduced micronuclei which suggests that under these conditions yerba mate extract may display aneugenic activitysince caffeine is one of the most abundant compounds found in the dry mass of mate we conducted additional experiments with caffeine alonewe showed that caffeine used at the same concentrations manifests a more potent cyto and genotoxic effect that may account at least in part for the disadvantageous effects observed for yerba mate extract
