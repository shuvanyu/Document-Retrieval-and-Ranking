for many years the prevailing concept was that ldl oxidation plays the central role in atherogenesisas a consequence supplementation of antioxidants particularly vitamin e became very popularunfortunately major randomized clinical trials yielded disappointing results and recent metaanalyses concluded that indiscriminate high dose vitamin e supplementation results in increased mortalitythis conclusion raised quite reasonable criticism much of which referred to the characteristics of metaanalysisin our recent study we used a markovmodel approach which is free of most of the limitations of metaanalysesour major finding was that the average qualityadjusted life years qaly of vitamin e supplemented individuals was 030 qaly 95ci 021 to 039 less than that of untreated peoplein our view this supports the view that indiscriminate supplementation of high dose vitamin e can not be recommended to the general publicin the present communication we address several recent studies that demonstrated negative effects of vitamin e and raise possible mechanisms that may be responsible for the harmful effects of vitamin e supplementationwe also review recent studies conducted with specific groups of patients that gained from vitamin e supplementation indicating that although on the average indiscriminate supplementation of high dose vitamin e is not beneficial specific populations may gain from vitamin e the challenge is to establish selection criteria that will predict who is likely to benefit from vitamin e supplementationsuch criteria may be based either on the assumption that antioxidants are likely to be beneficial for people under oxidative stress or on knowledge regarding the benefit of sick people with certain diseasesin short we adopt the view that vitamin e is a doubleedge sword that should not be consumed until criteria are defined to predict who is likely to benefit from high dose supplementation of vitamin e c 2009 international union of biochemistry and molecular biology inc
