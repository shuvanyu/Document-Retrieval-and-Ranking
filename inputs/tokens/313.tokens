the incidence of testicular cancer tc has been increasing worldwide during the last decadesthe reasons of the increase remains unknown but recent findings suggest that organochlorine pesticides ops could influence the development of tca hospitalbased casecontrol study of 50 cases and 48 controls was conducted to determine whether environmental exposure to ops is associated with the risk of tc and by measuring serum concentrations of ops including ppdichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ppdde isomer and hexachlorobenzene hcb in participantsa significant association was observed between tc and household insecticide use odds ratio or  301 95  ci 111814 oradjusted  323 95  ci 115911crude and adjusted ors for tc were also significantly associated with higher serum concentrations of total ops or  315 95  ci 100991 oradjusted  334 95  ci 1091017 in cases compared with controlsthese findings give additional support to the results of previous research that suggest that some environmental exposures to ops may be implicated in the pathogenesis of tc
