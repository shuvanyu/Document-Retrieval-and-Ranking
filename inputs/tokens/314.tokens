context exposure to organophosphate op pesticides is common and although these compounds have known neurotoxic properties few studies examined risks for children in the general populationobjective to examine the association between the concentrations of urinary dialkyl phosphate dap metabolites of ops and attention deficithyperactivity disorder adhd in children age 8 to 15 yearsparticipants and methods crosssectional data from the national health and nutrition examination survey 20002004 were available for 1139 children representative of the general us populationa structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain adhd diagnostic status based on slightly modified criteria of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disordersivresults one hundred nineteen children met the diagnostic criteria for adhdchildren with higher concentrations of urinary daps especially dimethyl alkylphosphates dmap were more likely to be diagnosed with adhda 10fold increase in dmap concentration was associated with an odds ratio or of 155 95 confidence intervals ci 114210 after adjusting for sex age raceethnicity povertyincome ratio fasting duration and urinary creatinine concentrationfor the most commonly detected dmap metabolite dimethylthiophosphate children with levels higher than the median of detectable concentrations had double the odds of adhd adjusted or 193 95 ci 123302 compared with those with nondetectable levelsconclusions these findings support the hypothesis that op exposure at levels common in us children may contribute to adhd prevalenceprospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal
