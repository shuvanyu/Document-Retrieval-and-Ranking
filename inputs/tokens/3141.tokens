background telomere length reflects biological aging and may be influenced by environmental factors including those that affect inflammatory processesobjective with data from 840 white black and hispanic adults from the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis we studied crosssectional associations between telomere length and dietary patterns and foods and beverages that were associated with markers of inflammationdesign leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reactionlength was calculated as the amount of telomeric dna t divided by the amount of a singlecopy control dna s ts ratiointake of whole grains fruit and vegetables lowfat dairy nuts or seeds nonfried fish coffee refined grains fried foods red meat processed meat and sugarsweetened soda were computed with responses to a 120item foodfrequency questionnaire completed at baselinescores on 2 previously defined empirical dietary patterns were also computed for each participantresults after adjustment for age other demographics lifestyle factors and intakes of other foods or beverages only processed meat intake was associated with telomere lengthfor every 1 servingd greater intake of processed meat the ts ratio was 007 smaller Î²  se 007  003 p  0006categorical analysis showed that participants consuming 1 serving of processed meat each week had 0017 smaller ts ratios than did nonconsumersother foods or beverages and the 2 dietary patterns were not associated with telomere lengthconclusions processed meat intake showed an expected inverse association with telomere length but other diet features did not show their expected associations
