to estimate age using dna based on telomere shortening we determined the terminal restriction fragment trf length as telomere length using southern blot analysis of peripheral human blood and blood stainsall blood stains had been stored at room temperature for 5 monthsthe average trf length clearly showed a tendency to shortening with agingthe formula for age estimation was based on a correlation between average trf length and age of the subjectsthe estimated age calculated from trf length widely depends on environmental and genetic factorshowever as long as the dna is well preserved use of our method is feasible regardless of age of the subject and can give a rough estimation of age of subjects in forensic samples that carry no morphological informationcopyright 2002 elsevier science ireland ltd
