the effects of microbial transglutaminase mtgase at different levels 0 to 08 unitsg sample on the properties of gels from lizardfish saurida undosquamis mince set at 25 degrees c for 2 h or 40 degrees c for 30 min prior to heating at 90 degrees c for 20 min were studiedbreaking force and deformation of gels increased with increasing mtgase amount added p005at the same mtgase level used gels with the prior setting at 40 degrees c for 30 min showed a higher breaking force compared with those subjected to prior setting at 25 degrees c for 2 h p005sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoretic study revealed that myosin heavy chain mhc underwent polymerization to a higher extent in the presence of mtgaseregardless of setting condition microstructure of gel added with mtgase was finer with a smaller void compared with that of gel without mtgasetherefore setting temperature affected the property of gels added with mtgasegel properties of mince obtained from lizardfish stored in ice for different times 0 to 10 d with and without mtgase at a level 06 unitsg were determinedirrespective of mtgase addition breaking force and deformation of all gels decreased as the storage time of lizardfish increased p005the addition of mtgase was able to increase both breaking force and deformation of the resulting gel produced from lizardfish kept in ice for all storage times usedtherefore both freshness and mtgase addition had the direct impact on gel properties of lizardfish mince
