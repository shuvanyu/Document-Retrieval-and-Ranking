background exposure to organochlorines has been examined as a potential risk factor for nonhodgkin lymphoma nhl with inconsistent results that may be related to limited statistical power or to imprecise exposure measurementsobjective our purpose was to examine associations between organochlorine concentrations in prediagnostic adipose tissue samples and the risk of nhlmethods we conducted a casecohort study using a prospective danish cohort of 57053 persons enrolled between 1993 and 1997within the cohort we identified 256 persons diagnosed with nhl in the populationbased nationwide danish cancer registry and randomly selected 256 subcohort personswe measured concentrations of 8 pesticides and 10 polychlorinated biphenyl pcb congeners in adipose tissue collected upon enrollmentassociations between the 18 organochlorines and nhl were analyzed in cox regression models adjusting for body mass indexresults incidence rate ratios and confidence intervals cis for interquartile range increases in concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane ddt cisnonachlor and oxychlordane were 135 95 ci 110 166 113 95 ci 094 136 and 111 95 ci 089 138 respectively with monotonic doseresponse trends for ddt and cisnonachlor based on categorical modelsthe relative risk estimates were higher for men than for womenin contrast no clear association was found between nhl and pcbsconclusion we found a higher risk of nhl in association with higher adipose tissue levels of ddt cisnonachlor and oxychlordane but no association with pcbsthis is the first study of organochlorines and nhl using prediagnostic adipose tissue samples in the exposure assessment and provides new environmental health evidence that these organochlorines contribute to nhl risk
