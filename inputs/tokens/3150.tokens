epidemiological and prospective studies indicate that comprehensive lifestyle changes may modify the progression of prostate cancerhowever the molecular mechanisms by which improvements in diet and lifestyle might affect the prostate microenvironment are poorly understoodwe conducted a pilot study to examine changes in prostate gene expression in a unique population of men with lowrisk prostate cancer who declined immediate surgery hormonal therapy or radiation and participated in an intensive nutrition and lifestyle intervention while undergoing careful surveillance for tumor progressionconsistent with previous studies significant improvements in weight abdominal obesity blood pressure and lipid profile were observed all p  005 and surveillance of lowrisk patients was safegene expression profiles were obtained from 30 participants pairing rna samples from control prostate needle biopsy taken before intervention to rna from the same patients 3month postintervention biopsyquantitative realtime pcr was used to validate array observations for selected transcriptstwoclass paired analysis of global gene expression using significance analysis of microarrays detected 48 upregulated and 453 downregulated transcripts after the interventionpathway analysis identified significant modulation of biological processes that have critical roles in tumorigenesis including protein metabolism and modification intracellular protein traffic and protein phosphorylation all p  005intensive nutrition and lifestyle changes may modulate gene expression in the prostateunderstanding the prostate molecular response to comprehensive lifestyle changes may strengthen efforts to develop effective prevention and treatmentlarger clinical trials are warranted to confirm the results of this pilot study
