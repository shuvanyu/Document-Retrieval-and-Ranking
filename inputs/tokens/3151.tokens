epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between nutrient intake hyperinsulinemia and risk of benign prostatic hyperplasis bphthis study tests the hypothesis that a lowfat highfiber diet and daily exercise would lower serum insulin and reduce the growth of serumstimulated primary prostate epithelial cells in cultureserum samples were obtained from eight overweight men before and after the pritikin residential 2week diet and exercise intervention and from seven men who were longterm followers of the lowfat highfiber diet and regular exercise lifestylethe serum was used to stimulate primary prostate epithelial cells in culturegrowth was measured after 48 and 96 h and apoptosis after 96 h at 48 h there was no significant difference in growth within the pre 2week or longterm groupsat 96 h growth was significantly reduced in the 2week 13 and in the longterm 14 groups compared to the pre dataat 96 h apoptosis was not significantly different among the three groupsfasting insulin was reduced by 30 in the 2week group and by 52 in the longterm group compared to the pre datatestosterone was unchanged in the 2week groupthe results of this study indicate that a lowfat highfiber diet and daily exercise lowers insulin and reduces growth of prostate primary epithelial cells and suggests that lifestyle may be an important factor in the development or progression of bphfuture prospective trials should address the effects of this lifestyle modification on bph symptomatology and progression
