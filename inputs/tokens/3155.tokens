summary this crosssectional study showed that although vegans had lower dietary calcium and protein intakes than omnivores veganism did not have adverse effect on bone mineral density and did not alter body compositionintroduction whether a lifelong vegetarian diet has any negative effect on bone health is a contentious issuewe undertook this study to examine the association between lifelong vegetarian diet and bone mineral density and body composition in a group of postmenopausal womenmethods one hundred and five mahayana buddhist nuns and 105 omnivorous women average age  62 range  5085 were randomly sampled from monasteries in ho chi minh city and invited to participate in the studyby religious rule the nuns do not eat meat or seafood ie vegansbone mineral density bmd at the lumbar spine ls femoral neck fn and whole body wb was measured by dxa hologic qdr 4500lean mass fat mass and percent fat mass were also obtained from the dxa whole body scandietary calcium and protein intakes were estimated from a validated food frequency questionnaireresults there was no significant difference between vegans and omnivores in lsbmd 074  014 vs 077  014 gcm2 mean  sd p  018 fnbmd 062  011 vs 063  011 gcm2 p  035 wbbmd 088  011 vs 090  012 gcm2 p  031 lean mass 32  5 vs 33  4 kg p  047 and fat mass 19  5 vs 19  5 kg p  077 either before or after adjusting for agethe prevalence of osteoporosis t scores  or  25 at the femoral neck in vegans and omnivores was 171 and 143 p  057 respectivelythe median intake of dietary calcium was lower in vegans compared to omnivores 330  205 vs 682  417 mgday p  0001 however there was no significant correlation between dietary calcium and bmdfurther analysis suggested that whole body bmd but not lumbar spine or femoral neck bmd was positively correlated with the ratio of animal protein to vegetable proteinconclusion these results suggest that although vegans have much lower intakes of dietary calcium and protein than omnivores veganism does not have adverse effect on bone mineral density and does not alter body composition
