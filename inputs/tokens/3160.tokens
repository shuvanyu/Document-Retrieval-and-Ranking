purpose of review to summarize recent findings and current concepts in the beneficial effects of berry consumption on brain function during agingrecent findings berryfruit supplementation has continued to demonstrate efficacy in reversing agerelated cognitive decline in animal studiesin terms of the mechanisms behind the effects of berries on the central nervous system recent studies have demonstrated the bioavailability of berry polyphenols in several animal modelsthese studies have revealed that flavonoids and polyphenols from berries do accumulate in the brain following longterm consumptionfinally several compelling studies have revealed that berries can influence cellsignaling cascades both in vivo and in cell culture systemsthese studies underscore the developing theory that berries and antioxidantrich foods may be acting as more than just oxygen radical neutralizers in the aging central nervous systemsummary antioxidantrich berries consumed in the diet can positively impact learning and memory in the aged animalthis effect on cognition is thought to be due to the direct interaction of berry polyphenols with aging neurons reducing the impact of stressrelated cellular signals and increasing the capacity of neurons to maintain proper functioning during aging
