the present study was designed to evaluate the possible effect of the consumption of blackberry juices bj prepared with water bjw and defatted milk bjm on the plasma antioxidant capacity and the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidantsa significant p  005 increase in the ascorbic acid content in the plasma was observed after intake of both bjshowever no changes were observed in the plasma urate and alphatocopherol levelsan increase on the plasma antioxidant capacity by orac assay was observed only after consumption of bjw but not statistically significantplasma antioxidant capacity had a good positive correlation with ascorbic acid r  093 and a negative correlation with urate level r  079no correlation was observed between antioxidant capacity and total cyanidin or total ellagic acid contentsfurther it was observed that plasma catalase increased following intake of bjsno change was observed on the plasma and erythrocyte cat and glutathione peroxidase activitiesa significant decrease p  005 in the urinary antioxidant capacity between 1 and 4 h after intake of both bjs was observeda good correlation was observed between total antioxidant capacity and urate and total cyanidin levelsthese results suggested association between anthocyanin levels and cat and a good correlation between antioxidant capacity and ascorbic acid in the human plasma after intake of bjsfollowup studies investigating the antioxidant properties and health benefits are necessary to demonstrate the health benefits of polyphenols
