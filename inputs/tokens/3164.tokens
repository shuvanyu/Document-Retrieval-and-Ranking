black rice and its pigment fraction have shown antiatherogenic activities in several animal models but whether their beneficial effects will recur in humans remains unknownthe aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of black rice pigment fraction brf supplementation on selected cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease chdsixty patients with chd aged 4575 years were recruited from the second affiliated hospital of sun yatsen university in guangzhou china and randomly divided into two groupsin the test group the diet was supplemented with 10 grams of brf derived from black rice for 6 months while in the placebo group the diet was supplemented with 10 grams of white rice pigment fraction wrf derived from white riceat baseline plasma antioxidant status and the levels of inflammatory biomarkers and other measured variables were similar between two groupsafter 6 months intervention compared to wrf supplementation brf supplementation greatly enhanced plasma total antioxidant capacity tac p0003 significantly reduce plasma levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule1 svcam1 p003 soluble cd40 ligand scd40l p0002 and high sensitive creactive protein hscrp p0002 in the test groupno significant changes were observed in plasma total superoxide dismutase tsod activity lipids level and carotid artery intimamedia thickness imt between two groupsthese results may suggest that brf could exert cardioprotective effects on patients with chd by improving plasma antioxidant status and inhibiting inflammatory factors
