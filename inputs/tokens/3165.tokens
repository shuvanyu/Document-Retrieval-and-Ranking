using a panel of chemical biochemical and cell assays we determined inhibitory effects of extracts of the pigmented black rice brans on in vitro allergic reactionsethanolwater 70 vv extracts from 5 pigmented brans were found to be more effective than an extract from a nonpigmented rice cultivar in suppressing the release of histamine and betahexosaminidase from basophilic rbl2h3 cells stimulated with both ionophore a23187 and immunoglobulin e igeantigen complexessuppression was also obtained with a23187stimulated rat peritoneal mast cellsthe extent of inhibition of these 2 markers of the immune response was accompanied by an influx of calcium ionsthe inhibition of the immune process by the pigmented brans was confirmed by the observed modulation of the proinflammatory cytokine gene expressions and cytokine release as indicated by the reduction in tumor necrosis factor tnfalpha interleukin il1beta il4 and il6 mrna expressions determined with the reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcrreduction of tnfalpha il1beta and il6 protein release from both the cultured cell line and peritoneal cells was further confirmed by enzymelinked immunoadsorbent assaysrice bran from the lk1361211 cultivar was the most effective inhibitor in all assaysthis particular rice variety merits further evaluation as part of a human diet to ascertain its potential to protect against allergic diseases such as hay fever and asthma
