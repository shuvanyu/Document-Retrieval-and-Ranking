tumor metastasis is the most important cause of cancer death and various treatment strategies have targeted on preventing the occurrence of metastasisanthocyanins are natural colorants belonging to the flavonoid family and are wildly used for their antioxidant propertieshere we provided molecular evidence associated with the antimetastatic effects of peonidin 3glucoside and cyanidin 3glucoside major anthocyanins extracted from black rice oryza sativa l indica by showing a marked inhibition on the invasion and motility of skhep1 cellsthis effect was associated with a reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase mmp9 and urokinasetype plasminogen activator upapeonidin 3glucoside and cyanidin 3glucoside also exerted an inhibitory effect on the dna binding activity and the nuclear translocation of ap1furthermore these compounds also exerted an inhibitory effect of cell invasion on various cancer cells scc4 huh7 and helafinally anthocyanins from o sativa l indica oas were evidenced by its inhibition on the growth of skhep1 cells in vivo
