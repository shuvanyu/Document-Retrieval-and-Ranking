a quantitative human dietary risk assessment was conducted using the glycoalkaloid concentrations measured from tubers of plants defoliated by colorado potato beetles and undefoliated controlthere was a significantly greater production of glycoalkaloids for defoliated plants compared to control plants for both skin and inner tissue of tubersthe dietary risk posed to different human subgroups associated with the consumption of potatoes was estimated for the 50th 95th and 999th percentile us national consumption valuesexposures were compared to a toxic threshold of 10mgkg body weightdefoliation by colorado potato beetles increased dietary risk by approximately 48glycoalkaloid concentrations within the inner tissue of tubers including undefoliated controls exceeded the toxic threshold for all human subgroups at less than the 999th percentile of exposure but not the 95th percentile
