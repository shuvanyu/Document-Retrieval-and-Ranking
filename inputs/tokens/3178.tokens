background celiac disease cd is an immunemediated enteropathic condition triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by the ingestion of glutenalthough common in europe cd is thought to be rare in the united states where there are no large epidemiologic studies of its prevalencethe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cd in atrisk and notatrisk groups in the united statesmethods serum antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysial antibodies ema were measuredin emapositive subjects human tissue transglutaminase iga antibodies and cdassociated human leukocyte antigen dq2dq8 haplotypes were determinedintestinal biopsy was recommended and performed whenever possible for all emapositive subjectsa total of 13 145 subjects were screened 4508 firstdegree and 1275 seconddegree relatives of patients with biopsyproven cd 3236 symptomatic patients with either gastrointestinal symptoms or a disorder associated with cd and 4126 notatrisk individualsresults in atrisk groups the prevalence of cd was 122 in firstdegree relatives 139 in seconddegree relatives and 156 in symptomatic patientsthe overall prevalence of cd in notatrisk groups was 1133all the emapositive subjects who underwent intestinal biopsy had lesions consistent with cdconclusions our results suggest that cd occurs frequently not only in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms but also in first and seconddegree relatives and patients with numerous common disorders even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptomsthe prevalence of cd in symptomatic patients and notatrisk subjects was similar to that reported in europeceliac disease appears to be a more common but neglected disorder than has generally been recognized in the united states
