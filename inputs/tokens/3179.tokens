background  aims the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease require smallbowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia marsh iiihowever mucosal damage develops gradually and patients may evince clinical symptoms before histologic changes appearendomysial antibodies are specific in predicting forthcoming villous atrophywe hypothesized that patients with mild enteropathy but positive endomysial antibodies benefit from a glutenfree diet gfd similarly to patients with more severe enteropathymethods smallbowel endoscopy together with clinical evaluations was performed in all together 70 consecutive adults with positive endomysial antibodiesof these 23 had only mild enteropathy marsh iii and they were randomized either to continue on a glutencontaining diet or start a gfdafter 1 year clinical serologic and histologic evaluations were repeateda total of 47 participants had smallbowel mucosal lesions compatible with celiac disease marsh iii and these served as disease controlsresults in the glutencontaining diet group marsh iii the smallbowel mucosal villous architecture deteriorated in all participants and the symptoms and abnormal antibody titers persistedin contrast in the gfd group marsh iii the symptoms were alleviated antibody titers decreased and mucosal inflammation diminished equally to celiac controls marsh iiiwhen the trial was completed all participants chose to continue on a lifelong gfdconclusions patients with endomysial antibodies benefit from a gfd regardless of the degree of enteropathythe diagnostic criteria for celiac disease need reevaluation endomysial antibody positivity without atrophy belongs to the spectrum of genetic gluten intolerance and warrants dietary treatment
