washing is the most practical way to remove pesticide residues in fruits and vegetablestwo commonly used kitchen dishwashing liquids detergents in chinese market were tested for enhanced removal of chlorpyrifos chp and chlorothalonil cht in cherry tomatoes by soaking the cherry tomatoes in the detergent solutionsthe critical micelle concentrations of detergent a and detergent b were about 250 mg l1 and 444 mg l1 respectivelydetergent a had a higher solubilizing ability for pesticides and hence washing effectiveness than detergent bthe apparent solubility of chp increased with increasing detergent concentration while that of cht remained comparatively invariant independent of detergent concentration within the tested rangethe apparent solubility of chp was also consistently higher in solutions of both detergents as compared to chtdue probably to its lower logkow value cht was more readily washed off cherry tomatoes than chpin terms of washing a duration of 1020 min was sufficient for removal of pesticides on cherry tomatoes in distilled water and detergent solutionsthe effectiveness of removing pesticides increased with increasing detergent concentration from 50 mg l1 to 5 g l1 with up to 80 cht and 42 chp removedmultiple washing further increased pesticide removaladding 10 acetic acid to lower ph or increasing washing temperature favored pesticide removal but 10 nacl produced the shielding effect and substantially reduced the effectiveness of detergent a for pesticide removalcopyright  2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
