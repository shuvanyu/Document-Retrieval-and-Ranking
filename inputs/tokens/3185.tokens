context basic and observational studies suggest vitamins e or c may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease cvdhowever few longterm trials have evaluated men at initially low risk of cvd and no previous trial in men has examined vitamin c alone in the prevention of cvdobjective to test whether longterm vitamin e or c supplementation decreases risk of major cardiovascular events among mendesign setting and participants the physicians health study ii phs ii is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled factorial trial of vitamins e and c that began in 1997 and continued until its scheduled completion on august 31 2007we enrolled 14641 us male physicians initially aged 50 years including 754 51 men with prevalent cvd at randomizationintervention individual supplements of 400 iu vitamin e every other day and 500 mg vitamin c dailymain outcome measures a composite endpoint of major cardiovascular events nonfatal myocardial infarction mi nonfatal stroke and cvd deathresults during a mean followup of 80 years there were 1245 confirmed major cardiovascular eventscompared with placebo vitamin e had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events both active and placebo vitamin e groups 109 events per 1000 personyears hazard ratio hr 101 95 confidence interval ci 090113 p086 as well as total mi hr 090 95 ci 075107 p022 total stroke hr 107 95 ci 089129 p045 and cardiovascular mortality hr 107 95 ci 090129 p043there was also no significant effect of vitamin c on major cardiovascular events active and placebo vitamin e groups 108 and 109 events per 1000 personyears respectively hr 099 95 ci 089111 p091 as well as total mi hr 104 95 ci 087124 p065 total stroke hr 089 95 ci 074107 p021 and cardiovascular mortality hr 102 95 ci 085121 p086neither vitamin e hr 107 95 ci 097118 p015 nor vitamin c hr 107 95 ci 097118 p016 had a significant effect on total mortality but vitamin e was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke hr 174 95 ci 104291 p0036conclusions in this large longterm trial of male physicians neither vitamin e nor c supplementation reduced the risk of major cardiovascular eventsthese data provide no support for the use of these supplements for the prevention of cvd in middleaged and older men
