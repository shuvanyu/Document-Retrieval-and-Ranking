annual global aquaculture production has more than tripled within the past 15 years and by 2015 aquaculture is predicted to account for 39 of total global seafood production by weightgiven that lack of adequate nutrition is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease increased food production through aquaculture is a seemingly welcome signhowever as production surges aquaculture facilities increasingly rely on the heavy input of formulated feeds antibiotics antifungals and agrochemicalsthis review summarizes our current knowledge concerning major chemical biological and emerging agents that are employed in modern aquaculture facilities and their potential impacts on public healthfindings from this review indicate that current aquaculture practices can lead to elevated levels of antibiotic residues antibioticresistant bacteria persistent organic pollutants metals parasites and viruses in aquacultured finfish and shellfishspecific populations at risk of exposure to these contaminants include individuals working in aquaculture facilities populations living around these facilities and consumers of aquacultured food productsadditional research is necessary not only to fully understand the human health risks associated with aquacultured fish versus wildcaught fish but also to develop appropriate interventions that could reduce or prevent these risksin order to adequately understand address and prevent these impacts at local national and global scales researchers policy makers governments and aquaculture industries must collaborate and cooperate in exchanging critical information and developing targeted policies that are practical effective and enforceable
