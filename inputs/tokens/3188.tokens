recently we reported on the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and chlorinated pesticides in farmed atlantic salmon salmo salar from maine eastern canada and norway and wild alaskan chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytschain this paper we extend the analysis to polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes in these samplestotal pbde concentrations in the farmed salmon 0414ngg wet weight ww were not significantly different from those in the wild alaskan chinook samples 0412ngg ww nor were significant differences found among regionshowever significant intraregional variations in concentrations of total pbdes and tetrabde 47 were observed in the salmon from the canadian farms p001congener profiles were dominated by bde47 followed by the pentabdes 99 and 100pbde concentrations in the canadian samples were lower than those reported two years earlierremoval of skin resulted in no overall reduction in pbde concentrations in our farmed salmon and in some cases pbde concentrations were higher in skinoff samplespbdes were correlated with lipids only in the skinned samples suggesting that there is greater accumulation and retention of pbdes in muscle lipids than in skinassociated fatin skinon samples modest correlations were observed between concentrations of pbdes and pcbs r2047 and monoortho pcbs r2050 whereas pbdes were not correlated with nonortho pcbs
