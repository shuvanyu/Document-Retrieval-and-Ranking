concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were measured in 136 fish from 14 remote lakes in 8 western us national parkspreserves between 2003 and 2005 and compared to human and wildlife contaminant health thresholdsa sensitive median detection limit 18 pgg wet weight efficient 61 recovery at 8 ngg reproducible 41 rsd and accurate 7  deviation from srm analytical method was developed and validated for these analysesconcentrations of pcbs hexachlorobenzene hexachlorocyclohexanes ddts and chlordanes in western us fish were comparable to or lower than mountain fish recently collected from europe canada and asiadieldrin and pbde concentrations were higher than recent measurements in mountain fish and pacific ocean salmonconcentrations of most contaminants in western us fish were 16 orders of magnitude below calculated recreational fishing contaminant health thresholdshowever contaminant concentrations exceeded subsistence fishing cancer screening values in 8 of 14 lakesaverage contaminant concentrations in fish exceeded wildlife contaminant health thresholds for piscivorous mammals in 5 lakes and piscivorous birds in all 14 lakesthese results indicate that atmospherically deposited organic contaminants can accumulate in high elevation fish reaching concentrations relevant to human and wildlife health
