pesticides are one of the major inputs used for increasing agricultural productivity of cropsthe pesticide residues left to variable extent in the food materials after harvesting are beyond the control of consumer and have deleterious effect on human healththe presence of pesticide residues is a major bottleneck in the international trade of food commoditiesthe localization of pesticides in foods varies with the nature of pesticide molecule type and portion of food material and environmental factorsthe food crops treated with pesticides invariably contain unpredictable amount of these chemicals therefore it becomes imperative to find out some alternatives for decontamination of foodsthe washing with water or soaking in solutions of salt and some chemicals egchlorine chlorine dioxide hydrogen peroxide ozone acetic acid hydroxy peracetic acid iprodione and detergents are reported to be highly effective in reducing the level of pesticidespreparatory steps like peeling trimming etcremove the residues from outer portionsvarious thermal processing treatments like pasteurization blanching boiling cooking steaming canning scrambling etchave been found valuable in degradation of various pesticides depending upon the type of pesticide and length of treatmentpreservation techniques like drying or dehydration and concentration increase the pesticide content many folds due to concentration effectmany other techniques like refining fermentation and curing have been reported to affect the pesticide level in foods to varied extentmilling baking wine making malting and brewing resulted in lowering of pesticide residue level in the end productspost harvest treatments and cold storage have also been found effectivemany of the decontamination techniques bring down the concentration of pesticides below mrlhowever the diminution effect depends upon the initial concentration at the time of harvest substratefood and type of pesticidethere is diversified information available in literature on the effect of preparation processing and subsequent handling and storage of foods on pesticide residues which has been compiled in this article
