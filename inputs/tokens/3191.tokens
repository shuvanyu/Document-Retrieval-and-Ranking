food and nutrition professionals question whether supplementsourced nutrients appear to be equivalent to those derived from natural food sourceswe compared the nutritional availability of docosahexaenoic acid dha from algaloil capsules to that from assayed cooked salmon in 32 healthy men and women ages 20 to 65 years in a randomized openlabel parallelgroup studyin this 2week study comparing 600 mg dhaday from algaloil capsules to that from assayed portions of cooked salmon mean change from baseline in plasma phospholipids and erythrocyte dha levels was analyzed and dha levels were compared by students t testsin posthoc analyses to determine bioequivalence leastsquares mean ratios of percent change from baseline in plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte dha levels were compareddha levels increased by approximately 80 in plasma phospholipids and by approximately 25 in erythrocytes in both groupschanges in dha levels in plasma phospholipids and erythrocytes were similar between groupsas measured by delivery of dha to both plasma and erythrocytes fish and algaloil capsules were equivalentboth regimens were generally welltoleratedthese results indicate that algaloil dha capsules and cooked salmon appear to be bioequivalent in providing dha to plasma and red blood cells and accordingly that algaloil dha capsules represent a safe and convenient source of nonfishderived dha
