in the late 1960s the first scientific studies on contamination in antarctica demonstrated the presence of pollutants in antarctic ecosystemsmany persistent organic pollutants pops are transported globally from the areas in which they are produced and released into the environment in remote areas including antarcticahere we report results obtained concerning the accumulation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes mono and nonorthopolychlorobiphenyls pcbs polychlorodibenzodioxins pcdds and polychlorodibenzofurans pcdfs in the tissues of two species of antarctic fish chionodraco hamatus and trematomus bernacchiithe 2378tcdd toxic equivalents teqs were also calculated to evaluate the potential risk of these compounds for the two speciesin general pop levels were higher in the tissues of t bernacchii than in c hamatus and the highest concentrations were found in the liver of both speciesthe pbde levels varied from 1605 pg g1 wet wt in c hamatus muscle to 7899 pg g1 wet wt in t bernacchii liver and were lower than the levels of pcbspcbs were the main organochlorine compounds detected and their concentrations ranged from 03 ng g1 wet wt in c hamatus muscle to 151 ng g1 wet wt in t bernacchii liverteq concentrations resulted higher in c hamatus than in t bernacchii and were due mainly to pcddsthe presence of pbdes and organochlorine pollutants in the tissues of antarctic organisms confirms their global transport and distribution
