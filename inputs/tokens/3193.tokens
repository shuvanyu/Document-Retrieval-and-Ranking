objective to test the effect of four polychlorinated biphenyl congeners pcb77 pcb105 pcb 153 and pcb 180 on expression of three adhesion markers tgfβ1 vegf and type i collagen in normal human peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts design cell culture study settings university research laboratory patients primary cultures of normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts were established from three patientsinterventions fibroblasts were treated with pcb77 pcb105 pcb153 or pcb180 20 ppm for 24 hourstotal rna was extracted from each treatment and subjected to realtime rtpcrmain outcome and measures mrna levels of type i collagen vegf and tgfβ1results normal human peritoneal fibroblasts expressed type i collagen vegf and tgfβ1exposure of normal human fibroblasts to pcb77 pcb105 pcb153 or pcb180 did not affect mrna levels of βactin the house keeping gene used to normalized rna levels for the realtime rtpcr nor did it affect cell viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusionpcb treatments compared to control resulted in no significant change for tgfβ1 or vegf mrna levels in normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblastsin marked contrast type i collagen mrna levels were markedly increased in response to the brief 24 hrs exposure to each pcb treatment each p00001 in both cell typesconclusion the finding that pcb77 pcb105 pcb153 or pcb180 increased the expression of type i collagen in human normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts is the first demonstration of involvement of organochlorines in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosisthis may implicate organochlorine exposure as an etiologic factor in a wide variety of previously unlinked human ailments characterized by fibrosis
