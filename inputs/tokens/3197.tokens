the association of 11 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs with hypertension was investigated using the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes 19992002the unweighted number of participants assessed for hypertension ranged from 2074 to 2556 depending on the chemicals being analyzedin unadjusted logistic regressions all 11 pcbs were associated with hypertensionafter adjustment for age gender race smoking status body mass index exercise total cholesterol and family history of coronary heart disease seven of the 11 pcbs pcbs 126 74 118 99 138158 170 and 187 were significantly associated with hypertensionthe strongest adjusted associations with hypertension were found for dioxinlike pcbs 126 and 118pcb 126591 pgg lipid adjusted had an odds ratio of 245 95 ci 148404 compared to pcb 126or261 pgg lipid adjustedpcb 118275 ngg lipid adjusted had an odds ratio of 230 95 ci 129408 compared to pcb 118or125 ngg lipid adjustedmoreover participants with one or more elevated pcbs had an odds ratio of 184 95 ci 125270 compared to no pcbs elevated in an adjusted logistic regressionthe prevalence of one or more elevated pcbs was 2276 or 32 million of 142 million persons or20 years old in the noninstitutionalized us populationwe hypothesize that association of seven pcbs with hypertension indicates elevated pcbs are a risk factor for hypertensionwhat clinicians can do given the results of this study is limited unless the appropriate laboratory methods can be made more widely available for testing patients
