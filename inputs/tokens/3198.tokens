fish and seal oil dietary supplements marketed to be rich in omega3 fatty acids are frequently consumed by canadianssamples of these supplements n  30 were collected in vancouver canada between 2005 and 2007all oil supplements were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and organochlorine insecticides ocs and each sample was found to contain detectable residuesthe highest sigmapcb and sigmaddt 111trichlorodi4chlorophenylethane concentrations 10400 ngg and 3310 ngg respectively were found in a shark oil sample while lowest levels were found in supplements prepared using mixed fish oils anchovy mackerel and sardine 0711 ng sigmapcbg and 0189 ng sigmaddtgmean sigmapcb concentrations in oil supplements were 345 242 251 953 120 5260 321 and 519 ngg in unidentified fish mixed fish containing no salmon mixed fish with salmon salmon vegetable with mixed fish shark menhaden n  1 and seal n  1 respectivelymaximum concentrations of the other ocs were generally observed in the seal oilthe hexachlorinated pcb congeners were the dominant contributors to sigmapcb levels while sigmaddt was the greatest contributor to organochlorine levelsintake estimates were made using maximum dosages on manufacturers labels and results varied widely due to the large difference in residue concentrations obtainedaverage sigmapcb and sigmaddt intakes were calculated to be 736  2840 ngd and 304  948 ngd respectively
