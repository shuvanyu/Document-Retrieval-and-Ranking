methyl mercury is a developmental neurotoxicantexposure results principally from consumption by pregnant women of seafood contaminated by mercury from anthropogenic 70 and natural 30 sourcesthroughout the 1990s the us environmental protection agency epa made steady progress in reducing mercury emissions from anthropogenic sources especially from power plants which account for 41 of anthropogenic emissionshowever the us epa recently proposed to slow this progress citing high costs of pollution abatementto put into perspective the costs of controlling emissions from american power plants we have estimated the economic costs of methyl mercury toxicity attributable to mercury from these plantswe used an environmentally attributable fraction model and limited our analysis to the neurodevelopmental impactsspecifically loss of intelligenceusing national blood mercury prevalence data from the centers for disease control and prevention we found that between 316588 and 637233 children each year have cord blood mercury levels  58 Î¼gl a level associated with loss of iqthe resulting loss of intelligence causes diminished economic productivity that persists over the entire lifetime of these childrenthis lost productivity is the major cost of methyl mercury toxicity and it amounts to 87 billion annually range 22438 billion all costs are in 2000 usof this total 13 billion range 0165 billion each year is attributable to mercury emissions from american power plantsthis significant toll threatens the economic health and security of the united states and should be considered in the debate on mercury pollution controls
