objective to evaluate the role of the environmental estrogens polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and phthalate esters pes as potential environmental hazards in the deterioration of semen parameters in infertile men without an obvious etiologydesign randomized controlled studysetting tertiary care referral infertility clinic and academic research centerpatients twentyone infertile men with sperm counts 20 millionml andor rapid progressive motility 25 andor 30 normal forms without evidence of an obvious etiology and 32 control men with normal semen analyses and evidence of conceptionsemen and blood samples were obtained as part of the treatment protocolmain outcome measures evaluation of semen parameters such as ejaculate volume sperm count motility morphology vitality osmoregulatory capacity sperm chromatin stability and sperm nuclear dna integrityresults pcbs were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile men but not in controls and the concentration of pes was significantly higher in infertile men compared with controlsejaculate volume sperm count progressive motility normal morphology and fertilizing capacity were significantly lower in infertile men compared with controlsthe highest average pcb and pe concentrations were found in urban fish eaters followed by rural fish eaters urban vegetarians and rural vegetariansthe total motile sperm counts in infertile men were inversely proportional to their xenoestrogen concentrations and were significantly lower than those in the respective controlsconclusions pcbs and pes may be instrumental in the deterioration of semen quality in infertile men without an obvious etiology
