background to look at possible longterm risks from anabolic steroids and other xenobiotics in beef we examined mens semen quality in relation to their mothers selfreported beef consumption during pregnancymethods the study was carried out in five us cities between 1999 and 2005we used regression analyses to examine semen parameters in 387 partners of pregnant women in relation to the amount of beef their mothers reported eating while pregnantmothers beef consumption was also analysed in relation to the sons history of previous subfertilityresults sperm concentration was inversely related to mothers beef meals per week p  0041in sons of high beef consumers 7 beef mealsweek sperm concentration was 243 lower p  0014 and the proportion of men with sperm concentration below 20 x 106ml was three times higher 177 versus 57 p  0002 than in men whose mothers ate less beefa history of previous subfertility was also more frequent among sons of high beef consumers p  0015sperm concentration was not significantly related to mothers consumption of other meat or to the mans consumption of any meatconclusions these data suggest that maternal beef consumption and possibly xenobiotics in beef may alter a mans testicular development in utero and adversely affect his reproductive capacity
