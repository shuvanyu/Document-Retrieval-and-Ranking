research on infectious agents as a possible cause of schizophrenia has become prominent in the past decadetoxoplasma gondii has emerged as a prime candidate for a variety of reasons i many studies have reported that individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls have a higher prevalence of antibodies to t gondii ii some individuals with adult toxoplasmosis develop psychotic symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia iii epidemiologically there are many similarities between toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia iv antipsychotic drugs known to be effective in schizophrenia also inhibit some parasites including t gondii v toxoplasma has been shown to induce elevated levels of dopamine in experimentally infected animals elevated dopamine is commonly seen in individuals with schizophrenia and vi studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls have had greater exposure to cats in childhooda number of questions remain concerning a role for toxoplasma in the aetiology of schizophrenia including the roles of strain variation the timing and source of infection and the role of host genes in determining disease susceptibilitythe establishment of a firm association between toxoplasma and the aetiology of schizophrenia and related disorders would represent a major breakthrough in the understanding of these disorders and would lead to novel methods for their treatment and prevention
