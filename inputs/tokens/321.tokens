we assessed organophosphorus op pesticide exposure from diet by biological monitoring among seattle washington preschool childrenparents kept food diaries for 3 days before urine collection and they distinguished organic and conventional foods based on label informationchildren were then classified as having consumed either organic or conventional diets based on analysis of the diary dataresidential pesticide use was also recorded for each homewe collected 24hr urine samples from 18 children with organic diets and 21 children with conventional diets and analyzed them for five op pesticide metaboliteswe found significantly higher median concentrations of total dimethyl alkylphosphate metabolites than total diethyl alkylphosphate metabolites 006 and 002 micro moll respectively p  00001the median total dimethyl metabolite concentration was approximately six times higher for children with conventional diets than for children with organic diets 017 and 003 micro moll p  00003 mean concentrations differed by a factor of nine 034 and 004 micro mollwe calculated dose estimates from urinary dimethyl metabolites and from agricultural pesticide use data assuming that all exposure came from a single pesticidethe dose estimates suggest that consumption of organic fruits vegetables and juice can reduce childrens exposure levels from above to below the us environmental protection agencys current guidelines thereby shifting exposures from a range of uncertain risk to a range of negligible riskconsumption of organic produce appears to provide a relatively simple way for parents to reduce their childrens exposure to op pesticides
