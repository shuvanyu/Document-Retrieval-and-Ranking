little information is available on the presence of viable toxoplasma gondii in tissues of lambs worldwidethe prevalence of t gondii was determined in 383 lambs 1 year old from maryland virginia and west virginia usahearts of 383 lambs were obtained from a slaughter house on the day of killingblood removed from each heart was tested for antibodies to t gondii by using the modified agglutination test matsera were first screened using 125 150 1 100 and 1200 dilutions and hearts were selected for bioassay for t gondiiantibodies mat 125 or higher to t gondii were found in 104 271 of 383 lambshearts of 68 seropositive lambs were used for isolation of viable t gondii by bioassay in cats mice or bothfor bioassays in cats the entire myocardium or 500g was chopped and fed to cats one cat per heart and faeces of the recipient cats were examined for shedding of t gondii oocystsfor bioassays in mice 50g of the myocardium was digested in an acid pepsin solution and the digest inoculated into mice the recipient mice were examined for t gondii infectionin total 53 isolates of t gondii were obtained from 68 seropositive lambsgenotyping of the 53 t gondii isolates using 10 pcrrestriction fragment length polymorphism markers sag1 sag2 sag3 btub gra6 c228 c292 l358 pk1 and apico revealed 57 strains with 15 genotypesfour lambs had infections with two t gondii genotypestwentysix 456 strains belong to the clonal type ii lineage these strains can be further divided into two groups based on alleles at locus apicoeight 157 strains belong to the type iii lineagethe remaining 22 strains were divided into 11 atypical genotypesthese results indicate high parasite prevalence and high genetic diversity of t gondii in lambs which has important implications in public healthwe believe this is the first indepth genetic analysis of t gondii isolates from sheep in the usa
