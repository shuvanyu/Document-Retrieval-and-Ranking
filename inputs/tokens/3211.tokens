sarcocystis sppare parasitic protists acquired when undercooked cystladen meat is consumedwhile both sarcocystis hominis and s cruzi encyst in beef only s hominis is pathogenic to humansin this study we used histological methods and novel molecular techniques to determine the regional prevalence and identity of sarcocystis sppin retail beefof 110 samples 60 supported amplification of parasite rrna by pcrall 41 sequenced representatives were identified as s cruzito compare detection methods 48 samples were then examined in parallel by histology and pcr and 16 and 26 samples respectively were positivefive samples positive by initial histologic sections were not amplified by pcrfifteen pcrpositive samples did not contain sarcocysts on initial histologic section but additional sections from these samples revealed sarcocysts in an additional 12 sampleswhen combined histology with additional sections and pcr detected 31 positive specimens of the 48 total specimenswe found no evidence of human pathogen s hominis and confirm that cattle pathogen s cruzi is highly prevalent in this regional samplepcr assays may increase the detection sensitivity of sarcocystis sppand contribute diagnostic precision
