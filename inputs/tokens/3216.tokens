background vibrio species are a rare cause of necrotizing softtissue infections and primary septicemia which are likely to occur in patients with hepatic disease diabetes adrenal insufficiency and immunocompromised conditionsthese organisms thrive in warm seawater and are often present in raw oysters shellfish and other seafoodthis study examined fulminating clinical characteristics of vibrio vulnificus and vibrio cholerae nono1 softtissue infections and identified outcome predictorsmaterials thirty patients with necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis caused by vibrio species were retrospectively reviewedtwentyeight patients had a history of contact with seawater or raw seafoodeight patients had hepatic disease such as hepatitis or liver cirrhosis and seven patients had diabetes mellitusnine patients had hepatic dysfunction combined with diabetes mellitusmicrobiology laboratory culture studies confirmed v vulnificus in 23 patients and v cholerae nono1 in seven patientsresults surgical debridement or immediate limb amputation was initially performed in all patients with necrotizing softtissue infectionseleven patients 37 died within several days of admission and 19 survivedthe mortality of v cholerae nono1 group 57 is higher than that of the v vulnificus group 30a significantly higher mortality rate was noted in patients with initial presentations of a systolic blood pressure of  or 90 mm hg leukopenia decreased platelet counts and a combination of hepatic dysfunction and diabetes mellitusconclusions vibrio necrotizing softtissue infections should be suspected in patients with appropriate clinical findings and history of contact with seawater or seafoodv cholerae nono1 may cause bacteremia more often than v vulnificus in patients with liver cirrhosisearly fasciotomy and culturedirected antimicrobial therapy are aggressively recommended in patients with hypotensive shock leukopenia high band forms of white blood cells decreased platelet counts severe hypoalbuminemia and underlying chronic illness such as hepatic dysfunction and diabetes mellitus
