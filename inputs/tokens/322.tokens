the cookinginduced changes in the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes hexachlorobenzene hcb and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in various foodstuffs were investigatedfoods included fish sardine hake and tuna meat veal steak loin of pork breast and thigh of chicken and steak and rib of lamb string bean potato rice and olive oilfor each food item raw and cooked fried grilled roasted boiled samples were analyzedthere were some variations in the concentrations of pbdes before and after cookinghowever they depended not only on the cooking process but mainly on the specific food itemthe highest hcb concentrations were found in sardine being lower in cooked samplesall cooking processes enhanced hcb levels in hake while very scarce differences could be noted in tuna raw and cookedin general terms the highest pah concentrations were found after frying by being the values especially notable in fish excepting hake where the highest total pah levels corresponded to roasted samplesthe results of this study show that in general cooking processes are only of a limited value as a means of reducing pbde hcb and pah concentrations in food
