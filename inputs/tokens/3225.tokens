roasting is a crucial step for the production of coffee as it enables the development of color aroma and flavor which are essential for the characterization of the coffee qualityat the same time roasting may lead to the formation of not desirable compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahsin this paper we report a method for pahs determination in coffee brew based on saponification and liquidliquid extraction with small volumes of hexane with exclusion of further processes of purification since we analyze the extract by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detectors in the single ion monitoring mode simthe total concentration of the 28 compounds investigated expressed as the sum of concentrations sigmapah in coffee brew varies from 052 to 18 microglcarcinogenic pahs expressed as bapeq ranged from 0008 to 0060 microglthe results indicate that coffee contributes with very insignificant quantities to the daily human intake of carcinogenic pahsthe values of calculated isomeric ratios confirm that the pahs identified in most of the coffee samples originate from high temperature processes
