context organophosphate op pesticides are neurotoxic at high dosesfew studies have examined whether chronic exposure at lower levels could adversely affect childrens cognitive developmentobjective we examined associations between prenatal and postnatal exposure to op pesticides and cognitive abilities in schoolage childrenmethods we conducted a birth cohort study center for the health assessment of mothers and children of salinas study among predominantly latino farmworker families from an agricultural community in californiawe assessed exposure to op pesticides by measuring dialkyl phosphate dap metabolites in urine collected during pregnancy and from children at 6 months and 1 2 35 and 5 years of agewe administered the wechsler intelligence scale for children 4th edition to 329 children 7 years of ageanalyses were adjusted for maternal education and intelligence home observation for measurement of the environment score and language of cognitive assessmentresults urinary dap concentrations measured during the first and second half of pregnancy had similar relations to cognitive scores so we used the average of concentrations measured during pregnancy in further analysesaveraged maternal dap concentrations were associated with poorer scores for working memory processing speed verbal comprehension perceptual reasoning and fullscale intelligence quotient iqchildren in the highest quintile of maternal dap concentrations had an average deficit of 70 iq points compared with those in the lowest quintilehowever childrens urinary dap concentrations were not consistently associated with cognitive scoresconclusions prenatal but not postnatal urinary dap concentrations were associated with poorer intellectual development in 7yearold childrenmaternal urinary dap concentrations in the present study were higher but nonetheless within the range of levels measured in the general us population
