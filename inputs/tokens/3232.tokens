context high intakes of red or processed meat may increase risk of mortalityobjective determine the relations of red white and processed meat intakes to risk for total and causespecific mortalitydesign setting and participants the nihaarp diet and health study cohort of half a million people aged 5071 years at baselinemeat intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baselinecox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals cis within quintiles of meat intakethe covariates included in the models were age education marital status family history of cancer yesno cancer mortality only race body mass index 31level smoking history physical activity energy intake alcohol intake vitamin supplement use fruit consumption vegetable consumption and menopausal hormone therapy among womenmain outcome measure total mortality deaths due to cancer cvd accidents and other causesresults there were 47976 male deaths and 23276 female deaths during 10 years of followupmen and women in the highest versus lowest quintile of red hr 131 95 ci 127135 hr 136 95 ci 130143 respectively and processed meat intake hr 116 95 ci 112120 hr 125 95 120131 respectively had elevated risks for overall mortalityregarding causespecific mortality men and women had elevated risks for cancer mortality for red hr 122 95 ci 116129 hr 120 95 ci 112130 respectively and processed meats hr 112 95 ci 106119 hr 111 95 ci 104119 respectivelyfurthermore cvd risk was elevated for men and women in the highest quintile of red hr 127 95 ci 120135 hr 150 95 ci 137165 respectively and processed meat hr 109 95 ci 103115 hr 138 95 ci 126151 respectivelywhen comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of white meat intake there was an inverse association for total mortality and cancer mortality as well as all other deaths for both men and womenconclusion red and processed meat intakes were associated with modest increases in total mortality cancer mortality and cvd mortality
