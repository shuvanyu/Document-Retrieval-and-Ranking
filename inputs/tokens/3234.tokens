background lowfat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with weight loss increased insulin sensitivity and improved cardiovascular healthobjective we compared the effects of a lowfat vegan diet and conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia weight and plasma lipidsdesign freeliving individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a lowfat vegan diet n  49 or a diet following 2003 american diabetes association guidelines conventional n  50 for 74 wkglycated hemoglobin hb a1c and plasma lipids were assessed at weeks 0 11 22 35 48 61 and 74weight was measured at weeks 0 22 and 74results weight loss was significant within each diet group but not significantly different between groups 44 kg in the vegan group and 30 kg in the conventional diet group p  025 and related significantly to hb a1c changes r  050 p  0001hb a1c changes from baseline to 74 wk or last available values were 034 and 014 for vegan and conventional diets respectively p  043hb a1c changes from baseline to last available value or last value before any medication adjustment were 040 and 001 for vegan and conventional diets respectively p  003in analyses before alterations in lipidlowering medications total cholesterol decreased by 204 and 68 mgdl in the vegan and conventional diet groups respectively p  001 ldl cholesterol decreased by 135 and 34 mgdl in the vegan and conventional groups respectively p  003conclusions both diets were associated with sustained reductions in weight and plasma lipid concentrationsin an analysis controlling for medication changes a lowfat vegan diet appeared to improve glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet recommendationswhether the observed differences provide clinical benefit for the macro or microvascular complications of diabetes remains to be establishedthis trial was registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct00276939
