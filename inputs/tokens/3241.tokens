background the effect of salt reduction on vascular function assessed by brachial artery flowmediated dilatation fmd is unknownobjective our aim was to compare the effects of a lowsalt ls 50 mmol nad diet with those of a usualsalt us 150 mmol nad diet on fmddesign this was a randomized crossover design in which 29 overweight and obese normotensive men and women followed an ls diet and a us diet for 2 wkboth diets had similar potassium and saturated fat contents and were designed to ensure weight stabilityafter each intervention fmd pulse wave velocity augmentation index and blood pressure were measuredresults fmd was significantly greater p  0001 with the ls diet 489  242 than with the us diet 337  210 systolic blood pressure was significantly p  002 lower with the ls diet 112  11 mm hg than with the us diet 117  13 mm hg and 24h sodium excretion was significantly lower p  00001 with the ls diet 641  413 mmol than with the us diet 1563  567 mmolthere was no correlation between change in fmd and change in 24h sodium excretion or change in blood pressureno significant changes in augmentation index or pulse wave velocity were observedconclusions salt reduction improves endotheliumdependant vasodilation in normotensive subjects independently of the changes in measured resting clinic blood pressurethese findings suggest additional cardioprotective effects of salt reduction beyond blood pressure reductionthe trial is registered with the australian and new zealand clinical trials registry unique identifier anzctr12607000381482 httpwwwanzctrorgautrial_viewaspxid82159
