animal studies suggest that diets low in calories and rich in unsaturated fatty acids ufa are beneficial for cognitive function in agehere we tested in a prospective interventional design whether the same effects can be induced in humansfifty healthy normal to overweight elderly subjects 29 females mean age 605 years mean body mass index 28 kgm2 were stratified into 3 groups i caloric restriction 30 reduction ii relative increased intake of ufas 20 increase unchanged total fat and iii controlbefore and after 3 months of intervention memory performance was assessed under standardized conditionswe found a significant increase in verbal memory scores after caloric restriction mean increase 20 p  0001 which was correlated with decreases in fasting plasma levels of insulin and high sensitive creactive protein most pronounced in subjects with best adherence to the diet all r values  08 all p values 005levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor remained unchangedno significant memory changes were observed in the other 2 groupsthis interventional trial demonstrates beneficial effects of caloric restriction on memory performance in healthy elderly subjectsmechanisms underlying this improvement might include higher synaptic plasticity and stimulation of neurofacilitatory pathways in the brain because of improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammatory activityour study may help to generate novel prevention strategies to maintain cognitive functions into old age
