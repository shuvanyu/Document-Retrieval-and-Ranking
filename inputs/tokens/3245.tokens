curcumin has been reported to have the potential to prevent obesity as well as cancersthe downstream targets regulated by ampactivated protein kinase ampk for inhibiting adipocyte differentiation or cancer cell proliferation of curcumin were investigatedthe activation of ampk by curcumin was crucial for the inhibition of differentiation or growth in both adipocytes and cancer cellsstimulation of ampk by curcumin resulted in the downregulation of ppar peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorgamma in 3t3l1 adipocytes and the decrease in cox2 in mcf7 cellsapplication of a synthetic ampk activator also supported the evidence that ampk acts as an upstream signal of ppargamma in 3t3l1 adipocytesin cancer cells ampk was found to act as a regulator of erk12 p38 and cox2regulation of ampk and its downstream targets such as ppargamma mapkinases and cox2 by curcumin appears to be important in controlling adipocytes and cancerous cells
