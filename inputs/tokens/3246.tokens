curcumin cur a component of turmeric curcuma longa has been reported to exhibit antimetastatic activities but the mechanisms remain unclearother curcuminoids present in turmeric demethoxycurcumin dmc and bisdemethoxycurcumin bdmc have not been investigated whether they exhibit antimetastatic activity to the same extent as curcuminthe regulation of matrix metalloproteinases mmps and urokinase plasminogen activator upa play important role in cancer cell invasion by cleavage of extracellular matrix ecmin this line we comparatively examined the influence of cur dmc and bdmc on the expressions of upa mmp2 mmp9 membrane type 1 mmp mt1mmp tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases timp2 and in vitro invasiveness of human fibrosarcoma cellsthe results indicate that the differential potency for inhibition of cancer cell invasion was bdmc or dmccur whereas the cell migration was not affectedzymography analysis exhibited that curcumin dmc and bdmc significantly decreased upa activemmp2 and mmp9 but not prommp2 secretion from the cells in a dosedependent manner in which bdmc and dmc show higher potency than curcuminthe suppression of active mmp2 level correlated with inhibition of mt1mmp and timp2 protein levels involved in prommp2 activationimportantly bdmc and dmc at 10 microm reduced mt1mmp and timp2 protein expression but curcumin slightly reduced only mt1mmp but not timp2in addition three forms of curcuminoids significantly inhibited collagenase mmp2 and mmp9 but not upa activityin summary these data demonstrated that dmc and bdmc show higher antimetastasis potency than curcumin by the differentially downregulation of ecm degradation enzymes
