background high oxalate intake resulting from consuming supplemental doses of cinnamon and turmeric may increase risk of hyperoxaluria a significant risk factor for urolithiasisobjective this study assessed urinary oxalate excretion from supplemental doses of cinnamon and turmeric as well as changes in fasting plasma glucose cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrationsdesign eleven healthy subjects aged 2138 y participated in an 8wk randomly assigned crossover study that involved the ingestion of supplemental doses of cinnamon and turmeric for 4wk periods that provided 55 mg oxalatedoxalate load tests which entailed the ingestion of a 63mg dose of oxalate from the test spices were performed after each 4wk experimental period and at the study onset with water only control treatmentfasting plasma glucose and lipid concentrations were also assessed at these time pointsresults compared with the cinnamon and control treatments turmeric ingestion led to a significantly higher urinary oxalate excretion during the oxalate load teststhere were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose or lipids in conjunction with the 4wk periods of either cinnamon or turmeric supplementationconclusions the percentage of oxalate that was water soluble differed markedly between cinnamon 6 and turmeric 91 which appeared to be the primary cause of the greater urinary oxalate excretionoxalate absorption from turmericthe consumption of supplemental doses of turmeric but not cinnamon can significantly increase urinary oxalate levels thereby increasing risk of kidney stone formation in susceptible individuals
