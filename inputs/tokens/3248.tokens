we examine the possible evidence that the phytochemical curcumin may overcome resistance to hormonal and cytotoxic agents in breast cancerwe present our observations on mcf7r a multidrugresistant mdr variant of the mcf7 breast cancer cell linein contrast to mcf7 mcf7r lacks aromatase and estrogen receptor alpha eralpha and overexpresses the multidrug transporter abcb1 and the products of different genes implicated in cell proliferation and survival like ciap1 naip survivin and cox2nevertheless in cytotoxicity and cell death induction assays we found that the antitumor activity of curcumin is substantial both in mcf7 and in mcf7rwe elaborated the diketone system of curcumin into different analogues the benzyloxime and the isoxazole and pyrazole heterocycles showed remarkable increases in the antitumor potency both in the parental and in the mdr mcf7 cellsfurthermore curcumin or more potently the isoxazole analogue produced early reductions in the amounts of relevant gene transcripts that were diverse ie they were relative to bcl2 and bclxl in mcf7 and the inhibitory of apoptosis proteins and cox2 in mcf7r in the two cell linesthus the two compounds exhibited the remarkable property of being able to modify their molecular activities according to the distinct characteristics of the parental and mdr cellswe discuss also how curcumin may 1 exert antitumor effects in breast cancer through erdependent and erindependent mechanisms and 2 act as a drug transportermediated mdr reversal agentoverall the structure of curcumin may represent the basis for the development of new effective anticancer agents in hormoneindependent mdr breast cancer
