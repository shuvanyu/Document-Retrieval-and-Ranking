backgroundaims cell culture studies suggest that phytoestrogens abundant in soy products such as tempe and tofu could protect against cognitive declineparadoxically the honolulu asia aging study reported an increased risk for cognitive impairment and other dementia markers with high tofu soybean curd intakemethods a crosssectional study was carried out in 2 rural sites borobudur and sumedang and 1 urban site jakarta among mainly javanese and sundanese elderly n  719 5298 years of agememory was measured using a word learning test sensitive to dementia and soy consumption was assessed using food frequency questionnaire itemsresults high tofu consumption was associated with worse memory beta  018 p  001 95 ci  034 to 006 while high tempe consumption a fermented whole soybean product was independently related to better memory beta  012 p  005 95 ci  000028 particularly in participants over 68 years of agefruit consumption also had an independent positive associationthe analyses were controlled for age sex education site and intake of other foodsconclusion the results for tofu consumption as a risk factor for low memory function may tie in with the honolulu asia aging study datait is unclear whether these negative associations could be attributed to potential toxins or to its phytoestrogen levelsestrogen through which receptors phytoestrogens can exert effects was found to increase dementia risk in women over 65 years of agetempe contains high levels of phytoestrogens but due to fermentation also exhibits high folate levels which may exert protective effectsfuture studies should validate these findings and investigate potential mechanismscopyright 2008 s karger ag basel
