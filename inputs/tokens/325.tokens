background conventional food production commonly uses organophosphate op pesticides which can have negative health effects while organic food is deemed healthier because it is produced without these pesticidesstudies suggest that organic food consumption may significantly reduce op pesticide exposure in children who have relatively higher pesticide exposure than adults due to their different diets body weight behaviour and less efficient metabolismobjectives a prospective randomised crossover study was conducted to determine if an organic food diet reduces organophosphate exposure in adultsmethods thirteen participants were randomly allocated to consume a diet of at least 80 organic or conventional food for 7 days and then crossed over to the alternate dieturinary levels of six dialkylphosphate metabolites were analysed in firstmorning voids collected on day 8 of each phase using gcmsms with detection limits of 011051 Î¼glresults the mean total dap results in the organic phase were 89 lower than in the conventional phase m0032 sd0038 and 0294 sd0435 respectively p0013for total dimethyl daps there was a 96 reduction m0011 sd0023 and 0252 sd0403 respectively p0005mean total diethyl dap levels in the organic phase were half those of the conventional phase m0021 sd0020 and 0042 sd0038 respectively yet the wide variability and small sample size meant the difference was not statistically significantconclusions the consumption of an organic diet for one week significantly reduced op pesticide exposure in adultslarger scale studies in different populations are required to confirm these findings and investigate their clinical relevancecopyright  2014 elsevier inc all rights reserved
