this study investigated the effect of coconut flakes on serum cholesterol levels of humans with moderately raised serum cholesterol in 21 subjectsthe serum total cholesterol of subjects differed and ranged from 259 to 283 mgdlthe study was conducted in a doubleblind randomized crossover design on a 14week period consisting of four 2week experimental periods with each experimental period separated by a 2week washout periodthe test foods were as follows corn flakes as the control food oat bran flakes as the reference food and corn flakes with 15 and 25 dietary fiber from coconut flakes made from coconut flour productionresults showed a significant percent reduction in serum total and lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol in mgdl for all test foods except for corn flakes as follows oat bran flakes 84  14 and 88  60 respectively 15 coconut flakes 69  11 and 110  40 respectively and 25 coconut flakes 108  13 and 92  54 respectivelyserum triglycerides were significantly reduced for all test foods corn flakes 145  63 oat bran flakes 227  29 15 coconut flakes 193  57 and 25 coconut flakes 218  60only 60 of the subjects were considered for serum triglycerides reduction serum triglycerides 170 mgdlin conclusion both 15 and 25 coconut flakes reduced serum total and ldl cholesterol and serum triglycerides of humans with moderately raised serum cholesterol levelscoconut flour is a good source of both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber and both types of fiber may have significant role in the reduction of the above lipid biomarkerto our knowledge this is the first study conducted to show a relationship between dietary fiber from a coconut byproduct and a lipid biomarkerresults from this study serves as a good basis in the development of coconut flakesflour as a functional food justifying the increased production of coconut and coconut byproducts
