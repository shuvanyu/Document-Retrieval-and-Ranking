introduction endothelial dysfunction is known to occur in patients with coronary artery diseaseflowmediated dilation of the brachial artery using doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive technique for the assessment of endothelial functionthe objective of the study was to use the above method to evaluate the pathophysiology of highfat hf intake on endothelial function in a local populationa popular local dish nasilemak a source of high saturated fat content from coconut milk was chosen to represent a local highfat meal lhfin addition the effects of a western highfat whf mcdonalds meal and a lowfat lf meal control on endothelial function were studiedmaterials and methods the study population consisted of 10 healthy male nonsmoker mean age 22  2 years with normal body mass index normal fasting sugar and lipid profilesnitric oxide dependent flowmediated dilation and nitric oxide independent gtn dilation was assessed by doppler flow in the brachial artery before and 4 hours after each meal on separate occasions by 2 experienced sonographers blinded to the type of mealsresults the baseline brachial artery size baseline vessel flow and increase in flow after cuff deflation were similar for each of the six arterial studiesin response to reactive hyperaemia after cuff deflation the endotheliumdependent dilation was significantly different between the mealsthere was a marked decrease in endotheliumdependent dilation after the whf meal compared to the lf meal 86  22 vs 08  11 p  0006there was also a marked decrease in endotheliumdependent dilation after the lhf meal compared to the lf meal 77  21 vs 08  11 p  0001when comparing between the two hf meals the change in endotheliumdependent dilation was not significant 77 vs 86 p  0678gtninduced dilation was not significantly different before and after the lf whf or lhf 01  05 vs 02  09 vs 13  05 p  0094conclusion the results suggest that in a local population impairment of endothelial function is a possible mechanism in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis from hf intake beyond just affecting lipid levelsthis effect is observed after both a lhf and a whf meal intakethis technique to study endothelial function may be a useful noninvasive screening tool in the study of other hf diet choices and provides further information for the education of the influence of dietary choices on atherosclerosis
