objective the aim of this present study was to determine plasma levels of lathosterol lipids lipoproteins and apolipoproteins during diets rich in butter coconut fat and safflower oildesign the study consisted of sequential six week periods of diets rich in butter coconut fat then safflower oil and measurements were made at baseline and at week 4 in each diet periodsubjects fortyone healthy pacific island polynesians living in new zealand participated in the trialinterventions subjects were supplied with some foods rich in the test fats and were given detailed dietary advice which was reinforced regularlyresults plasma lathosterol concentration p  0001 the ratio plasma lathosterolcholesterol p004 low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol p0001 and apob p0001 levels were significantly different among the diets and were significantly lower during coconut and safflower oil diets compared with butter dietsplasma total cholesterol hdl cholesterol and apoalevels were also significantly p or 0001 different among the diets and were not significantly different between buffer and coconut dietsconclusions these data suggest that cholesterol synthesis is lower during diets rich in coconut fat and safflower oil compared with diets rich in butter and might be associated with lower production rates of apobcontaining lipoproteins
