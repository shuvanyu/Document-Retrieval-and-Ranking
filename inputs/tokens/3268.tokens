we have previously discovered that star fruit can induce oliguric acute renal failureto investigate the mechanisms of star fruitassociated acute oxalate nephropathy the nephrotoxic effect of star fruit was examined in both cellular experiments and animal modelswe evaluated renal function pathological changes in kidney tissues and apoptotic effects using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nickend labeling tunel assay in four groups of rats  a control group cg fed with tap water 1 a star fruit group sg fed with star fruit juice naturally containing 02m oxalate 2 and oxalate groups oxg fed with 02m 3 or 04m 4 oxalate solutionthe effects of both star fruit juice and oxalate on mdck cells were also analyzed by flow cytometrywe found that the mean creatinine clearance was significantly lower in the sg 02m oxg and 04m oxgdosedependent apoptotic effects were evident from the tunel assay and flow cytometry analysis of treated mdck cells showed dose and timedependent effectsour findings suggest that star fruit juice produces acute renal injury not only through the obstructive effect of calcium oxalate crystals but also by inducing apoptosis of renal epithelial cells which may be caused by the levels of oxalate in the fruit
