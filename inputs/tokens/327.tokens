a number of chemicals have been shown to demonstrate neurotoxic effects either in human or laboratory animal studiesthis article aims at evaluating the impact of exposure to several chemicals including organophosphate organochlorine pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs mercury and lead on the neurodevelopment of children by reviewing the most recent published literature and answer the question whether any progress has been made in the epidemiology of the neurodevelopment of children induced by exposure to those chemicalsthe result of the presented studies show that exposure to the abovementioned chemicals may impair the neurodevelopment of childrenneonates exposed to organophosphate pesticides demonstrated a higher proportion of abnormal reflexes and young children had more attention problemsexposure to organochlorine pesticides in children was associated with alertness quality of alert responsiveness cost of attention and other potential attention associated measuresthe majority of studies indicate the negative impact of lead exposure at the level 10 µgdl or even 5 µgdl on the neurodevelopment of childrenthe results of studies on exposure to pcbs mercury and their effect on neurodevelopment are inconsistentsome suggest that prenatal exposure to pcbs and mercury is related to performance impairments attention and concentration problems while other do not present any statistically significant associationthe studies were mostly well designed using prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposureconcerning the covariates and confounders affecting the endpoints in most of the presented studies confounders were included in data analysisin order to recognize the early cognitive motor and language outcomes of chemical exposures well standardized tools were used for evaluating the neurodevelopmental effects and offer an early and fairly comprehensive measure of child developmentbecause the neurotoxicants may cross the placenta and the fetal brain exposure consideration regarding the reduction of exposure to those chemicals should be implemented
