background higher intakes of fruit vegetables and dark fish may prevent sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias but the exact mechanisms are not fully understoodobjective we examined whether high consumption of fruit vegetables and dark fish would be associated with beneficial changes in heart rate variability hrvdesign hrv variables were measured among 586 older men with 928 total observations from november 2000 to june 2007 in the normative aging study a communitybased longitudinal study of agingdietary intake was evaluated with a selfadministered semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaire and categorized into quartilesresults after controlling for potential confounders intake of green leafy vegetables was positively associated with normalized highfrequency power and inversely associated with normalized lowfrequency power p for trend  005these significant associations were retained after further adjustment for healthy lifestyle factors such as physical activity and use of multivitaminsno significant association was seen between hrv measures and intakes of other fruit and vegetables vitamin c carotenoids tuna and darkmeat fish or n3 omega3 fatty acidsan effect modification of intake of noncitrus fruit by obesity and of total vegetables and cruciferous vegetables by cigarette smoking was seen which warrants further investigationconclusion these findings suggest that higher intake of green leafy vegetables may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through favorable changes in cardiac autonomic function
