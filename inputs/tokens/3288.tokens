substantial data suggest that flavonoidrich food could help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancercocoa is the richest source of flavonoids but current processing reduces the content substantiallythe kuna living in the san blas drink a flavanolrich cocoa as their main beverage contributing more than 900 mgday and thus probably have the most flavonoidrich diet of any populationwe used diagnosis on death certificates to compare causespecific death rates from year 2000 to 2004 in mainland and the san blas islands where only kuna liveour hypothesis was that if the high flavanoid intake and consequent nitric oxide system activation were important the result would be a reduction in the frequency of ischemic heart disease stroke diabetes mellitus and cancer  all nitric oxide sensitive processesthere were 77375 deaths in mainland panama and 558 deaths in the san blasin mainland panama as anticipated cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death 834  070 age adjusted deaths100000 and cancer was second 684  16in contrast the rate of cvd and cancer among islanddwelling kuna was much lower 92  31 and 44  44 respectivelysimilarly deaths due to diabetes mellitus were much more common in the mainland 241  074 than in the san blas 66  194this comparatively lower risk among kuna in the san blas from the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in much of the world possibly reflects a very high flavanol intake and sustained nitric oxide synthesis activationhowever there are many risk factors and an observational study cannot provide definitive evidence
