hibiscus sabdariffa l is used as a refreshing beverage and as a traditional medicinethe objective of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of phenolic compounds present in aqueous ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of h sabdariffa against mutagenicity of 1nitropyrene 1np and also the antiproliferative effect of these extractsinhibition of cell proliferation and dna fragmentation were tested on transformed human hela cellsthe hot aqueous extract hae contained 2227  252 mg of protocatechuic acid pca per gram of lyophilized dried extract and was not statistically different from the cold aqueous or chloroform extracts the ethyl acetate extract produced the least amount of pcathe h sabdariffa extracts inhibited mutagenicity of 1np in a doseresponse mannerthe inhibition rate on hela cells of hae was also dosedependentthe hae did not induce dna fragmentationthe results suggest that h sabdariffa l extracts have antimutagenic activity against 1np and decrease the proliferation of hela cells probably due to phenolic acid composition
