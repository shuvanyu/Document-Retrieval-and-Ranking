despite the continuing reports supporting the hepatoprotective effects of green tea against ethanol intoxication there remain controversies regarding the active compounds and molecular mechanismthese issues were addressed in the present study using cultured hepg2 cells exposed to a lethal dose of ethanolgammaglutamyl transferase ggt was chosen as a marker of ethanol toxicity because it is widely used in clinicswhen the cells were treated with ethanol at various concentrations there was a dosedependent increase of ggt activity in the culture media and loss of cell viabilitypretreatment of the cells with green tea extract attenuated the changes significantlyamong the green tea constituents epigallocatechin gallate egcg attenuated the ethanol cytotoxicity effectively whereas ltheanine and caffeine had no effectsthe ethanol cytotoxicity was also attenuated by alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4methyl pyrazol and ggt inhibitor acivicin as well as by thiol modulators such as sadenosyllmethionine nacetyllcysteine and glutathioneegcg failed to prevent the intracellular glutathione loss caused by ethanol but it appeared to be a strong ggt inhibitortherefore the cytoprotective effects of green tea could be attributed to the inhibition of ggt activity by egcgthis study suggests that ggt inhibitors including egcg may provide a novel strategy for attenuating ethanolinduced liver damage
