objective to evaluate the hypolipemic and antioxidant effects of soy and green tea alone andor in association in dyslipidemic subjectsmethods one hundred dyslipidemic individuals were allocated into four groupsthe soy group ingested 50 g of soy kinako daily and the green tea group ingested 3 g of green tea in 500 ml of water per daya third group ingested 50 g of soy and 3 g of green tea daily and the control group had a hypocholesterolemic dietevaluations were performed at baseline and after 45 and 90 d plasma levels of total cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein and triacylglycerols were evaluated by automated methodslowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol was calculated using the friedewald equationldl was isolated by ultracentrifugationtotal plasma antioxidant capacity and plasma levels of total lipid hydroperoxides and those linked to ldl were evaluated by chemiluminescencethe results were expressed as median values and their 25th to 75th percentiles with a 5 level of significanceresults no significant difference occurred in ldl highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels across groupshowever a statistically significant difference in total cholesterol occurred within the soygreen tea group 45 and 90 d after interventionno statistically significant difference occurred in plasma levels of lipid hydroperoxides or those linked to ldl in any of the groups studiedall the groups that used soy andor green tea presented increased total plasma antioxidant potentialconclusion soy and green tea alone or in combination increased the total antioxidant potential of hypercholesterolemic patients whereas only the combination decreased total cholesterol levels
