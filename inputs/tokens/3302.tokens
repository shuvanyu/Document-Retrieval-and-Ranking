background oxidative damage is implicated in the etiology of cancer cardiovascular disease and other degenerative disordersrecent nutritional research has focused on the antioxidant potential of foods while current dietary recommendations are to increase the intake of antioxidantrich foods rather than supplement specific nutrientsmany alternatives to refined sugar are available including raw cane sugar plant sapssyrups eg maple syrup agave nectar molasses honey and fruit sugars eg date sugarunrefined sweeteners were hypothesized to contain higher levels of antioxidants similar to the contrast between whole and refined grain productsobjective to compare the total antioxidant content of natural sweeteners as alternatives to refined sugardesign the ferricreducing ability of plasma frap assay was used to estimate total antioxidant capacitymajor brands of 12 types of sweeteners as well as refined white sugar and corn syrup were sampled from retail outlets in the united statesresults substantial differences in total antioxidant content of different sweeteners were foundrefined sugar corn syrup and agave nectar contained minimal antioxidant activity 001 mmol frap100 g raw cane sugar had a higher frap 01 mmol100 gdark and blackstrap molasses had the highest frap 46 to 49 mmol100 g while maple syrup brown sugar and honey showed intermediate antioxidant capacity 02 to 07 mmol frap100 gbased on an average intake of 130 gday refined sugars and the antioxidant activity measured in typical diets substituting alternative sweeteners could increase antioxidant intake an average of 26 mmolday similar to the amount found in a serving of berries or nutsconclusion many readily available alternatives to refined sugar offer the potential benefit of antioxidant activity
