high fructose corn syrup hfcs has become an increasingly common food ingredient in the last 40 yearshowever there is concern that hfcs consumption increases the risk for obesity and other adverse health outcomes compared to other caloric sweetenersthe most commonly used types of hfcs hfcs42 and hfcs55 are similar in composition to sucrose table sugar consisting of roughly equal amounts of fructose and glucosethe primary difference is that these monosaccharides exist free in solution in hfcs but in disaccharide form in sucrosethe disaccharide sucrose is easily cleaved in the small intestine so free fructose and glucose are absorbed from both sucrose and hfcsthe advantage to food manufacturers is that the free monosaccharides in hfcs provide better flavor enhancement stability freshness texture color pourability and consistency in foods in comparison to sucrosebecause the composition of hfcs and sucrose is so similar particularly on absorption by the body it appears unlikely that hfcs contributes more to obesity or other conditions than sucrose doesnevertheless few studies have evaluated the potentially differential effect of various sweeteners particularly as they relate to health conditions such as obesity which develop over relatively long periods of timeimproved nutrient databases are needed to analyze food consumption in epidemiologic studies as are more strongly designed experimental studies including those on the mechanism of action and relationship between fructose dose and responseat the present time there is insufficient evidence to ban or otherwise restrict use of hfcs or other fructosecontaining sweeteners in the food supply or to require the use of warning labels on products containing hfcsnevertheless dietary advice to limit consumption of all added caloric sweeteners including hfcs is warranted
