bovine leukemia virus blv is an oncogenic retrovirus that commonly infects cattle and causes b cell leukosis in 15 of infected cattleblvinfected cells are present in marketed beef and dairy productsin the decade after the discovery of blv in 1969 studies using agar gel immunodiffusion and complement fixation assays failed to find antibodies to blv in human serathis led to the prevailing opinion that exposure of humans to blv andor the potential for infection are not significant and therefore the virus is not a public health hazardwe reexamined this issue using more sensitive immunological techniques available todayusing immunoblotting to test the sera of 257 humans for antibodies of four isotypes igg1 igm iga and igg4 to the blv capsid antigen p24 we detected at least one antibody isotype reactive with blv in 74 of the human sera testedthe specificity of the reactivity was strongly suggested by competition studies and by ruling out crossreacting antibodies to other chronic human virusesour results suggest that antibodies reactive with the blv capsid antigen may serve as a biomarker for exposure to blv and this exposure may be widespreadthe results do not necessarily mean that humans are actually infected with blv the antibodies could be a response to heatdenatured blv antigens consumed in foodthey do however suggest that further studies in this area could be important
