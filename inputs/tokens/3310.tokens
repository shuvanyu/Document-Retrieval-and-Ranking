anthocyanins belonging to the flavonoid family of phytochemicals have received attention as agents that may have potential in preventing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and certain cancersin the present study an anthocyaninrich extract from concord grapes referred to as concord grape extract cge and the anthocyanin delphinidin were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit dna adduct formation due to the environmental carcinogen benzoapyrene bp in mcf10f cells a noncancerous immortalized human breast epithelial cell linecge at 10 and 20 microgml and delphinidin at 06 microm concentrations significantly inhibited bpdna adduct formationthis was associated with a significant increase in activities of the phase ii detoxification enzymes glutathione stransferase and nadphquinone reductase 1in addition these grape components also suppressed reactive oxygen species ros formation but did not induce antioxidant response elementdependent transcriptiontaken together these data suggest that cge and a component grape anthocyanin have breast cancer chemopreventive potential due in part to their capacity to block carcinogendna adduct formation modulate activities of carcinogenmetabolizing enzymes and suppress ros in these noncancerous human breast cells
