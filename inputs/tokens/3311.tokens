context evidence is lacking that a dietary pattern high in vegetables fruit and fiber and low in total fat can influence breast cancer recurrence or survivalobjective to assess whether a major increase in vegetable fruit and fiber intake and a decrease in dietary fat intake reduces the risk of recurrent and new primary breast cancer and allcause mortality among women with previously treated early stage breast cancerdesign setting and participants multiinstitutional randomized controlled trial of dietary change in 3088 women previously treated for early stage breast cancer who were 18 to 70 years old at diagnosiswomen were enrolled between 1995 and 2000 and followed up through june 1 2006intervention the intervention group n1537 was randomly assigned to receive a telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice 3 fruit servings 30 g of fiber and 15 to 20 of energy intake from fatthe comparison group n1551 was provided with print materials describing the 5aday dietary guidelinesmain outcome measures invasive breast cancer event recurrence or new primary or death from any causeresults from comparable dietary patterns at baseline a conservative imputation analysis showed that the intervention group achieved and maintained the following statistically significant differences vs the comparison group through 4 years servings of vegetables 65 fruit 25 fiber 30 and energy intake from fat 13plasma carotenoid concentrations validated changes in fruit and vegetable intakethroughout the study women in both groups received similar clinical careover the mean 73year followup 256 women in the intervention group 167 vs 262 in the comparison group 169 experienced an invasive breast cancer event adjusted hazard ratio 096 95 confidence interval 080114 p63 and 155 intervention group women 101 vs 160 comparison group women 103 died adjusted hazard ratio 091 95 confidence interval 072115 p43no significant interactions were observed between diet group and baseline demographics characteristics of the original tumor baseline dietary pattern or breast cancer treatmentconclusion among survivors of early stage breast cancer adoption of a diet that was very high in vegetables fruit and fiber and low in fat did not reduce additional breast cancer events or mortality during a 73year followup periodtrial registration clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct00003787
