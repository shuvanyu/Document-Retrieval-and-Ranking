it is now well known to consumers around the world that certain fruits and vegetables can help prevent or treat chronic human diseasesbut what many people dont fully appreciate is that it is not a single component in these plantderived foods but rather complex mixtures of interacting natural chemicals that produce such powerful healthprotective effectsthese natural components accumulate simultaneously together in a plant and provide a multifaceted defensive strategy for both the plant and the human consumerin order to investigate the strength of natural chemical cooperation in highlypigmented flavonoidrich functional foods our lab has relied on analysis of both whole fruits and continuous reliable plant cell culture production systems which accumulate anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in high concentrationssuccessive rounds of relatively gentle rapid and largevolume fractionations are linked to bioassay of complex to simple mixtures and semipurified compoundsby means of this strategy additive interactions or synergies between related compounds in health maintenance can be sorted outinterestingly phytochemical interactions between the same classes of compounds intensify the efficacy of flavonoidrich fruits against multiple not necessarily discrete human disease conditions including cvd cancer metabolic syndrome and others
