polyphenolrich berry extracts were screened for their antiproliferative effectiveness using human cervical cancer hela cells grown in microtiter platesrowan berry raspberry lingonberry cloudberry arctic bramble and strawberry extracts were effective but blueberry sea buckthorn and pomegranate extracts were considerably less effectivethe most effective extracts strawberry  arctic bramble  cloudberry  lingonberry gave ec 50 values in the range of 2540 microgml of phenolsthese extracts were also effective against human colon cancer caco2 cells which were generally more sensitive at low concentrations but conversely less sensitive at higher concentrationsthe strawberry cloudberry arctic bramble and the raspberry extracts share common polyphenol constituents especially the ellagitannins which have been shown to be effective antiproliferative agentshowever the components underlying the effectiveness of the lingonberry extracts are not knownthe lingonberry extracts were fractionated into anthocyaninrich and tanninrich fractions by chromatography on sephadex lh20the anthocyaninrich fraction was considerably less effective than the original extract whereas the antiproliferative activity was retained in the tanninrich fractionthe polyphenolic composition of the lingonberry extract was assessed by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry and was similar to previous reportsthe tanninrich fraction was almost entirely composed of procyanidins of linkage type a and btherefore the antiproliferative activity of lingonberry was caused predominantly by procyanidins
