dietary intervention with anthocyanins may confer benefits in brain function including visionresearch to date indicates that animals have only a limited capacity to absorb anthocyanins compared to other types of flavonoidspigs which are a suitable model for human digestive absorption were used to examine the deposition of anthocyanins in tissues including the liver eye and brain tissuepigs were fed diets supplemented with 0 1 2 or 4 ww blueberries  vaccinium corymbosum l jersey for 4 weeksprior to euthanasia pigs were fasted for 1821 h although no anthocyanins were detected in the plasma or urine of the fasted animals intact anthocyanins were detected in all tissues where they were soughtlcmsms results are presented for the relative concentration of 11 intact anthocyanins in the liver eye cortex and cerebellumthe results suggest that anthocyanins can accumulate in tissues including tissues beyond the bloodbrain barrier
