antioxidantrich diets are associated with reduced asthma prevalencehowever direct evidence that altering intake of antioxidantrich foods affects asthma is lackingthe objective was to investigate changes in asthma and airway inflammation resulting from a low antioxidant diet and subsequent use of lycopenerich treatmentsasthmatic adults n32 consumed a low antioxidant diet for 10 days then commenced a randomized crossover trial involving 3 x 7 day treatment arms placebo tomato extract 45 mg lycopeneday and tomato juice 45 mg lycopenedaywith consumption of a low antioxidant diet plasma carotenoid concentrations decreased asthma control score worsened fev1 and fvc decreased and sputum neutrophils increasedtreatment with both tomato juice and extract reduced airway neutrophil influxtreatment with tomato extract also reduced sputum neutrophil elastase activityin conclusion dietary antioxidant consumption modifies clinical asthma outcomeschanging dietary antioxidant intake may be contributing to rising asthma prevalencelycopenerich supplements should be further investigated as a therapeutic intervention
