cooking as a domestic processing method has a great impact on food nutrientsmost brassica brassicaceae cruciferae vegetables are mainly consumed after being cooked and cooking considerably affects their healthpromoting compounds specifically glucosinolates phenolic compunds minerals and vitamin c studied herethe microwave cooking process presents controversial results in the literature due to the different conditions that are employed time power and added watertherefore the aim of this work was to study the influence of these conditions during microwave cooking on the human bioactive compounds of broccolithe results show a general decrease in the levels of all the studied compounds except for mineral nutrients which were stable under all cooking conditionsvitamin c showed the greatest losses mainly because of degradation and leaching whereas losses for phenolic compounds and glucosinolates were mainly due to leaching into waterin general the longest microwave cooking time and the higher volume of cooking water should be avoided to minimize losses of nutrients
