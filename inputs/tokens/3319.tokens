the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common cooking practices ie boiling steaming and frying on phytochemical contents ie polyphenols carotenoids glucosinolates and ascorbic acid total antioxidant capacities tac as measured by three different analytical assays trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity teac total radicaltrapping antioxidant parameter trap ferric reducing antioxidant power frap and physicochemical parameters of three vegetables carrots courgettes and broccoliwatercooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds particularly carotenoids in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in carrots and courgettessteamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality than boiled ones whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discolorationfried vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening even though antioxidant compounds were less retainedan overall increase of teac frap and trap values was observed in all cooked vegetables probably because of matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds which could be partially converted into more antioxidant chemical speciesour findings defy the notion that processed vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and physicochemical qualities
