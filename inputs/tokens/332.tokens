many studies have investigated the neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and early childhood exposures to organophosphate op pesticides among children but they have not been collectively evaluatedthe aim of the present article is to synthesize reported evidence over the last decade on op exposure and neurodevelopmental effects in childrenthe data sources were pubmed web of science ebsco sciverse scopus springerlink scielo and doajthe eligibility criteria considered were studies assessing exposure to op pesticides and neurodevelopmental effects in children from birth to 18 years of age published between 2002 and 2012 in english or spanishtwentyseven articles met the eligibility criteriastudies were rated for evidential consideration as high intermediate or low based upon the study design number of participants exposure measurement and neurodevelopmental measuresall but one of the 27 studies evaluated showed some negative effects of pesticides on neurobehavioral developmenta positive doseresponse relationship between op exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes was found in all but one of the 12 studies that assessed doseresponsein the ten longitudinal studies that assessed prenatal exposure to ops cognitive deficits related to working memory were found in children at age 7 years behavioral deficits related to attention seen mainly in toddlers and motor deficits abnormal reflexes seen mainly in neonatesno metaanalysis was possible due to different measurements of exposure assessment and outcomeseleven studies all longitudinal were rated high 14 studies were rated intermediate and two studies were rated lowevidence of neurological deficits associated with exposure to op pesticides in children is growingthe studies reviewed collectively support the hypothesis that exposure to op pesticides induces neurotoxic effectsfurther research is needed to understand effects associated with exposure in critical windows of development
