a predominantly plantbased diet reduces the risk for development of several chronic diseasesit is often assumed that antioxidants contribute to this protection but results from intervention trials with single antioxidants administered as supplements quite consistently do not support any benefitbecause dietary plants contain several hundred different antioxidants it would be useful to know the total concentration of electrondonating antioxidants ie reductants in individual itemssuch data might be useful in the identification of the most beneficial dietary plantswe have assessed systematically total antioxidants in a variety of dietary plants used worldwide including various fruits berries vegetables cereals nuts and pulseswhen possible we analyzed three or more samples of dietary plants from three different geographic regions in the worldtotal antioxidants was assessed by the reduction of fe3 to fe2 ie the frap assay which occurred rapidly with all reductants with halfreaction reduction potentials above that of fe3fe2the values therefore expressed the corresponding concentration of electrondonating antioxidantsour results demonstrated that there is more than a 1000fold difference among total antioxidants in various dietary plantsplants that contain most antioxidants included members of several families such as rosaceae dog rose sour cherry blackberry strawberry raspberry empetraceae crowberry ericaceae blueberry grossulariaceae black currant juglandaceae walnut asteraceae sunflower seed punicaceae pomegranate and zingiberaceae gingerin a norwegian diet fruits berries and cereals contributed 436 271 and 117 respectively of the total intake of plant antioxidantsvegetables contributed only 89the systematic analysis presented here will facilitate research into the nutritional role of the combined effect of antioxidants in dietary plants
