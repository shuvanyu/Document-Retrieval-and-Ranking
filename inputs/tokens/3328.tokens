in this study the adhesion factors examined were time between frying and coating surface oil content chip temperature oil composition nacl size nacl shape and electrostatic coatingthree different surface oil content potato chips high low and no were producedoils used were soybean olive corn peanut and coconutafter frying chips were coated immediately after 1 d and after 1 monacl crystals of 5 different particle sizes 247 123 259 291 and 388 microm were coated both electrostatically and nonelectrostaticallyadhesion of cubic dendritic and flake crystals was examinedchips were coated at different temperatureschips with high surface oil had the highest adhesion of salt making surface oil content the most important factordecreasing chip temperature decreased surface oil and adhesionincreasing time between frying and coating reduced adhesion for low surface oil chips but did not affect high and no surface oil chipschanging oil composition did not affect adhesionincreasing salt size decreased adhesionsalt size had a greater effect on chips with lower surface oil contentwhen there were significant differences cubic crystals gave the best adhesion followed by flake crystals then dendritic crystalsfor high and low surface oil chips electrostatic coating did not change adhesion of small size crystals but decreased adhesion of large saltsfor no surface oil content chips electrostatic coating improved adhesion for small salt sizes but did not affect adhesion of large crystals
