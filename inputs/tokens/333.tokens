objective to conduct a systematic review of published studies on the association between residentialhouseholddomestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukaemia and to provide a quantitative estimate of the riskmethods publications in english were searched in medline 196631 december 2009 and from the reference list of identified publicationsextraction of relative risk rr estimates was performed independently by 2 authors using predefined inclusion criteriametarate ratio estimates mrr were calculated according to fixed and randomeffect modelsseparate analyses were conducted after stratification for exposure time windows residential exposure location biocide category and type of leukaemiaresults rr estimates were extracted from 13 casecontrol studies published between 1987 and 2009statistically significant associations with childhood leukaemia were observed when combining all studies mrr 174 95 ci 137221exposure during and after pregnancy was positively associated with childhood leukaemia with the strongest risk for exposure during pregnancy mrr 219 95 ci 192250other stratifications showed the greatest risk estimates for indoor exposure mrr 174 95 ci 145209 for exposure to insecticides mrr 173 95 ci 133226 as well as for acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia anll mrr 230 95 ci 153345outdoor exposure and exposure of children to herbicides after pregnancy were not significantly associated with childhood leukaemia mrr 121 95 ci 097152 mrr 116 95 ci 076176 respectivelyconclusions our findings support the assumption that residential pesticide exposure may be a contributing risk factor for childhood leukaemia but available data were too scarce for causality ascertainmentit may be opportune to consider preventive actions including educational measures to decrease the use of pesticides for residential purposes and particularly the use of indoor insecticides during pregnancycopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
