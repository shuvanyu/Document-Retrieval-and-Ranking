background docosahexaenoic acid dha is important to neural developmentwhether dha intakes are low enough in some pregnant women to impair infant development is uncertainobjective we sought to determine whether dha deficiency occurs in pregnant women and contributes to poor infant developmentdesign biochemical cutoffs dietary intakes or developmental scores indicative of dha deficiency are not definedinfant development has a distribution in which an individuals potential development is unknownthis was a randomized intervention to establish a distribution of developmental scores for infants of women with dha intakes considered to be above requirements against which to compare the development of infants of mothers consuming their usual dietdha 400 mgd n  67 or a placebo n  68 was consumed by the women from 16 wk gestation until deliverywe determined maternal red blood cell ethanolamine phosphoglyceride fatty acids dietary intakes at 16 and 36 wk gestation and infant visual acuity at 60 d of ageresults we described an approach to identify dha deficiency when biochemical and functional markers of deficiency are unknownin multivariate analyses infant visual acuity was related to sex beta  0660 se  093 and odds ratio  193 and maternal dha intervention beta  1215 se  164 and odds ratio  337more infant girls in the placebo than in the dha intervention group had a visual acuity below average p  0048maternal red blood cell ethanolamine phosphoglyceride docosatetraenoic acid was inversely related to visual acuity in boys rho  037 p  005 and girls rho  048 p  001conclusions these studies suggest that some pregnant women in our study population were dhadeficient
