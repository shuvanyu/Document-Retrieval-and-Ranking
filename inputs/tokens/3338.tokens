docosahexaenoic acid dha a longchain omega3 fatty acid is important for eye and brain development and ongoing visual cognitive and cardiovascular healthunlike fishsourced oils the bioavailability of dha from vegetariansourced algal oils has not been formally assessedwe assessed bioequivalence of dha oils in capsules from two different algal strains versus bioavailability from an algaldhafortified foodour 28day randomized placebocontrolled parallel group study compared bioavailability of a two different algal dha oils in capsules dhascot and dhascos at doses of 200 600 and 1000 mg dha per day n  12 per group and of b an algaldhafortified food n  12bioequivalence was based on changes in plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte dha levelseffects on arachidonic acid ara docosapentaenoic acidn6 dpan6 and eicosapentaenoic acid epa were also determinedboth dhascot and dhascos capsules produced equivalent dha levels in plasma phospholipids and erythrocytesdha response was dosedependent and linear over the dose range plasma phospholipid dha increased by 117 228 and 303 g per 100 g fatty acid at 200 600 and 1000 mg dose respectivelysnack bars fortified with dhascos oil also delivered equivalent amounts of dha on a dha dose basisadverse event monitoring revealed an excellent safety and tolerability profiletwo different algal oil capsule supplements and an algal oilfortified food represent bioequivalent and safe sources of dha
