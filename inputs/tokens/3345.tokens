due to the favourable health effects of lc n3 pufas marine products have been recognised as a food group of special importance in the human diethowever seafood is susceptible to contamination by lipophilic organic pollutantsthe objective of this study was to evaluate intake levels of pcdds pcdfs and dioxinlike pcbs by a probabilistic monte carlo procedure in relation to the recommendation on lc n3 pufas given by belgian federal health councilregarding the recommendation two scenarios were developed differing in lc n3 pufas intake a 03 e and a 046 e scenariototal exposure to dioxins and dioxinlike substances in the 03 e lc n3 pufas scenario ranges from 231 pg teqkg bwday at the 5th percentile over 437 pg teqkgbwday at the 50th percentile to 841 pg teqkgbwday at the 95th percentilein the 046 e lc n3 pufas scenario 5 50 and 95th percentile are exposed to 274 552 and 998 pg teqkgbwday respectivelytherefore if the recommended lc n3 pufas intake would be based on fish consumption as the only extra source the majority of the study population would exceed the proposed health based guidance values for dioxins and dioxinlike substances
