we and others recently began studying brominated flame retardant levels in various matrices in the us including human milk and other foodthis paper reviews the food studiesin our studies ten to thirteen polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde congeners were measured usually including bde 209all us womens milk samples were contaminated with pbdes from 6 to 419 ngg lipid orders of magnitude higher than levels reported in european studies and are the highest reported worldwidewe compared our market basket studies of meat fish and dairy products with other us food studies of meat and fishus studies showed somewhat higher levels of pbdes than reported elsewherefish were most highly contaminated median 616 pgg then meat median190 pgg and dairy products median 322 pgghowever unlike some european countries where fish predominates dietary intake of pbdes in the us is mostly from meat then fish and then dairy productsbroiling can decrease the amount of pbdes per servingwe also measured levels of hexabromocyclododecane hbcd another brominated flame retardant in human milkthe levels are lower than pbdes 01612 ngg similar to european levels unlike pbdes where us levels are much higher than european levels
