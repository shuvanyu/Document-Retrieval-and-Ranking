the effectiveness of hightemperature short holding time htst pasteurization and homogenization with respect to inactivation of mycobacterium avium subspparatuberculosis was evaluated quantitativelythis allowed a detailed determination of inactivation kineticshigh concentrations of feces from cows with clinical symptoms of johnes disease were used to contaminate raw milk in order to realistically mimic possible incidents most closelyfinal m avium subspparatuberculosis concentrations varying from 102 to 35  105 cells per ml raw milk were usedheat treatments including industrial htst were simulated on a pilot scale with 22 different timetemperature combinations including 60 to 90c at holding mean residence times of 6 to 15 s following 72c and a holding time of 6 s 70c for 10 and 15 s or under more stringent conditions no viable m avium subspparatuberculosis cells were recovered resulting in 42 to 71fold reductions depending on the original inoculum concentrationsinactivation kinetic modeling of 69 quantitative data points yielded an ea of 305635 jmol and an lnk0 of 1072 corresponding to a d value of 12 s at 72c and a z value of 77chomogenization did not significantly affect the inactivationthe conclusion can be drawn that htst pasteurization conditions equal to 15 s at 72c result in a morethansevenfold reduction of m avium subspparatuberculosis
