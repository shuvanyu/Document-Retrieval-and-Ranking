americans consume billions of hotdogs per year resulting in more than a billion dollars in retail salespackage labels typically list some type of meat as the primary ingredientthe purpose of this study is to assess the meat and water content of several hotdog brands to determine if the package labels are accurateeight brands of hotdogs were evaluated for water content by weighta variety of routine techniques in surgical pathology including routine light microscopy with hematoxylineosinstained sections special staining immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used to assess for meat content and for other recognizable componentspackage labels indicated that the toplisted ingredient in all 8 brands was meat the second listed ingredient was water n  6 and another type of meat n  2water comprised 44 to 69 median 57 of the total weightmeat content determined by microscopic crosssection analysis ranged from 29 to 212 median 57the cost per hotdog 012042 roughly correlated with meat contenta variety of tissues were observed besides skeletal muscle including bone n  8 collagen n  8 blood vessels n  8 plant material n  8 peripheral nerve n  7 adipose n  5 cartilage n  4 and skin n  1glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was not observed in any of the hotdogslipid content on oil red o staining was graded as moderate in 3 hotdogs and marked in 5 hotdogselectron microscopy showed recognizable skeletal muscle with evidence of degenerative changesin conclusion hotdog ingredient labels are misleading most brands are more than 50 water by weightthe amount of meat skeletal muscle in most brands comprised less than 10 of the crosssectional surface areamore expensive brands generally had more meatall hotdogs contained other tissue types bone and cartilage not related to skeletal muscle brain tissue was not present
