objective this study investigated the effects of a soybased lowcalorie diet on weight control body composition and blood lipid profiles compared with a traditional lowcalorie dietmethods thirty obese adults mean body mass index 2930 kgm2 were randomized to two groupsthe soybased lowcalorie group consumed soy protein as the only protein source and the traditional lowcalorie group consumed twothirds animal protein and the rest plant protein in a 1200 kcald diet for 8 wka diet record was kept everyday throughout the studyfood intake was analyzed before and after the studyanthropometric data were acquired every week and biochemical data from before and after the 8wk experiment were comparedresults body weight body mass index body fat percentage and waist circumference significantly decreased in both groups p  005the decrease in body fat percentage in the soy group 22 95 confidence interval 1628 was greater than that in the traditional group 14 95 confidence interval 01 to 28serum total cholesterol concentrations lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and liver function parameters decreased in the soybased group and were significantly different from measurements in the traditional group p  005no significant change in serum triacylglycerol levels serum highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels and fasting glucose levels was found in the soy or traditional groupconclusion soybased lowcalorie diets significantly decreased serum total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and had a greater effect on reducing body fat percentage than traditional lowcalorie dietsthus soybased diets have health benefits in reducing weight and blood lipids
