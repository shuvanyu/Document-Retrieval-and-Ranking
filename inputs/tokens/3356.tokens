most of the early studies published on soy and breast cancer were not designed to test the effect of soy the assessment of soy intake was usually crude and few potential confounders were considered in the analysisin this review we focused on studies with relatively complete assessment of dietary soy exposure in the targeted populations and appropriate consideration for potential confounders in the statistical analysis of study datametaanalysis of the 8 1 cohort 7 casecontrol studies conducted in highsoyconsuming asians show a significant trend of decreasing risk with increasing soy food intakecompared to the lowest level of soy food intake 5 mg isoflavones per day risk was intermediate or088 95 confidence interval ci078098 among those with modest 10 mg isoflavones per day intake and lowest or071 95 ci060085 among those with high intake 20 mg isoflavones per dayin contrast soy intake was unrelated to breast cancer risk in studies conducted in the 11 lowsoyconsuming western populations whose average highest and lowest soy isoflavone intake levels were around 08 and 015 mg per day respectivelythus the evidence to date based largely on casecontrol studies suggest that soy food intake in the amount consumed in asian populations may have protective effects against breast cancer
