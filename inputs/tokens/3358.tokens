background laboratory research and a growing number of epidemiologic studies have provided evidence for a reduced risk of breast cancer associated with dietary intake of certain classes of flavonoidshowever the effects of flavonoids on survival are not knownin a populationbased cohort of breast cancer patients we investigated whether dietary flavonoid intake before diagnosis is associated with subsequent survivalmethods women ages 25 to 98 years who were newly diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer between august 1 1996 and july 31 1997 and participated in a populationbased casecontrol study n1210 were followed for vital status through december 31 2002at the casecontrol interview conducted shortly after diagnosis respondents completed a ffq that assessed dietary intake in the previous 12 monthsallcause mortality n173 deaths and breast cancerspecific mortality n113 deaths were determined through the national death indexresults reduced hazard ratios age and energyadjusted hazard ratio 95 confidence interval for allcause mortality were observed among premenopausal and postmenopausal women for the highest quintile of intake compared with the lowest for flavones 063 041096 isoflavones 052 033082 and anthocyanidins 064 042098no significant trends in risk were observedresults were similar for breast cancerspecific mortality onlyconclusion mortality may be reduced in association with high levels of dietary flavones and isoflavones among postmenopausal us breast cancer patientslarger studies are needed to confirm our findings
