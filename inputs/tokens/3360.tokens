objective to compare the effects of two commercially available soy milks one made using whole soy beans the other using soy protein isolate with lowfat dairy milk on plasma lipid insulin and glucose responsesdesign randomized clinical trial crossover designsubjects participants were 3065 years of age n  28 with prestudy ldlcholesterol ldlc concentrations of 160220 mgdl not on lipid lowering medications and with an overall framingham risk score of or10intervention participants were required to consume sufficient milk to provide 25 g proteind from each sourcethe protocol included three 4week treatment phases each separated from the next by a washout period of or4 weeksresults mean ldlc concentration at the end of each phase  sd was 161  20 161  26 and 170  24 mgdl for the whole bean soy milk the soy protein isolate milk and the dairy milk respectively p  09 between soy milks p  002 for each soy milk vs dairy milkno significant differences by type of milk were observed for hdlcholesterol triacylglycerols insulin or glucoseconclusion a 25 g dose of daily soy protein from soy milk led to a modest 5 lowering of ldlc relative to dairy milk among adults with elevated ldlcthe effect did not differ by type of soy milk and neither soy milk significantly affected other lipid variables insulin or glucose
