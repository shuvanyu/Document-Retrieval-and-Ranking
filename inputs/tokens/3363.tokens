background drinking mate has been associated with cancers of the esophagus oropharynx larynx lung kidney and bladderwe conducted this study to determine whether drinking mate could lead to substantial exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah including known carcinogens such as benzoapyrenemethods the concentrations of 21 individual pahs were measured in dry leaves of eight commercial brands of yerba mate and in infusions made with hot 80 degrees c or cold 5 degrees c watermeasurements were done using gas chromatographymass spectrometry with deuterated pahs as the surrogatesinfusions were made by adding water to the leaves removing the resulting infusion after 5 min and then adding more water to the remaining leavesthis process was repeated 12 times for each infusion temperatureresults the total concentrations of the 21 pahs in different brands of yerba mate ranged from 536 to 2906 ngg dry leavesbenzoapyrene concentrations ranged from 803 to 533 ngg dry leavesfor the mate infusions prepared using hot water and brand 1 37 1092 of 2906 ng of the total measured pahs and 50 251 of 50 ng of the benzoapyrene content were released into the 12 infusionssimilar results were obtained for other hot and cold infusionsconclusion very high concentrations of carcinogenic pahs were found in yerba mate leaves and in hot and cold mate infusionsour results support the hypothesis that the carcinogenicity of mate may be related to its pah content
