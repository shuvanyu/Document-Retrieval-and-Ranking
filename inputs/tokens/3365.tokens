background reduction in dietary cholesterol is recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease cvdalthough eggs are important sources of cholesterol and other nutrients limited and inconsistent data are available on the effects of egg consumption on the risk of cvd and mortalityobjectives to examine the association between egg consumption and the risk of cvd and mortalitydesign prospective cohort study of 21327 participants from the physicians health study iegg consumption was assessed using a simple abbreviated food questionnairewe used cox regression to estimate relative risksresults after an average follow up of 20 years a total of 1550 new myocardial infarction mi 1342 incident strokes and 5169 deaths occurred in this cohortegg consumption was not associated with incident mi or stroke in a multivariable cox regressionin contrast adjusted hazard ratios 95 ci for mortality were 10 reference 094 087102 103 095111 105 093119 and 123 111136 for egg consumption of 1 1 24 56 and 7 per week respectively p for trend 00001this association was stronger among diabetic subjects with a 2fold increased risk of death comparing the highest to the lowest category of egg consumption than nondiabetic subjects hr 122 109135 p for interaction 009conclusions our data suggest that infrequent egg consumption does not influence the risk of cvd and only confers a modest increased risk for total mortality in male physiciansin addition egg consumption was positively related to mortality and such relation was stronger among diabetic subjects in this selective population
