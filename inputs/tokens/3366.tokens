background it has recently been shown that oxidative stress infection and inflammation are predominant pathophysiologic factors for several major diseasesobjective we investigated the association of wholegrain intake with death attributed to noncardiovascular noncancer inflammatory diseasesdesign postmenopausal women n  41 836 aged 5569 y at baseline in 1986 were followed for 17 yafter exclusions for cardiovascular disease cancer diabetes colitis and liver cirrhosis at baseline 27 312 participants remained of whom 5552 died during the 17 ya proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for age smoking adiposity education physical activity and other dietary factorsresults inflammationrelated death was inversely associated with wholegrain intakecompared with the hazard ratios in women who rarely or never ate wholegrain foods the hazard ratio was 069 95 ci 057 083 for those who consumed 47 servingswk 079 066 095 for 75105 servingswk 064 053 079 for 11185 servingswk and 066 054 081 for or19 servingswk p for trend  001previously reported inverse associations of wholegrain intake with total and coronary heart disease mortality persisted after 17 y of followupconclusions the reduction in inflammatory mortality associated with habitual wholegrain intake was larger than that previously reported for coronary heart disease and diabetesbecause a variety of phytochemicals are found in whole grains that may directly or indirectly inhibit oxidative stress and because oxidative stress is an inevitable consequence of inflammation we suggest that oxidative stress reduction by constituents of whole grain is a likely mechanism for the protective effect
