context antioxidant supplements are used for prevention of several diseasesobjective to assess the effect of antioxidant supplements on mortality in randomized primary and secondary prevention trialsdata sources and trial selection we searched electronic databases and bibliographies published by october 2005all randomized trials involving adults comparing beta carotene vitamin a vitamin c ascorbic acid vitamin e and selenium either singly or combined vs placebo or vs no intervention were included in our analysisrandomization blinding and followup were considered markers of bias in the included trialsthe effect of antioxidant supplements on allcause mortality was analyzed with randomeffects metaanalyses and reported as relative risk rr with 95 confidence intervals cismetaregression was used to assess the effect of covariates across the trialsdata extraction we included 68 randomized trials with 232 606 participants 385 publicationsdata synthesis when all low and highbias risk trials of antioxidant supplements were pooled together there was no significant effect on mortality rr 102 95 ci 098106multivariate metaregression analyses showed that lowbias risk trials rr 116 95 ci 104corrected129 and selenium rr 0998 95 ci 099709995 were significantly associated with mortalityin 47 lowbias trials with 180 938 participants the antioxidant supplements significantly increased mortality rr 105 95 ci 102108in lowbias risk trials after exclusion of selenium trials beta carotene rr 107 95 ci 102111 vitamin a rr 116 95 ci 110124 and vitamin e rr 104 95 ci 101107 singly or combined significantly increased mortalityvitamin c and selenium had no significant effect on mortalityconclusions treatment with beta carotene vitamin a and vitamin e may increase mortalitythe potential roles of vitamin c and selenium on mortality need further study
