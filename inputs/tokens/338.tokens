background sale of organic foods is one of the fastest growing market segments within the global food industrypeople often buy organic food because they believe organic farms produce more nutritious and better tasting food from healthier soilshere we tested if there are significant differences in fruit and soil quality from 13 pairs of commercial organic and conventional strawberry agroecosystems in californiamethodologyprincipal findings at multiple sampling times for two years we evaluated three varieties of strawberries for mineral elements shelf life phytochemical composition and organoleptic propertieswe also analyzed traditional soil properties and soil dna using microarray technologywe found that the organic farms had strawberries with longer shelf life greater dry matter and higher antioxidant activity and concentrations of ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds but lower concentrations of phosphorus and potassiumin one variety sensory panels judged organic strawberries to be sweeter and have better flavor overall acceptance and appearance than their conventional counterpartswe also found the organically farmed soils to have more total carbon and nitrogen greater microbial biomass and activity and higher concentrations of micronutrientsorganically farmed soils also exhibited greater numbers of endemic genes and greater functional gene abundance and diversity for several biogeochemical processes such as nitrogen fixation and pesticide degradationconclusionssignificance our findings show that the organic strawberry farms produced higher quality fruit and that their higher quality soils may have greater microbial functional capability and resilience to stressthese findings justify additional investigations aimed at detecting and quantifying such effects and their interactions
