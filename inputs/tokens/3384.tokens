it was previously reported that a methanol extract of gloiopeltis furcata megf a kind of edible seaweed inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell linesin the present study the effect of megf on the growth of human hepatocarcinoma hepg2 cells and its effect on the cyclooxygenases coxs expression were investigatedmegf markedly reduced the viability of hepg2 cells and induced the g2m arrest of the cell cycle in a concentration dependent mannerthese effects were associated with the downregulation of cyclin a upregulation of cyclindependent kinase cdk inhibitor p21 waf1cip1 and dephosphorylation of cdc25cfurthermore it was found that megf decreased the levels of cox2 mrna and protein expression without significant changes in the levels of cox1 which was correlated with a decrease in prostaglandin e2 pge2 synthesisthese findings indicate that megf may have a possible therapeutic potential in hepatoma cancer patients
