objective to compare fracture rates in four diet groups meat eaters fish eaters vegetarians and vegans in the oxford cohort of the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epicoxforddesign prospective cohort study of selfreported fracture risk at followupsetting the united kingdomsubjects a total of 7947 men and 26749 women aged 2089 years including 19249 meat eaters 4901 fish eaters 9420 vegetarians and 1126 vegans recruited by postal methods and through general practice surgeriesmethods cox regressionresults over an average of 52 years of followup 343 men and 1555 women reported one or more fracturescompared with meat eaters fracture incidence rate ratios in men and women combined adjusted for sex age and nondietary factors were 101 95 ci 088117 for fish eaters 100 089113 for vegetarians and 130 102166 for vegansafter further adjustment for dietary energy and calcium intake the incidence rate ratio among vegans compared with meat eaters was 115 089149among subjects consuming at least 525 mgday calcium the corresponding incidence rate ratios were 105 090121 for fish eaters 102 090115 for vegetarians and 100 069144 for vegansconclusions in this population fracture risk was similar for meat eaters fish eaters and vegetariansthe higher fracture risk in the vegans appeared to be a consequence of their considerably lower mean calcium intakean adequate calcium intake is essential for bone health irrespective of dietary preferencessponsorship the epicoxford study is supported by the medical research council and cancer research uk
