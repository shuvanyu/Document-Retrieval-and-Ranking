cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown in a variety of subject models to inhibit oxidized ldl and atherogenesisour study evaluated plasma ldl cholesterol and oxidized ldl concentrations following the intake of different levels of cocoa powder 13 195 and 26 gd in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic humansin this comparative doubleblind study we examined 160 subjects who ingested either cocoa powder containing lowpolyphenolic compounds placebococoa group or 3 levels of cocoa powder containing highpolyphenolic compounds 13 195 and 26 gd for low middle and highcocoa groups respectively for 4 wkthe test powders were consumed as a beverage after the addition of hot water twice each dayblood samples were collected at baseline and 4 wk after intake of the test beverages for the measurement of plasma lipidsplasma oxidized ldl concentrations decreased in the low middle and highcocoa groups compared with baselinea stratified analysis was performed on 131 subjects who had a ldl cholesterol concentrations of  or 323 mmoll at baselinein these subjects plasma ldl cholesterol oxidized ldl and apo b concentrations decreased and the plasma hdl cholesterol concentration increased relative to baseline in the low middle and highcocoa groupsthe results suggest that polyphenolic substances derived from cocoa powder may contribute to a reduction in ldl cholesterol an elevation in hdl cholesterol and the suppression of oxidized ldl
