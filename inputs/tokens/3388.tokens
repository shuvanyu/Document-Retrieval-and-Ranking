there has been considerable work on the relationships between nutrition and the immune response particularly on studies that have focused on adaptive responsesthere is increasing recognition of the importance of innate immunity in host protection and initiation of cytokine networksin this study we examined the effect of select cocoa flavanols and procyanidins on innate responses in vitroperipheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs as well as purified monocytes and cd4 and cd8 t cells were isolated from healthy volunteers and cultured in the presence of cocoa flavanol fractions that differ from another by the degree of flavanol polymerization shortchain flavanol fraction scff monomers to pentamers and longchain flavanol fraction lcff hexamers to decamersparallel investigations were also done with highly purified flavanol monomers and procyanidin dimersthe isolated cells were then challenged with lipopolysaccharide lps with quantitation of activation using cd69 and cd83 expression and analysis of secreted tumor necrosis factor tnfalpha interleukin il1beta il6 il10 and granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsfthe chain length of flavanol fractions had a significant effect on cytokine release from both unstimulated and lpsstimulated pbmcsfor example there was a striking increase of lpsinduced synthesis of il1beta il6 il10 and tnfalpha in the presence of lcfflcff and scff in the absence of lps stimulated the production of gmcsfin addition lcff and scff increased expression of the b cell markers cd69 and cd83there were also unique differential responses in the mononuclear cell populations studiedwe conclude that the oligomers are potent stimulators of both the innate immune system and early events in adaptive immunity
