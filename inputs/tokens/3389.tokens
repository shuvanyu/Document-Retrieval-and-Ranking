context regular intake of cocoacontaining foods is linked to lower cardiovascular mortality in observational studiesshortterm interventions of at most 2 weeks indicate that high doses of cocoa can improve endothelial function and reduce blood pressure bp due to the action of the cocoa polyphenols but the clinical effect of low habitual cocoa intake on bp and the underlying bplowering mechanisms are unclearobjective to determine effects of low doses of polyphenolrich dark chocolate on bpdesign setting and participants randomized controlled investigatorblinded parallelgroup trial involving 44 adults aged 56 through 73 years 24 women 20 men with untreated upperrange prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension without concomitant risk factorsthe trial was conducted at a primary care clinic in germany between january 2005 and december 2006intervention participants were randomly assigned to receive for 18 weeks either 63 g 30 kcal per day of dark chocolate containing 30 mg of polyphenols or matching polyphenolfree white chocolatemain outcome measures primary outcome measure was the change in bp after 18 weekssecondary outcome measures were changes in plasma markers of vasodilative nitric oxide snitrosoglutathione and oxidative stress 8isoprostane and bioavailability of cocoa polyphenolsresults from baseline to 18 weeks dark chocolate intake reduced mean sd systolic bp by 29 16 mm hg p  001 and diastolic bp by 19 10 mm hg p  001 without changes in body weight plasma levels of lipids glucose and 8isoprostanehypertension prevalence declined from 86 to 68the bp decrease was accompanied by a sustained increase of snitrosoglutathione by 023 012 nmoll p  001 and a dark chocolate dose resulted in the appearance of cocoa phenols in plasmawhite chocolate intake caused no changes in bp or plasma biomarkersconclusions data in this relatively small sample of otherwise healthy individuals with aboveoptimal bp indicate that inclusion of small amounts of polyphenolrich dark chocolate as part of a usual diet efficiently reduced bp and improved formation of vasodilative nitric oxidetrial registration clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct00421499
