it has been shown that feces of patients with ulcerative colitis uniformly contain sulfate reducing bacteriasulfide produced by these bacteria interferes with butyratedependent energy metabolism of cultured colonocytes and may be involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitismucosal biopsies from the sigmoid rectum of 10 patients no caner polyps inflammatory bowel disease were incubated with either nacl sodium hydrogen sulfide 1 mmoll a combination of both sodium hydrogen sulfide and butyrate 10 mmoll or butyratemucosal proliferation was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine labeling of cells in sphasecompared to nacl sulfide increased the labeling of the entire crypt significantly by 19 p  005this effect was due to an expansion of the proliferative zone to the upper crypt compartments 35 where the increase in proliferation was 54sulfideinduced hyperproliferation was reversed when samples were coincubated with sulfide and butyratethe study shows that sodium hydrogen sulfide induces mucosal hyperproliferationour data support a possible role of sulfide in the pathogenesis of uc and confirm the role of butyrate in the regulation of colonic proliferation and in the treatment of uc
