background cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit ldl oxidation and atherogenesisobjective we examined whether longterm intake of cocoa powder alters plasma lipid profiles in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic human subjectsdesign twentyfive subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either 12 g sugard control group or 26 g cocoa powder and 12 g sugard cocoa group for 12 wkblood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of the test drinksplasma lipids ldl oxidative susceptibility and urinary oxidative stress markers were measuredresults at 12 wk we measured a 9 prolongation from baseline levels in the lag time of ldl oxidation in the cocoa groupthis prolongation in the cocoa group was significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group 13a significantly greater increase in plasma hdl cholesterol 24 was observed in the cocoa group than in the control group 5a negative correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of hdl cholesterol and oxidized ldlat 12 wk there was a 24 reduction in dityrosine from baseline concentrations in the cocoa groupthis reduction in the cocoa group was significantly greater than the reduction in the control group 1conclusion it is possible that increases in hdlcholesterol concentrations may contribute to the suppression of ldl oxidation and that polyphenolic substances derived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in hdl cholesterol
