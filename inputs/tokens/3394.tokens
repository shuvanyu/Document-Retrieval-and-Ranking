objectives we sought to investigate whether the addition of walnuts or olive oil to a fatty meal have differential effects on postprandial vasoactivity lipoproteins markers of oxidation and endothelial activation and plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine admabackground compared with a mediterranean diet a walnut diet has been shown to improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patientswe hypothesized that walnuts would reverse postprandial endothelial dysfunction associated with consumption of a fatty mealmethods we randomized in a crossover design 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with hypercholesterolemia to 2 highfat meal sequences to which 25 g olive oil or 40 g walnuts had been addedboth test meals contained 80 g fat and 35 saturated fatty acids and consumption of each meal was separated by 1 weekvenipunctures and ultrasound measurements of brachial artery endothelial function were performed after fasting and 4 h after test mealsresults in both study groups flowmediated dilation fmd was worse after the olive oil meal than after the walnut meal p  0006 timeperiod interactionfasting but not postprandial triglyceride concentrations correlated inversely with fmd r  0324 p  0024flowindependent dilation and plasma adma concentrations were unchanged and the concentration of oxidized lowdensity lipoproteins decreased p  0051 after either mealthe plasma concentrations of soluble inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules decreased p  001 independently of meal type except for eselectin which decreased more p  0033 after the walnut mealconclusions adding walnuts to a highfat meal acutely improves fmd independently of changes in oxidation inflammation or admaboth walnuts and olive oil preserve the protective phenotype of endothelial cells
