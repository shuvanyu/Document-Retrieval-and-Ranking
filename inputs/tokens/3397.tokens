tea leaves produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading pathogens including insects bacteria fungi and virusesthese metabolites include polyphenolic compounds the six socalled catechins and the methylxanthine alkaloids caffeine theobromine and theophyllinepostharvest inactivation of phenol oxidases in green tea leaves prevents oxidation of the catechins whereas postharvest enzymecatalyzed oxidation fermentation of catechins in tea leaves results in the formation of four theaflavins as well as polymeric thearubiginsthese substances impart the black color to black teasblack and partly fermented oolong teas contain both classes of phenolic compoundsa need exists to develop a better understanding of the roles of polyphenolic tea compounds in food and medical microbiologythis overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of activities of tea flavonoids and teas against foodborne and other pathogenic bacteria virulent protein toxins produced by some of the bacteria virulent bacteriophages pathogenic viruses and fungialso covered are synergistic mechanistic and bioavailability aspects of the antimicrobial effectsfurther research is suggested for each of these categoriesthe herein described findings are not only of fundamental interest but also have practical implications for nutrition food safety and animal and human health
