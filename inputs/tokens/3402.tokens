dietary flavonols and flavones are subgroups of flavonoids that have been suggested to decrease the risk of coronary heart disease chdthe authors prospectively evaluated intakes of flavonols and flavones in relation to risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal chd in the nurses health studythey assessed dietary information from the studys 1990 1994 and 1998 food frequency questionnaires and computed cumulative average intakes of flavonols and flavonescox proportional hazards regression with timevarying variables was used for analysisduring 12 years of followup 19902002 the authors documented 938 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 324 chd deaths among 66360 womenthey observed no association between flavonol or flavone intake and risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal chdhowever a weak risk reduction for chd death was found among women with a higher intake of kaempferol an individual flavonol found primarily in broccoli and teawomen in the highest quintile of kaempferol intake relative to those in the lowest had a multivariate relative risk of 066 95 confidence interval 048 093 p for trend  004the lower risk associated with kaempferol intake was probably attributable to broccoli consumptionthese prospective data do not support an inverse association between flavonol or flavone intake and chd risk
