a study was performed to investigate the antimutagenic effect of broccoli flower head by the ames salmonella reverse mutation assaybroccoli flower head being the most highly edible part in the plant was analysed for its antimutagenic effectwithout isolating the phytomolecules the crude ethanol extract of broccoli flower head was tested for suppressing the mutagenic effect induced by certain chemical mutagensthree strains  ta 98 ta102 and ta 1535 were used in the studythe tester strains were challenged with their respective mutagensthese were challenged with the ethanol extract of broccoli flower head at concentrations of 23 and 46 mgplatethe plates were incubated for 72 h and the revertant colonies were countedthe crude extract did not prove to be promutagenicthe ethanol extract of the broccoli flower head at 46 mgplate suppressed the mutagenic effect induced by the corresponding positive mutagens on all the three tester strains used in this studythe crude extract of broccoli flower head alone was not cytotoxic even at the maximum concentration tested 46 mgplatein conclusion the ethanol extract of broccoli at 46 mgplate suggests their diverse antimutagenic potential against the mutagenic chemicals employed in this studyc 2007 john wiley  sons ltd
