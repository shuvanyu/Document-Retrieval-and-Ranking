exogenous dietary putrescine 14diaminobutane can increase growth rates of neonatal animals including calves chicks and piglets under nutritional stressturkey poults often have a high mortality rate and this may be due to poor initial feeding behavior and inadequate development of the intestinal tractwe conducted an experiment to determine the effect of dietary putrescine supplementation on growth performance and the role of dietary putrescine in prevention and recovery from a coccidial challengea total of 160 1dold turkey poults were fed a corn and soybean mealbased starter diet supplemented with 00 control 01 02 and 03 g100 g purified putrescine 8 birdspen 5 pensdietat 14 d of age half the birds were infected with approximately 43000 sporulated oocyststhe experiment lasted 24 d fecal samples were gathered from d 3 to d 5 postinfection by total collectionten control and 10 infected birds fed each diet were sampled on d 6 and d 10 postinfectionthe induced infection produced significant depressions in growth and feed intake and detrimental morphological changes in the small intestine of poults in the absence of mortalityweight gains protein content of jejunum and morphometric indices of duodenum jejunum and ileum were greater in challenged poults fed 03 g100 g putrescine than in controlswe conclude that dietary putrescine supplementation may be beneficial to poult growth mucosal development of the small intestine and to recovery from subclinical coccidiosis
