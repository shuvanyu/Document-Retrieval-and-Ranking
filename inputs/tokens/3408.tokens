objectives the phytoestrogen plant estrogen genistein present in soy products is of interest because in utero exposure to genistein can cause hypospadias in our mouse model and maternal consumption of soy is prevalent in human populationsanother compound of interest is the fungicide vinclozolin which also causes hypospadias in the mouse and rat and can occur concurrently with genistein in the diet as a residue on exposed foodsa study in the united kingdom found no relationship between a maternal organic vegetarian diet and hypospadias frequency but women who consumed nonorganic vegetarian diets had a greater percentage of sons with hypospadiasbecause nonorganic diets can include residues of pesticides such as vinclozolin we sought to assess the interaction of realistic daily exposures to genistein and vinclozolin and their effects on the incidence of hypospadiasmethods pregnant mice were fed a soyfree diet and orally gavaged from gestational days 13 to 17 with 017 mgkgday of genistein 10 mgkgday of vinclozolin or genistein and vinclozolin together at the same doses all in 100 microl of corn oilthe controls received the corn oil vehiclethe male fetuses were examined at gestational day 19 for hypospadias both macroscopically and histologicallyresults we identified no hypospadias in the corn oil groupthe incidence of hypospadias was 25 with genistein alone 42 with vinclozolin alone and 41 with genistein and vinclozolin togetherconclusions these findings support the idea that exposure to these compounds during gestation could contribute to the development of hypospadias
