we investigated the effect of resistant starch rs on markers of colonic protein metabolismeleven subjects participated in a randomized crossover study in which they consumed either highrs 39  3 gd chi  sem or lowrs 5  04 gd diets for 3 wkall other macronutrients were kept constantduring the highrs diet daily excretion of fecal nitrogen increased from 184  015 to 286  042 gd p  001 and excretion of fecal phenols fell from 92  14 to 53  08 mgd p  001fecal concentrations of ammonia decreased from 397  33 to 278  49 microgramg p  001 and phenols decreased from 69  8 to 39  10 microgramg p  0001daily output of urinary ammonia urea phenols and total nitrogen did not change significantly but ph decreased from 64  01 to 62  01 p  005 during the highrs periodthese results suggest that rs significantly attenuates the accumulation of potentially harmful byproducts of protein fermentation in the human colon
