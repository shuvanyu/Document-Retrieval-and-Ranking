a flaxseed lignan extract containing 33 secoisolariciresinol diglucoside sdg was evaluated for its ability to alleviate lower urinary tract symptoms luts in 87 subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia bpha randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trial with repeated measurements was conducted over a 4month period using treatment dosages of 0 placebo 300 or 600 mgday sdgafter 4 months of treatment 78 of the 87 subjects completed the studyfor the 0 300 and 600 mgday sdg groups respectively the international prostate symptom score ipss decreased 367  156 733  118 and 688  143 mean  se p  100  001 and  001 compared to baseline the quality of life score qol score improved by 071  023 148  024 and 175  025 mean  se p  163 and 012 compared to placebo and p  103  001 and  001 compared to baseline and the number of subjects whose luts grade changed from moderatesevere to mild increased by three six and 10 p  188 032 and 012 compared to baselinemaximum urinary flows insignificantly increased 043  157 186  108 and 27  193 mlsecond mean  se no statistical significance reached and postvoiding urine volume decreased insignificantly by 294  2046 192  1691 and 5562  3645 ml mean  se no statistical significance reachedplasma concentrations of secoisolariciresinol seco enterodiol ed and enterolactone el were significantly raised after the supplementationthe observed decreases in ipss and qol score were correlated with the concentrations of plasma total lignans seco ed and elin conclusion dietary flaxseed lignan extract appreciably improves luts in bph subjects and the therapeutic efficacy appeared comparable to that of commonly used intervention agents of alpha1aadrenoceptor blockers and 5alphareductase inhibitors
