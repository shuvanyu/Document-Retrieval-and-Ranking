objective alphalinolenic acid ala is the natural precursor of the cardioprotective longchain n3 fatty acidsavailable data indicate a possible beneficial effect of ala on cardiovascular disease cvd but the response of various cvd risk factors to increased ala intake is not well characterizedthe purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of increased ala intake on blood pressure in mandesign setting subjects and interventions we used a prospective twogroup parallelarm design to examine the effect of a 12week dietary supplementation with flaxseed oil rich in ala 8 gday on blood pressure in middleaged dyslipidaemic men n59the diet of the control group was supplemented with safflower oil containing the equivalent n6 fatty acid 11 gday linoleic acid la n28arterial blood pressure was measured at the beginning and at the end of the dietary intervention periodresults supplementation with ala resulted in significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels compared with la p0016 and p0011 respectively from analysis of variance anova for repeated measuresconclusions we observed a hypotensive effect of ala which may constitute another mechanism accounting in part for the apparent cardioprotective effect of this n3 fatty acid
