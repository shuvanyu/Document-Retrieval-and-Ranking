recent evidence suggests overall dietary patterns rather than specific dietary components may be a better predictor of colorectal adenomas or cancersusing cluster analysis we aimed to assess the association between dietary patterns and colorectal adenomas and whether adjusting for total energy consumption prior to creating clusters affects this relationdata from a casecontrol study of 725 individuals undergoing a colonoscopy were utilizedcases n  203 had  or 1 adenoma on colonoscopy and controls n  522 were those who had no adenomasdietary data were obtained from an ffqdaily intake for 18 different food groups was calculatedthe values were transformed into zscoresparticipants were first clustered without energy adjustment then again based on their consumption per 1000 kcal 4187 kjthere was no association between dietary patterns and colorectal adenomas without energy adjustment prior to creating dietary clusters as clusters formed as a byproduct of energy consumptionafter adjusting for energy consumption 3 distinct clusters emerged 1 high fruitlow meat cluster 2 high vegetablemoderate meat cluster and 3 high meat clusterafter adjusting for potential confounders the high vegetablemoderate meat cluster odds ratio or 217 95 ci 120390 and high meat cluster or 170 95 ci 104280 were at significantly increased odds of having had an adenoma compared with the high fruitlow meat clustera highfruit lowmeat diet appears to be protective against colorectal adenomas compared with a dietary pattern of increased vegetable and meat consumption
