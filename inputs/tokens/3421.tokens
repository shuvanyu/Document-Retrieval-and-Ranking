background reports of relationships between dietary fibre intake and breast cancer have been inconsistentprevious cohort studies have been limited by a narrow range of intakesmethods women who developed invasive breast cancer 350 postmenopausally and 257 premenopausally during 240959 personyears of followup in the uk womens cohort study ukwcs were studiedthis cohort has 35792 subjects with a wide range of exposure to dietary fibre with intakes of total fibre in the lowest quintile of 20 gday up to 30 gday in the top quintilefibre and breast cancer relationships were explored using cox regression modelling adjusted for measurement erroreffects of fibre adjusting for confounders were examined for pre and postmenopausal women separatelyresults in premenopausal but not postmenopausal women a statistically significant inverse relationship was found between total fibre intake and risk of breast cancer p for trend  001the top quintile of fibre intake was associated with a hazard ratio of 048 95 confidence interval ci 024096 compared with the lowest quintilepremenopausally fibre from cereals was inversely associated with risk of breast cancer p for trend  005 and fibre from fruit had a borderline inverse relationship p for trend  009a further model including dietary folate strengthened the significance of the inverse relationship between total fibre and premenopausal breast cancerconclusions these findings suggest that in premenopausal women total fibre is protective against breast cancer in particular fibre from cereals and possibly fruit
