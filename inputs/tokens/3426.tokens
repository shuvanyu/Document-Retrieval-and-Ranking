background nitrosamines which are known bladder carcinogens or their precursors are found in certain meat items and concentrations of these compounds are especially high in bacononly 3 cohort studies all with 100 case subjects have examined the relation between meat intake and bladder cancer and few studies have examined the relation of different meat types with bladder cancerobjective the aim was to examine the association between specific meat items and bladder cancer in 2 large prospective studiesdesign we analyzed data from 2 cohorts with up to 22 y of followup and 808 incident bladder cancer casesdetailed data on meat were obtained from multiple foodfrequency questionnaires administered over timemultivariate relative risks rrs and 95 cis were estimated by using cox proportional hazards models with control for potential confounders including detailed smoking historyresults men and women with a high intake of bacon 5 servingswk had an elevated risk of bladder cancer compared with those who never ate bacon multivariate rr  159 95 ci  106 237 although the overall association was not statistically significant p for trend  006however the association with bacon was stronger and became statistically significant after the removal of individuals who indicated having greatly changed their red meat men or bacon women intake during the 10 y before baseline multivariate rr  210 95 ci  124 355 p for trend  0006a positive association was also detected for intake of chicken without skin but not for chicken with skin or for other meats including processed meats hot dogs and hamburgersconclusions in these 2 cohorts combined frequent consumption of bacon was associated with an elevated risk of bladder cancerother studies with data on specific meat items are necessary to confirm our findings
