recent casecontrol studies suggested that dairy product consumption is an important risk factor for testicular cancerwe examined the association between consumption of dairy products especially milk milk fat and galactose and testicular cancer in a populationbased casecontrol study including 269 case and 797 controls response proportions of 76 and 46 respectivelydietary history was assessed by food frequency questions for the index persons and through their mothers including diet 1 year before interview and diet at age 17 yearswe used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios as estimates of the relative risk rr 95 confidence intervals 95 ci and to control for social status and heightthe rr of testicular cancer was 137 95 ci 112168 per additional 20 servings of milk per month each 200 ml in adolescencethis elevated overall risk was mainly due to an increased risk for seminoma rr 166 95 ci 130212 per additional 20 milk servings per monththe rr for seminoma was 130 95 ci 115148 for each additional 200 g milk fat per month and was 201 95 ci 141286 for each additional 200 g galactose per month during adolescenceour results suggest that milk fat andor galactose may explain the association between milk and dairy product consumption and seminomatous testicular cancer
