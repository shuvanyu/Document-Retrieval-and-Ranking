to investigate the association between dietary exposure to food mutagens and risk of pancreatic cancer we conducted a hospitalbased casecontrol study at the university of texas m d anderson cancer center during june 2002 to may 2006atotal of 626 cases and 530 noncancer controls were frequency matched for race sex and age 5 yearsdietary exposure information was collected via personal interview using a meat preparation questionnairea significantly greater portion of the cases than controls showed a preference to welldone pork bacon grilled chicken and panfried chicken but not to hamburger and steakcases had a higher daily intake of food mutagens and mutagenicity activity revertants per gram of daily meat intake than controls didthe daily intakes of 2amino348trimethylimidazo45fquinoxaline dimeiqx and benzoapyrene bap as well as the mutagenic activity were significant predictors for pancreatic cancer p  0008 0031 and 0029 respectively with adjustment of other confoundersa significant trend of elevated cancer risk with increasing dimeiqx intake was observed in quintile analysis ptrend 0024ahigher intake of dietary mutagens those in the two top quintiles was associated with a 2fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer among those without a family history of cancer but not among those with a family history of cancerapossible synergistic effect of dietary mutagen exposure and smoking was observed among individuals with the highest level of exposure top 10 to phip and bap pinteraction 009 and 0099 respectivelythese data support the hypothesis that dietary mutagen exposure alone and in interaction with other factors contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer
