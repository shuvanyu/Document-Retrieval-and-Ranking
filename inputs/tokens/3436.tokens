the incidence of colorectal cancer crc is dramatically higher in african americans aas than in native africans nas 60100000 vs 1100000 and slightly higher than in caucasian americans casto explore whether the difference could be explained by interactions between diet and colonic bacterial flora we compared randomly selected samples of healthy 50 to 65yold aas n  17 with nas n  18 and cas n  17diet was measured by 3d recall and colonic metabolism by breath hydrogen and methane responses to oral lactulosefecal samples were cultured for 7alpha dehydroxylating bacteria and lactobacillus plantarumcolonoscopic mucosal biopsies were taken to measure proliferation ratesin comparison with nas aas consumed more p  001 protein 94  93 vs 58  41 gd and fat 114  112 vs 38  30 gd meat saturated fat and cholesterolhowever they also consumed more p  005 calcium vitamin a and vitamin c and fiber intake was the samebreath hydrogen was higher p  00001 and methane lower in aas and fecal colony counts of 7alpha dehydroxylating bacteria were higher and of lactobacilli were lowercolonic crypt cell proliferation rates were dramatically higher in aas 218  11 vs 32  08 labeling p  00001in conclusion the higher crc risk and mucosal proliferation rates in aas than in nas were associated with higher dietary intakes of animal products and higher colonic populations of potentially toxic hydrogen and secondary bilesaltproducing bacteriathis supports our hypothesis that crc risk is determined by interactions between the external dietary and internal bacterial environments
