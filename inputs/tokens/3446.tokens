objective to investigate whether the rarity of colon cancer in black africans prevalence  1100000 can be accounted for by dietary factors considered to reduce risk and by differences in colonic bacterial fermentationmethods samples of the adult black south african population were drawn from several rural and urban regionsfood consumption was assessed by home visits food frequency questionnaires computerized analysis of 72h dietary recall and blood samplingcolonic fermentation was measured by breath h2 and ch4 response to a traditional meal and to 10g of lactulosecancer risk was estimated by measurement of epithelial proliferation indices ki67 and brdu in rectal mucosal biopsiesresults were evaluated by comparison to measurements in highrisk white south africans prevalence 17100000results epithelial proliferation was significantly lower in rural and urban blacks than whitesthe diets of all the black subgroups were characterized by a low animal product and high boiled maizemeal content whereas whites consumed more fresh animal products cheese and wheat productsblacks consumed below rda quantities of fiber 43 of rda vitamin a 78 c 62 folic acid 80 and calcium 67 whereas whites consumed more animal protein 177 of rda and fat 153fasting and foodinduced breath methane production was two to three times higher in blacksconclusions the low prevalence of colon cancer in black africans cannot be explained by dietary protective factors such as fiber calcium vitamins a c and folic acid but may be influenced by the absence of aggressive factors such as excess animal protein and fat and by differences in colonic bacterial fermentation
