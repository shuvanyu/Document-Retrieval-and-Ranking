purpose to identify if wholebody hydration plays an important role in dry eye dewe hypothesized that individuals classified as de have higher plasma osmolality posm indicating suboptimal hydration compared with those classified as nondemethods using a hospitalbased observational crosssectional design assessment of de and hydration was performed upon admission in 111 participants n  56 males and 55 females mean  sd age 77  8 yearsassessments of de included tear osmolarity tosm the 5item dry eye questionnaire deq5 rating of eye dryness using a visual analogue scale vas and noninvasive tear film breakup time nitbuthydration assessment was performed by measuring posm using freezingpoint depression osmometryresults posm was higher in de than control con indicating suboptimal hydration when using the 316 mosml tosm cutoff for de mean posm  11 mosmkg versus con p  0004 cohens effect size d  083 and the more conservative tosm classification for de where tosm 324 and con 308 mosml mean posm  12 mosmkg versus con p  0006 d  094posm was also higher in de than con when using composite de assessments including tosm and deq5 p  0021 d  107 tosm and nitbut p  0013 d  108 and the vas and deq5 p  0034 d  058conclusions these are the first published data to show that individuals classified as de have higher posm indicating suboptimal hydration compared with nondethese findings indicate that wholebody hydration is an important consideration in de
