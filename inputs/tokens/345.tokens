objectives to determine the quantitative efficacy of different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing coronary heart disease chd and stroke and who should receive treatmentdesign metaanalysisdata source medline 19662007study selection randomised trials of blood pressure lowering drugs recording chd events and strokes108 trials studied differences in blood pressure between study drug and placebo or control group not receiving the study drug blood pressure difference trials and 46 trials compared drugs drug comparison trialsseven trials with three randomised groups fell into both categoriesthe results were interpreted in the context of those expected from the largest published metaanalysis of cohort studies totalling 958 000 peopleparticipants 464 000 people defined into three mutually exclusive categories participants with no history of vascular disease a history of chd or a history of strokeresults in the blood pressure difference trials β blockers had a special effect over and above that due to blood pressure reduction in preventing recurrent chd events in people with a history of chd risk reduction 29 95 confidence interval 22 to 34 compared with 15 11 to 19 in trials of other drugsthe extra effect was limited to a few years after myocardial infarction with a risk reduction of 31 compared with 13 in people with chd with no recent infarct p004in the other blood pressure difference trials excluding chd events in trials of β blockers in people with chd there was a 22 reduction in chd events 17 to 27 and a 41 33 to 48 reduction in stroke for a blood pressure reduction of 10 mm hg systolic or 5 mm hg diastolic similar to the reductions of 25 chd and 36 stroke expected for the same difference in blood pressure from the cohort study metaanalysis indicating that the benefit is explained by blood pressure reduction itselfthe five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs thiazides β blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers were similarly effective within a few percentage points in preventing chd events and strokes with the exception that calcium channel blockers had a greater preventive effect on stroke relative risk 092 95 confidence interval 085 to 098the percentage reductions in chd events and stroke were similar in people with and without cardiovascular disease and regardless of blood pressure before treatment down to 110 mm hg systolic and 70 mm hg diastoliccombining our results with those from two other studies the metaanalyses of blood pressure cohort studies and of trials determining the blood pressure lowering effects of drugs according to dose showed that in people aged 6069 with a diastolic blood pressure before treatment of 90 mm hg three drugs at half standard dose in combination reduced the risk of chd by an estimated 46 and of stroke by 62 one drug at standard dose had about half this effectthe present metaanalysis also showed that drugs other than calcium channel blockers with the exception of noncardioselective β blockers reduced the incidence of heart failure by 24 19 to 28 and calcium channel blockers by 19 6 to 31conclusions with the exception of the extra protective effect of β blockers given shortly after a myocardial infarction and the minor additional effect of calcium channel blockers in preventing stroke all the classes of blood pressure lowering drugs have a similar effect in reducing chd events and stroke for a given reduction in blood pressure so excluding material pleiotropic effectsthe proportional reduction in cardiovascular disease events was the same or similar regardless of pretreatment blood pressure and the presence or absence of existing cardiovascular diseaseguidelines on the use of blood pressure lowering drugs can be simplified so that drugs are offered to people with all levels of blood pressureour results indicate the importance of lowering blood pressure in everyone over a certain age rather than measuring it in everyone and treating it in some
