summary background statins reduce ldl cholesterol and prevent vascular events but their net effects in people at low risk of vascular events remain uncertainmethods this metaanalysis included individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control n134 537 mean ldl cholesterol difference 108 mmoll median followup 48 years and five trials of more versus less statin n39 612 difference 051 mmoll 51 yearsmajor vascular events were major coronary events ie nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death strokes or coronary revascularisationsparticipants were separated into five categories of baseline 5year major vascular event risk on control therapy no statin or lowintensity statin 5 5 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 in each the rate ratio rr per 10 mmoll ldl cholesterol reduction was estimatedfindings reduction of ldl cholesterol with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events rr 079 95 ci 077081 per 10 mmoll reduction largely irrespective of age sex baseline ldl cholesterol or previous vascular disease and of vascular and allcause mortalitythe proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories rr per 10 mmoll reduction from lowest to highest risk 062 99 ci 047081 069 99 ci 060079 079 99 ci 074085 081 99 ci 077086 and 079 99 ci 074084 trend p004 which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events rr 057 99 ci 036089 p00012 and 061 99 ci 050074 p00001 and in coronary revascularisations rr 052 99 ci 035075 and 063 99 ci 051079 both p00001for stroke the reduction in risk in participants with 5year risk of major vascular events lower than 10 rr per 10 mmoll ldl cholesterol reduction 076 99 ci 061095 p00012 was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories trend p03in participants without a history of vascular disease statins reduced the risks of vascular rr per 10 mmoll ldl cholesterol reduction 085 95 ci 077095 and allcause mortality rr 091 95 ci 085097 and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline riskthere was no evidence that reduction of ldl cholesterol with a statin increased cancer incidence rr per 10 mmoll ldl cholesterol reduction 100 95 ci 096104 cancer mortality rr 099 95 ci 093106 or other nonvascular mortalityinterpretation in individuals with 5year risk of major vascular events lower than 10 each 1 mmoll reduction in ldl cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 yearsthis benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of statin therapyunder present guidelines such individuals would not typically be regarded as suitable for ldllowering statin therapythe present report suggests therefore that these guidelines might need to be reconsideredfunding british heart foundation uk medical research council cancer research uk european community biomed programme australian national health and medical research council national heart foundation australia
