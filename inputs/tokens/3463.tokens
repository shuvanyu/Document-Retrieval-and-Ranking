aims the aim of this study was to compare the effects of calorierestricted vegetarian and conventional diabetic diets alone and in combination with exercise on insulin resistance visceral fat and oxidative stress markers in subjects with type 2 diabetesmethods a 24week randomized open parallel design was usedseventyfour patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either the experimental group n  37 which received a vegetarian diet or the control group n  37 which received a conventional diabetic dietboth diets were isocaloric calorie restricted 500 kcaldayall meals during the study were providedthe second 12 weeks of the diet were combined with aerobic exerciseparticipants were examined at baseline 12 weeks and 24 weeksprimary outcomes were insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic clamp volume of visceral and subcutaneous fat measured by magnetic resonance imaging and oxidative stress measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substancesanalyses were by intention to treatresults fortythree per cent of participants in the experimental group and 5 of participants in the control group reduced diabetes medication p  0001body weight decreased more in the experimental group than in the control group 62 kg 95 ci 66 to 53 vs 32 kg 95 ci 37 to 25 interaction group  time p  0001an increase in insulin sensitivity was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group 30 95 ci 24539 vs 20 95 ci 1425 p  004a reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fat was greater in the experimental group than in the control group p  0007 and p  002 respectivelyplasma adiponectin increased p  002 and leptin decreased p  002 in the experimental group with no change in the control groupvitamin c superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione increased in the experimental group p  0002 p  0001 and p  002 respectivelydifferences between groups were greater after the addition of exercise trainingchanges in insulin sensitivity and enzymatic oxidative stress markers correlated with changes in visceral fatconclusions a calorierestricted vegetarian diet had greater capacity to improve insulin sensitivity compared with a conventional diabetic diet over 24 weeksthe greater loss of visceral fat and improvements in plasma concentrations of adipokines and oxidative stress markers with this diet may be responsible for the reduction of insulin resistancethe addition of exercise training further augmented the improved outcomes with the vegetarian diet
