increased consumption of plant products is associated with lower chronic disease prevalencethis is attributed to the great diversity of healthy phytochemicals present in these foodsthe most investigated physiological effects have been their antioxidant anticarcinogenic hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic propertiesalthough less studied in humans some compounds were very early on shown to be lipotropic in animals ie the capacity to hasten the removal of fat from liver andor reduce hepatic lipid synthesis or deposits by mainly increasing phospholipid synthesis via the transmethylation pathway for triglyceriderich lipoprotein exportation from the liver and enhanced fatty acid Î²oxidation andor down and upregulation of genes involved in lipogenic and fatty acid oxidation enzyme synthesis respectivelythe main plant lipotropes are choline betaine myoinositol methionine and carnitinemagnesium niacin pantothenate and folates also indirectly support the overall lipotropic effectthe exhaustive review of rat studies investigating phytochemical effect on hepatic lipid metabolism suggests that some fatty acids acetic acid melatonin phytic acid some fiber compounds oligofructose resistant starch some phenolic acids flavonoids lignans stilbenes curcumin saponins coumarin some plant extracts and some solid foods may be lipotropichowever this remains to be confirmed in humans for whom intervention studies are practically nonexistentsupplemental materials are available for this articlego to the publishers online edition of critical reviews in food science and nutrition to view the free supplemental file
