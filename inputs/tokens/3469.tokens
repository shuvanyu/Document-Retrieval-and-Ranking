insulin resistance is a cardinal feature of type 2 diabetes and is characteristic of a wide range of other clinical and experimental settingslittle is known about why insulin resistance occurs in so many contextsdo the various insults that trigger insulin resistance act through a common mechanismor as has been suggested do they use distinct cellular pathwayshere we report a genomic analysis of two cellular models of insulin resistance one induced by treatment with the cytokine tumournecrosis factoralpha and the other with the glucocorticoid dexamethasonegene expression analysis suggests that reactive oxygen species ros levels are increased in both models and we confirmed this through measures of cellular redox stateros have previously been proposed to be involved in insulin resistance although evidence for a causal role has been scantwe tested this hypothesis in cell culture using six treatments designed to alter ros levels including two small molecules and four transgenes all ameliorated insulin resistance to varying degreesone of these treatments was tested in obese insulinresistant mice and was shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasistogether our findings suggest that increased ros levels are an important trigger for insulin resistance in numerous settings
