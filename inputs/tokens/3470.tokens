plasma free fatty acid ffa levels are elevated in obesityffa by causing insulin resistance in muscle liver and endothelial cells contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm hypertension dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldthe mechanism through which ffa induces insulin resistance involves intramyocellular and intrahepatocellular accumulation of triglycerides and diacylglycerol activation of several serinethreonine kinases reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate irs12 and impairment of the irsphosphatidylinositol 3kinase pathway of insulin signalingffa also produces lowgrade inflammation in skeletal muscle and liver through activation of nuclear factorkappab resulting in release of several proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokinesthus elevated ffa levels due to obesity or to highfat feeding cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver which contributes to the development of t2dm and produce lowgrade inflammation which contributes to the development of atherosclerotic vascular diseases and nafld
