endogenous advanced glycation endproducts ages include chemically crosslinking species glycotoxins that contribute to the vascular and renal complications of diabetes mellitus dmrenal excretion of the catabolic products of endogenous ages is impaired in patients with diabetic or nondiabetic kidney disease kdthe aim of this study was to examine the oral absorption and renal clearance kinetics of food ages in dm with kd and whether circulating dietderived ages contain active glycotoxinsthirtyeight diabetics dm with or without kd and five healthy subjects nl received a single meal of egg white 56 g protein cooked with agediet or without fructose 100 g cldietserum and urine samples collected for 48 hr were monitored for age immunoreactivity by elisa and for agespecific crosslinking reactivity based on complex formation with 125ilabeled fibronectinthe agediet but not the cldiet produced distinct elevations in serum age levels in direct proportion to amount ingested r  08 p  005 the area under the curve for serum 10 of ingested age correlated directly with severity of kd renal excretion of dietary age although normally incomplete only 30 of amount absorbed in dm it correlated inversely with degree of albuminuria and directly with creatinine clearance r  08 p  005 reduced to 5 in dm with renal failurepostagemeal serum exhibited increased agecrosslinking activity two times above baseline serum age three times above negative control which was inhibited by aminoguanidinein conclusion i the renal excretion of orally absorbed ages is markedly suppressed in diabetic nephropathy patients ii daily influx of dietary ages includes glycotoxins that may constitute an added chronic risk for renalvascular injury in dm and iii dietary restriction of age food intake may greatly reduce the burden of ages in diabetic patients and possibly improve prognosis
