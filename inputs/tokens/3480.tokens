purpose the data on the association between coffee consumption and the risk of fractures are inconclusivewe performed a comprehensive literature review and metaanalysis to better quantify this associationmethods we identified all potentially relevant articles by searching medline embase cochrane library web of science scopus and cinahl until february 2013the keywords coffee caffeine drink and beverage were used as the exposure factors and the keyword fracture was used as the outcome factorwe determined the overall relative risk rr and confidence interval ci for the highest and lowest levels of coffee consumptiona doseresponse analysis was performed to assess the risk of fractures based on the level of coffee consumptionresults we included 253514 participants with 12939 fracture cases from 9 cohort and 6 casecontrol studiesthe estimated rr of fractures at the highest level of coffee consumption was 114 95 ci 105124 i200 in women and 076 95 ci 062094 i273 in menin the doseresponse analysis the pooled rrs of fractures in women who consumed 2 and 8 cups of coffee per day were 102 95 ci 101104 and 154 95 ci 119199 respectivelyconclusions our metaanalysis suggests that daily consumption of coffee is associated with an increased risk of fractures in women and a contrasting decreased risk in menhowever future welldesigned studies should be performed to confirm these findingscopyright  2014 elsevier inc all rights reserved
