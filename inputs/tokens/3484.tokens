purpose we investigated whether caffeine which transiently increases intraocular pressure iop is associated with risk of primary openangle glaucoma poagmethods we followed 79120 women from 1980 and 42052 men from 1986 to 2004 who were 40 years old did not have poag and reported receiving eye examinationsinformation on caffeine consumption potential confounders and poag diagnoses were repeatedly updated in validated followup questionnaireswe confirmed 1011 incident poag cases with medical record reviewcohortspecific and pooled analyses across cohorts were conducted to calculate multivariable rate ratios rrresults compared with daily intake of  150 mg the pooled multivariable rrs were 105 95 confidence interval ci 089125 for consuming 150299 mg 119 95 ci 099143 for 300  449 mgday 113 95 ci 089143 for 450559 mg and 117 95 ci 090 153 for 600 mg p for trend  011however for consuming 5 cups of caffeinated coffee daily rr was 161 95 ci 100 259 p for trend002 tea or caffeinated cola intake were not associated with riskgreater caffeine intake was more adversely associated with poag among those reporting family history of glaucoma particularly in relation to poag with elevated iop p for trend 00009 pinteraction004conclusion overall caffeine intake was not associated with increased risk of poaghowever in secondary analyses caffeine appeared to elevate risk of hightension poag among those with a family history of glaucoma this may be due to chance but warrants further study
