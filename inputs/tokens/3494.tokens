background the present analysis was conducted in response to inconsistent epidemiologic studies on the relation between consumption of tea and cardiovascular diseasesobjective we undertook a literature review of the consistency and strength of the associations between tea and cardiovascular diseases on the basis of published observational studies and metaanalyses addressing tea or tea flavonoids and cardiovascular disease riskdesign we performed a search in 3 databases for metaanalyses and compared them with studies they subsumedwe performed an additional search for subsequent studies to determine whether the conclusions were consistentresults many epidemiologic studies have been conducted and summarized in 5 metaanalyses on either tea consumption or flavonoid consumption and cardiovascular disease or the subset of strokeheterogeneity of effect was seen when the outcome included all cardiovascular diseasesin the case of stroke a consistent doseresponse association with tea consumption on both incidence and mortality was noted with rrs of 080 95 ci 065 098 for flavonoids and 079 95 ci 073 085 for tea when high and low intakes were compared or the addition of 3 cupsd was estimatedconclusion thus the strength of this evidence supports the hypothesis that tea consumption might lower the risk of stroke
