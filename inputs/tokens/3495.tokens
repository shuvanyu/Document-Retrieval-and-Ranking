background coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages but the association between coffee consumption and the risk of death remains unclearmethods we examined the association of coffee drinking with subsequent total and causespecific mortality among 229119 men and 173141 women in the national institutes of healthaarp diet and health study who were 50 to 71 years of age at baselineparticipants with cancer heart disease and stroke were excludedcoffee consumption was assessed once at baselineresults during 5148760 personyears of followup between 1995 and 2008 a total of 33731 men and 18784 women diedin ageadjusted models the risk of death was increased among coffee drinkershowever coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke and after adjustment for tobaccosmoking status and other potential confounders there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortalityadjusted hazard ratios for death among men who drank coffee as compared with those who did not were as follows 099 95 confidence interval ci 095 to 104 for drinking less than 1 cup per day 094 95 ci 090 to 099 for 1 cup 090 95 ci 086 to 093 for 2 or 3 cups 088 95 ci 084 to 093 for 4 or 5 cups and 090 95 ci 085 to 096 for 6 or more cups of coffee per day p0001 for trend the respective hazard ratios among women were 101 95 ci 096 to 107 095 95 ci 090 to 101 087 95 ci 083 to 092 084 95 ci 079 to 090 and 085 95 ci 078 to 093 p0001 for trendinverse associations were observed for deaths due to heart disease respiratory disease stroke injuries and accidents diabetes and infections but not for deaths due to cancerresults were similar in subgroups including persons who had never smoked and persons who reported very good to excellent health at baselineconclusions in this large prospective study coffee consumption was inversely associated with total and causespecific mortalitywhether this was a causal or associational finding cannot be determined from our datafunded by the intramural research program of the national institutes of health national cancer institute division of cancer epidemiology and genetics
