objectiveto examine the acute effects of consumption of monounsaturated mufas and saturated fatty acids safas on endothelial function in subjects with type 2 diabetesresearch design and methodsa total of 33 participants were examined after consumption of two different isocaloric meals one rich in mufa and one rich in safa in the form of extravirgin olive oil and butter respectivelyendothelial function was assessed by determination of flowmediated dilatation fmdresultsfmd did not change significantly after the mufarich meal but declined after the safarich mealthe fmd during the experiment expressed as incremental area under the curve increased after the mufarich meal by 52  25 and decreased after the safarich meal by 167  60 Î´  115  64 p  0008conclusionsconsumption of an safarich meal is harmful for the endothelium while a mufarich meal does not impair endothelial function in subjects with type 2 diabetes
