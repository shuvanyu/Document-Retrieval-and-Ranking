background persons following current dietary guidelines have a lower risk of mortality from coronary heart diseaseobjective the objective was to compare the shortterm effect of a highfat meal and a highcarbohydrate meal with and without dietary antioxidants on vasomotor antiplatelet and hemostatic functions of the endothelium in healthy subjectsdesign in an observerblinded randomized crossover study 25 13 men and 12 women healthy subjects were given each of 3 meals in random order at 1wk intervals a highfat meal 760 kcal an isoenergetic highcarbohydrate meal and a highfat meal with dietary antioxidants from vegetables 865 kcalendothelial functions as assessed by hemodynamic and rheologic responses to largininethe natural precursor of nitric oxidewere evaluated before and 4 h after each mealresults unlike the highcarbohydrate meal the highfat meal increased the plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol p  001 both meals activated hemostasisthe highcarbohydrate meal did not modify blood pressure and platelet aggregation decreased in response to the larginine load 71  23 mm hg and 85  45 respectivelyafter the highfat meal the decrease in blood pressure in response to larginine was reduced 1  08 mm hg and platelet aggregation showed a paradoxical increase 41  21 p  001 compared with the highcarbohydrate mealthe highfat meal with antioxidants partially restored the vascular response to larginineconclusion compared with a highcarbohydrate meal a highfat meal can modify endothelial functions toward a more atherogenetic profile which is partially prevented by dietary antioxidants
