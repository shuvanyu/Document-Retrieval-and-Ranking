background the regulatory function of the endothelium is altered in hypercholesterolemia and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosisobjective to determine whether endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients is affected by replacing a saturated fatenriched diet with a lowfat lowsaturated fat diet the us national cholesterol education program stage 1 ncep1 diet or a diet rich in monounsaturated fat such as that common in mediterranean countriesdesign intervention dietary study with a baseline phase and two randomized crossover dietary periodssetting hospital universitario reina sofía córdoba spainpatients 22 hypercholesterolemic menintervention patients followed a diet high in saturated fat then were assigned in a crossover design to the ncep1 diet or a mediterranean dieteach dietary period lasted 28 daysmeasurements plasma pselectin levels lipid concentrations and endothelial functionresults compared with the saturated fat diet flowmediated dilatation increased during the mediterranean diet but not during the ncep1 dietin addition levels of plasma cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol apolipoprotein b and pselectin decreased during the ncep1 and mediterranean dietsconclusion in hypercholesterolemic men diets low in fat especially saturated fat and diets rich in monounsaturated fats improve endothelial function
