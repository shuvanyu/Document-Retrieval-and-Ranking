olive oil is well known for its cardioprotective properties however epidemiological data showing that olive oil consumption reduces incident chd events are still limitedtherefore we studied the association between olive oil and chd in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic spanish cohort studythe analysis included 40 142 participants 38  male free of chd events at baseline recruited from five epicspain centres from 1992 to 1996 and followed up until 2004baseline dietary and lifestyle information was collected using interviewadministered questionnairescox proportional regression models were used to assess the relationship between validated incident chd events and olive oil intake energyadjusted quartiles and each 10 gd per 8368 kj 2000 kcal increment while adjusting for potential confoundersduring a 104year followup 587 79  male chd events were recordedolive oil intake was negatively associated with chd risk after excluding dietary misreporters hazard ratio hr 093 95  ci 087 100 for each 10 gd per 8368 kj 2000 kcal and hr 078 95  ci 059 103 for upper v lower quartilethe inverse association between olive oil intake per 10 gd per 8368 kj 2000 kcal and chd was more pronounced in never smokers 11  reduced chd risk p  0048 in neverlow alcohol drinkers 25  reduced chd risk p  0001 and in virgin olive oil consumers 14  reduced chd risk p  0072in conclusion olive oil consumption was related to a reduced risk of incident chd eventsthis emphasises the need to conserve the traditional culinary use of olive oil within the mediterranean diet to reduce the chd burden
