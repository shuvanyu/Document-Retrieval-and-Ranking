abnormalities in endothelial function may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk in diabetic patientswe examined the effect of an oleicacidrich diet on insulin resistance and endotheliumdependent vasoreactivity in type 2 diabeteseleven type 2 diabetic patients were changed from their usual linoleicacidrich diet and treated for 2 months with an oleicacidrich dietinsulinmediated glucose transport was measured in isolated adipocytesfatty acid composition of the adipocyte membranes was determined by gasliquid chromatography and flowmediated endotheliumdependent and independent vasodilatation were measured in the superficial femoral artery at the end of each dietary periodthere was a significant increase in oleic acid and a decrease in linoleic acid on the oleicacidrich diet p00001diabetic control was not different between the diets but there was a small but significant decrease in fasting glucoseinsulin on the oleicacidrich dietinsulinstimulated 1 ngml glucose transport was significantly greater on the oleic acidrich diet 056017 vs 029014 nmol105 cells3 min p00001endotheliumdependent flowmediated vasodilatation fmd was significantly greater on the oleicacidrich diet 390097 vs 612136 p00001there was a significant correlation between adipocyte membrane oleiclinoleic acid and insulinmediated glucose transport p0001 but no relationship between insulinstimulated glucose transport and change in endotheliumdependent fmdthere was a significant positive correlation between adipocyte membrane oleiclinoleic acid and endotheliumdependent fmd r061 p0001change from polyunsaturated to monounsaturated diet in type 2 diabetes reduced insulin resistance and restored endotheliumdependent vasodilatation suggesting an explanation for the antiatherogenic benefits of a mediterraneantype diet
