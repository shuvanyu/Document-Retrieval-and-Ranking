objectives this study investigated the postprandial effect of components of the mediterranean diet on endothelial function which may be an atherogenic factorbackground the mediterranean diet containing olive oil pasta fruits vegetables fish and wine is associated with an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular eventsthe lyon diet heart study found that a mediterranean diet which substituted omega3fattyacidenriched canola oil for the traditionally consumed omega9 fattyacidrich olive oil reduced cardiovascular eventsmethods we fed 10 healthy normolipidemic subjects five meals containing 900 kcal and 50 g fatthree meals contained different fat sources olive oil canola oil and salmontwo olive oil meals also contained antioxidant vitamins c and e or foods balsamic vinegar and saladwe measured serum lipoproteins and glucose and brachial artery flowmediated vasodilation fmd an index of endothelial function before and 3 h after each mealresults all five meals significantly raised serum triglycerides but did not change other lipoproteins or glucose 3 h postprandiallythe olive oil meal reduced fmd 31 143  42 to 99  45 p  0008an inverse correlation was observed between postprandial changes in serum triglycerides and fmd r  047 p  005the remaining four meals did not significantly reduce fmdconclusions in terms of their postprandial effect on endothelial function the beneficial components of the mediterranean and lyon diet heart study diets appear to be antioxidantrich foods including vegetables fruits and their derivatives such as vinegar and omega3rich fish and canola oils
