background olive oil polyphenols have been associated with several cardiovascular health benefitsthis study aims to examine the influence of a polyphenolrich olive oil on blood pressure bp and endothelial function in 24 young women with highnormal bp or stage 1 essential hypertensionmethods we conducted a doubleblind randomized crossover dietaryintervention studyafter a runin period of 4 months baseline values two diets were used one with polyphenolrich olive oil 30 mgday the other with polyphenolfree olive oileach dietary period lasted 2 months with a 4week washout between dietssystolic and diastolic bp serum or plasma biomarkers of endothelial function oxidative stress and inflammation and ischemiainduced hyperemia in the forearm were measuredresults when compared to baseline values only the polyphenolrich olive oil diet led to a significant p  001 decrease of 791 mm hg in systolic and 665 mm hg of diastolic bpa similar finding was found for serum asymmetric dimethylarginine adma 009  001 µmoll p  001 oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein oxldl 282  285 µgl p  001 and plasma creactive protein crp 19  13 mgl p  0001the polyphenolrich olive oil diet also elicited an increase in plasma nitritesnitrates 47  66 µmoll p  0001 and hyperemic area after ischemia 345  386 perfusion units pusec p  0001conclusions we concluded that the consumption of a diet containing polyphenolrich olive oil can decrease bp and improve endothelial function in young women with highnormal bp or stage 1 essential hypertension
