in recent years endothelial dysfunction has been identified as an early feature of atherosclerosisendothelial function can be measured noninvasively by using brachial artery ultrasounda variety of factors associated with atherosclerosis also impair endothelial functionsome of these factors are lipoproteins such as various forms of lowdensity lipoproteins postprandial chylomicron remnants fasting triglyceriderich particles and free fatty acidsa highfat diet also has an adverse effect on endothelial functionseveral interventions can improve endothelial function and at the same time reduce cardiovascular eventsmeasuring endothelial function may eventually serve as a useful index to determine an individuals risk for coronary artery disease
