objective to determine the effect of postprandial lipid changes on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease cad after a highfat mealmethods we studied 50 cad patients and 25 control participants who were all normocholesterolemicflowmediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery was evaluated by the highresolution ultrasound technique before and after a single highfat meal 800 calories 50 g fatresults postprandial serum triglyceride level increased significantly at 27 h and mean flowmediated vasodilatation was impaired significantly from 422  044 to 275  033 p  001 for 75 subjectsthe increment in 2 h serum triglyceride level correlated positively with the decrement in postprandial flowmediated vasodilatation r  0459 p  001postprandial triglyceride level was significantly higher in cad patients than in control participantsflowmediated vasodilatation was significantly impaired in cad patients from 304  039 to 169  023 p  001 and control participants from 658  052 to 487  019 p  005 after a highfat mealthe impairment of flowmediated dilatation was more severe in cad patients 4441 than in control participants 2599 p  001conclusion postprandial endotheliumdependent vasodilatation after a single highfat meal was severely impaired in normocholesterolemic cad patients and control participantsthe disordered postprandial metabolism of triglyceriderich lipoproteins may play an atherogenic role by inducing endothelial dysfunction
