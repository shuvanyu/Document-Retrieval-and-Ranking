background hypertriglyceridemia is now accepted as a risk factor for coronary heart disease although the mechanism behind the increased risk is not well understoodthe present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of triglyceridemia on endothelial function because impaired endothelial function is considered a marker of atherogenesismethods and results flow and nitroglycerininduced dilatation of the brachial artery was investigated noninvasively by highresolution ultrasound technique in seven young healthy men without risk factors for coronary heart diseasetransient triglyceridemia was induced by infusion of a triglyceride emulsion intralipid which raised free fatty acid concentrations twofold and triglyceride levels fourfoldflowinduced vasodilatation decreased from 7130 to 1626 p0002 whereas nitroglycerininduced vasodilatation decreased from 20558 to 11532 p002 before and after 1 hour of infusion of intralipid respectivelyconclusions transient triglyceridemia decreases vascular reactivity presumably by both endotheliumdependent and endotheliumindependent mechanisms
