oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depression etcboth genetic and nongenetic factors have been found to cause increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species beyond the capacity of antioxidant defense mechanism in patients of psychiatric disordersthese factors trigger oxidative cellular damage to lipids proteins and dna leading to abnormal neural growth and differentiationtherefore novel therapeutic strategies such as supplementation with antioxidants can be effective for longterm treatment management of neuropsychiatric disordersthe use of antioxidants and pufas as supplements in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders has provided some promising resultsat the same time one should be cautious with the use of antioxidants since excessive antioxidants could dangerously interfere with some of the protective functions of reactive oxygen speciesthe present article will give an overview of the potential strategies and outcomes of using antioxidants as therapeutics in psychiatric disorders
