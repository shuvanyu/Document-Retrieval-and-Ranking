high blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events worldwideclinical and epidemiological studies suggest that cocoarich products reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseaseaccording to this cocoa has a high content in polyphenols especially flavanolsflavanols have been described to exert favorable effects on endotheliumderived vasodilation via the stimulation of nitric oxidesynthase the increased availability of larginine and the decreased degradation of nococoa may also have a beneficial effect by protecting against oxidative stress alterations and via decreased platelet aggregation decreased lipid oxidation and insulin resistancethese effects are associated with a decrease of blood pressure and a favorable trend toward a reduction in cardiovascular events and strokesprevious metaanalyses have shown that cocoarich foods may reduce blood pressurelongterm trials investigating the effect of cocoa products are needed to determine whether or not blood pressure is reduced on a chronic basis by daily ingestion of cocoafurthermore longterm trials investigating the effect of cocoa on clinical outcomes are also needed to assess whether cocoa has an effect on cardiovascular eventsa 3 mmhg systolic blood pressure reduction has been estimated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular and allcause mortalitythis paper summarizes new findings concerning cocoa effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular health focusing on putative mechanisms of action and nutraceutical  viewpoints
