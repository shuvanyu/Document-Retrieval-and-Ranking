background dark chocolate may have blood pressurelowering propertieswe conducted a prospective randomized openlabel blinded endpoint design trial to study a potential dose dependency of the presumed antihypertensive effect of dark chocolate by directly comparing low vs higher doses of dark chocolate over the course of 3 monthsmethods we enrolled a total of 102 patients with prehypertensionstage 1 hypertension and established cardiovascular endorgan damage or diabetes mellituspatients were randomly assigned to receive either 6 or 25 gday of flavanolrich dark chocolate for 3 monthsthe difference in 24h mean blood pressure between groups was defined as the primary outcome measureresults significant reductions in mean ambulatory 24h blood pressure were observed between baseline and followup in both groups 6 gday 23 mm hg 95 confidence interval 41 to 04 25 gday 19 mm hg 95 confidence interval 36 to 02there were no significant differences in blood pressure changes between groupsin the higherdose group a slight increase in body weight was noted 08 kg 95 confidence interval 006 to 16conclusions the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dark chocolate may be associated with a reduction in blood pressure bphowever due to the lack of a control group confounding may be possible and the results should be interpreted with caution
