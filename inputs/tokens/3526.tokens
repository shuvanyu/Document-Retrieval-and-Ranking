objective to determine whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved in trials of dietary salt reduction is quantitatively consistent with estimates derived from blood pressure and sodium intake in different populations and if so to estimate the impact of reducing dietary salt on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart diseasedesign analysis of the results of 68 crossover trials and 10 randomised controlled trials of dietary salt reductionmain outcome measure comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysisresults in the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest durationin the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductionsthis applied for all age groups and for people with both high and normal levels of blood pressurein people aged 5059 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol about 3 g of salt attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would after a few weeks lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm hg and by 7 mm hg in those with high blood pressure 170 mm hg diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as muchit is estimated that such a reduction in salt intake by a whole western population would reduce the incidence of stroke by 22 and of ischaemic heart disease by 16 correctedconclusions the results from the trials support the estimates from the observational data in the accompanying two papersthe effect of universal moderate dietary salt reduction on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease would be substantiallarger indeed than could be achieved by fully implementing recommended policy for treating high blood pressure with drugshowever reduction also in the amount of salt added to processed foods would lower blood pressure by at least twice as much and prevent some 75000 corrected deaths a year in britain as well as much disability
