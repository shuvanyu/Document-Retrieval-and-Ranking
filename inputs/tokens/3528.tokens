the yanomamo indians are an unacculturated tribe inhabiting the tropical equatorial rain forest of northern brazil and southern venezuela who do not use salt in their dietthe group therefore presented an unusual opportunity to study the hormonal regulation of sodium metabolism in a culture with lifelong extreme restriction of dietary sodium with parallel observations on blood pressureblood pressures increased from the first to second decade but in constrast to civilized populations do not systematically increase during subsequent years of lifein twentyfour hour urine collections on adult male indians excretion of sodium averaged only 1 plus or minus 15 sd meqsimultaneous plasma renin activities were elevated and comparable to those of civilized subjects placed for brief periods on 10 meq sodium dietssimilarly excretion rates of aldosterone equaled those of acculturated subjects on low sodium dietsthe findings suggest that the hormonal adjustments to lifelong low sodium intakes are similar to those achieved in acute sodium restriction of civilized manparenthetically these elevated levels of aldosterone and renin were probably the norm for man during much of human evolution and suggest that the values observed in civilized controls are depressed by an excessive salt intake in contemporary diets
