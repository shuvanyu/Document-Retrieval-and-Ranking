summary background quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a diseasebydisease analysisno complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000 and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over timemethods we estimated deaths and disabilityadjusted life years dalys sum of years lived with disability yld and years of life lost yll attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010we estimated exposure distributions for each year region sex and age group and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished datawe used these estimates together with estimates of causespecific deaths and dalys from the global burden of disease study 2010 to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoreticalminimumrisk exposurewe incorporated uncertainty in disease burden relative risks and exposures into our estimates of attributable burdenfindings in 2010 the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure 70 95 uncertainty interval 6277 of global dalys tobacco smoking including secondhand smoke 63 5570 and alcohol use 55 5059in 1990 the leading risks were childhood underweight 79 6894 household air pollution from solid fuels hap 70 5683 and tobacco smoking including secondhand smoke 61 5468dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 100 95 ui 92108 of global dalys in 2010 with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodiumseveral risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies fell in rank between 1990 and 2010 with unimproved water we and sanitation accounting for 09 0416 of global dalys in 2010however in most of subsaharan africa childhood underweight hap and nonexclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010 while hap was the leading risk in south asiathe leading risk factor in eastern europe most of latin america and southern subsaharan africa in 2010 was alcohol use in most of asia north africa and middle east and central europe it was high blood pressuredespite declines tobacco smoking including secondhand smoke remained the leading risk in highincome north america and western europehigh bodymass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in australasia and southern latin america and also ranks high in other highincome regions north africa and middle east and oceaniainterpretation worldwide the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for noncommunicable diseases in adultsthese changes are related to the ageing population decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years changes in causeofdeath composition and changes in risk factor exposuresnew evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation vitamin a and zinc deficiencies and ambient particulate matter pollutionthe extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regionsin much of subsaharan africa the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect childrenfunding bill  melinda gates foundation
