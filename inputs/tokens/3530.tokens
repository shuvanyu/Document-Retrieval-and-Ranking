to determine serum lipid levels and their correlates in one of the worlds most isolated populations 62 adult yanomamo indians from the amazonian rain forest were examinedafter measurement of body weight and height and estimation of age casual blood samples were obtainedestimated age ranged from 20 to 68 years with men averaging 37 and women 35 yearsmean serum total cholesterol was very low among both men 123 mgdl and women 142 mgdl compared with western samples whereas triglycerides112 and 110 mgdl respectivelywere lower among men and slightly higher among women than for us men and womenyanomamo women had significantly higher total cholesterol p  002 and body mass index bmi p  005 than menhdlcholesterol p  008 and ldlcholesterol p  021 were also somewhat higher among womenmultivariate regression analysis indicated that estimated age was independently related to cholesterol in both sexes while bmi was of borderline significancethe very low serum lipid levels in this isolated population are apparently attributable mainly to their largely vegetarian diet low in fats and cholesterol and high in fiber with concomitant high physical activity associated with low bmi
