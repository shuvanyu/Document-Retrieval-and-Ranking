the plasma sodium concentration has a direct effect on blood pressure in addition to its effects on extracellular volume regulated through changes in the endotheliumthe mechanism for elevated blood pressure seen with habitually increased salt intake is unclear especially the effect of salt in a single meal on plasma sodium concentration and blood pressureto resolve this we compared the effect of soup with or without 6 g of salt an amount similar to that in a single meal on the plasma sodium concentration and blood pressure in 10 normotensive volunteers using a randomized crossover designthe plasma sodium concentration was significantly increased by 313075 mmoll with salted compared with unsalted soupblood pressure increased in volunteers ingesting soup with added salt and there was a significant positive correlation between plasma sodium concentration and systolic blood pressurea 1mmoll increase in plasma sodium was associated with a 191mm hg increase in systolic blood pressure by linear regressionthus changes in plasma sodium concentration occur each time a meal containing salt is consumeda potential mechanism for the changes in blood pressure seen with salt intake may be through its effects on plasma sodium concentration
