nineteen unselected patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension whose average supine blood pressure after two months observation on no treatment was 15698 mm hg were advised not to add salt to food and to avoid sodiumladen foodsafter 2 weeks of sodium restriction patients were entered into an 8week doubleblind randomised crossover study of slow sodium ciba versus slow sodium placebothe mean supine blood pressure was 71 mm hg 61 lower in the fourth week of placebo than that in the fourth week of slow sodium p less than 0001urinary sodium excretion in the fourth week of slow sodium was 162  9 mmol24 h and that in the fourth week of placebo was 86 mmol  9 mmol24 h p less than 0001there was no difference in potassium excretionthese results suggest that moderate sodium restriction achieved by not adding salt and avoiding sodiumladen foods should if not already become part of the management of essential hypertension
