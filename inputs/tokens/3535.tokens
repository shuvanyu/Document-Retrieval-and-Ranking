background knowledge of the number of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and priority settingour aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary lifestyle and metabolic risk factors in the united states us using consistent and comparable methods high blood glucose lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and blood pressure overweightobesity high dietary trans fatty acids and salt low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids omega3 fatty acids seafood and fruits and vegetables physical inactivity alcohol use and tobacco smokingmethods and findings we used data on risk factor exposures in the us population from nationally representative health surveys and diseasespecific mortality statistics from the national center for health statisticswe obtained the etiological effects of risk factors on diseasespecific mortality by age from systematic reviews and metaanalyses of epidemiological studies that had adjusted i for major potential confounders and ii where possible for regression dilution biaswe estimated the number of diseasespecific deaths attributable to all nonoptimal levels of each risk factor exposure by age and sexin 2005 tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an estimated 467000 95 confidence interval ci 436000500000 and 395000 372000414000 deaths accounting for about one in five or six deaths in us adultsoverweightobesity 216000 188000237000 and physical inactivity 191000 164000222000 were each responsible for nearly 1 in 10 deathshigh dietary salt 102000 97000107000 low dietary omega3 fatty acids 84000 7200096000 and high dietary trans fatty acids 82000 6300097000 were the dietary risks with the largest mortality effectsalthough 26000 2300040000 deaths from ischemic heart disease ischemic stroke and diabetes were averted by current alcohol use they were outweighed by 90000 8800094000 deaths from other cardiovascular diseases cancers liver cirrhosis pancreatitis alcohol use disorders road traffic and other injuries and violenceconclusions smoking and high blood pressure which both have effective interventions are responsible for the largest number of deaths in the usother dietary lifestyle and metabolic risk factors for chronic diseases also cause a substantial number of deaths in the usplease see later in the article for editors summary editors summary a number of modifiable factors are responsible for many premature or preventable deathsfor example being overweight or obese shortens life expectancy while half of all longterm tobacco smokers in western populations will die prematurely from a disease directly related to smokingmodifiable risk factors fall into three main groupsfirst there are lifestyle risk factorsthese include tobacco smoking physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use small amounts of alcohol may actually prevent diabetes and some types of heart disease and strokesecond there are dietary risk factors such as a high salt intake and a low intake of fruits and vegetablesfinally there are metabolic risk factors which shorten life expectancy by increasing a persons chances of developing cardiovascular disease in particular heart problems and strokes and diabetesmetabolic risk factors include having high blood pressure or blood cholesterol and being overweight or obesewhy was this study doneit should be possible to reduce preventable deaths by changing modifiable risk factors through introducing public health policies programs and regulations that reduce exposures to these risk factorshowever it is important to know how many deaths are caused by each risk factor before developing policies and programs that aim to improve a nations healthalthough previous studies have provided some information on the numbers of premature deaths caused by modifiable risk factors there are two problems with these studiesfirst they have not used consistent and comparable methods to estimate the number of deaths attributable to different risk factorssecond they have rarely considered the effects of dietary and metabolic risk factorsin this new study the researchers estimate the number of deaths due to 12 different modifiable dietary lifestyle and metabolic risk factors for the united states populationthey use a method called comparative risk assessment this approach estimates the number of deaths that would be prevented if current distributions of risk factor exposures were changed to hypothetical optimal distributionswhat did the researchers do and findthe researchers extracted data on exposures to these 12 selected risk factors from us national health surveys and they obtained information on deaths from difference diseases for 2005 from the us national center for health statisticsthey used previously published studies to estimate how much each risk factor increases the risk of death from each diseasethe researchers then used a mathematical formula to estimate the numbers of deaths caused by each risk factorof the 25 million us deaths in 2005 they estimate that nearly half a million were associated with tobacco smoking and about 400000 were associated with high blood pressurethese two risk factors therefore each accounted for about 1 in 5 deaths in us adultsoverweightobesity and physical inactivity were each responsible for nearly 1 in 10 deathsamong the dietary factors examined high dietary salt intake had the largest effect being responsible for 4 of deaths in adultsfinally while alcohol use prevented 26000 deaths from ischemic heart disease ischemic stroke and diabetes the researchers estimate that it caused 90000 deaths from other types of cardiovascular diseases other medical conditions and road traffic accidents and violencewhat do these findings meanthese findings indicate that smoking and high blood pressure are responsible for the largest number of preventable deaths in the us but that several other modifiable risk factors also cause many deathsalthough the accuracy of some of the estimates obtained in this study will be affected by the quality of the data used these findings suggest that targeting a handful of risk factors could greatly reduce premature mortality in the usthe findings might also apply to other countries although the risk factors responsible for most preventable deaths may vary between countriesimportantly effective individuallevel and populationwide interventions are already available to reduce peoples exposure to the two risk factors responsible for most preventable deaths in the usthe researchers also suggest that combinations of regulation pricing and education have the potential to reduce the exposure of us residents to other risk factors that are likely to shorten their livesadditional
