importance understanding the major health problems in the united states and how they are changing over time is critical for informing national health policyobjectives to measure the burden of diseases injuries and leading risk factors in the united states from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countriesdesign we used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the global burden of disease 2010 study to describe the health status of the united states and to compare us health outcomes with those of 34 oecd countriesyears of life lost due to premature mortality ylls were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that ageyears lived with disability ylds were calculated by multiplying prevalence based on systematic reviews by the disability weight based on populationbased surveys for each sequela disability in this study refers to any short or longterm loss of healthdisabilityadjusted lifeyears dalys were estimated as the sum of ylds and yllsdeaths and dalys related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and metaanalyses of exposure data and relative risks for riskoutcome pairshealthy life expectancy hale was used to summarize overall population health accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different agesresults us life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 752 years in 1990 to 782 years in 2010 during the same period hale increased from 658 years to 681 yearsthe diseases and injuries with the largest number of ylls in 2010 were ischemic heart disease lung cancer stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and road injuryagestandardized yll rates increased for alzheimer disease drug use disorders chronic kidney disease kidney cancer and fallsthe diseases with the largest number of ylds in 2010 were low back pain major depressive disorder other musculoskeletal disorders neck pain and anxiety disordersas the us population has aged ylds have comprised a larger share of dalys than have yllsthe leading risk factors related to dalys were dietary risks tobacco smoking high body mass index high blood pressure high fasting plasma glucose physical inactivity and alcohol useamong 34 oecd countries between 1990 and 2010 the us rank for the agestandardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th for the agestandardized yll rate from 23rd to 28th for the agestandardized yld rate from 5th to 6th for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th and for hale from 14th to 26thconclusions and relevance from 1990 to 2010 the united states made substantial progress in improving healthlife expectancy at birth and hale increased allcause death rates at all ages decreased and agespecific rates of years lived with disability remained stablehowever morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the us health burden and improvements in population health in the united states have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations
