purpose of review brown adipose tissue bat which is present in humans plays an important role in oxidation of fatty acids and glucosethe purpose of this review is to highlight an important role for larginine in regulating bat growth and development thereby reducing obesity in mammalsrecent findings dietary supplementation with larginine reduces white adipose tissue in genetically or dietinduced obese rats obese pregnant sheep and obese humans with type ii diabeteslarginine treatment enhances bat growth in both fetuses and postnatal animalsat molecular and cellular levels larginine stimulates expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorÎ³ coactivator 1 the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis nitric oxide synthase heme oxygenase and adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinaseat the whole body level larginine increases blood flow to insulinsensitive tissues adipose tissue lipolysis and the catabolism of glucose and fatty acids but inhibits fatty acid synthesis and ameliorates oxidative stress thereby improving metabolic profilesummary larginine increases mammalian bat growth and development via mechanisms involving gene expression nitric oxide signaling and protein synthesisthis enhances the oxidation of energy substrates and thus reduces white fat accretion in the bodylarginine holds great promise in preventing and treating obesity in humans
