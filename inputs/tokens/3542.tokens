we will review information about and present hypotheses as to the anatomy of brown adipose tissue batwhy is it located where it is in humansits anatomical distribution is likely to confer survival value by protecting critical organs from hypothermia by adaptive thermogenesisultimately the location and function will be important when considering therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating obesity and type 2 diabetes in which case successful interventions will need to have a significant effect on bat function in subjects living in a thermoneutral environmentin view of the diverse locations and potential differences in responsiveness between bat depots it is likely that bat will be shown to have much more subtle and thus previously overlooked functions and regulatory control mechanisms
