background addition of capsaicin caps to the diet has been shown to increase energy expenditure therefore capsaicin is an interesting target for antiobesity therapyaim we investigated the 24 h effects of caps on energy expenditure substrate oxidation and blood pressure during 25 negative energy balancemethods subjects underwent four 36 h sessions in a respiration chamber for measurements of energy expenditure substrate oxidation and blood pressurethey received 100 or 75 of their daily energy requirements in the conditions 100caps 100control 75caps and 75controlcaps was given at a dose of 256 mg 103 g of red chili pepper 39050 scoville heat units shu with every mealresults an induced negative energy balance of 25 was effectively a 205 negative energy balance due to adapting mechanismsdietinduced thermogenesis dit and resting energy expenditure ree at 75caps did not differ from dit and ree at 100control while at 75control these tended to be or were lower than at 100control p  005 and p  002 respectivelysleeping metabolic rate smr at 75caps did not differ from smr at 100caps while smr at 75control was lower than at 100caps p  004fat oxidation at 75caps was higher than at 100control p  003 while with 75control it did not differ from 100controlrespiratory quotient rq was more decreased at 75caps p  004 than at 75control p  005 when compared with 100controlblood pressure did not differ between the four conditionsconclusion in an effectively 205 negative energy balance consumption of 256 mg capsaicin per meal supports negative energy balance by counteracting the unfavorable negative energy balance effect of decrease in components of energy expendituremoreover consumption of 256 mg capsaicin per meal promotes fat oxidation in negative energy balance and does not increase blood pressure significantlytrial registration nederlands trial register registration number ntr2944
