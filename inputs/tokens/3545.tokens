purpose of review capsaicin and its nonpungent analog capsinoids are known to be food ingredients that increase energy expenditure and decrease body fatthis article reviews the role of brown adipose tissue bat for the thermogenic effect of these compounds in humans and proposes the possibility of some other antiobesity food ingredientsrecent findings a single oral ingestion of capsinoids increases energy expenditure in human individuals with metabolically active bat but not those without it indicating that capsinoids activate bat and thereby increase energy expenditurethis finding gave a rational explanation for discrepant results of the effects of capsinoids in the previous studieshuman bat may be largely composed of inducible beige adipocytes more than typical brown adipocytes because its gene expression patterns are similar to beige cells isolated from murine white fat depotsin fact preadipocytes isolated from supraclavicular fat deposits  where bat is often detected  are capable of differentiating into brownlike adipocytes in vitro providing evidence of inducible brown adipogenesis in adult humanssummary as human bat may be inducible a prolonged ingestion of capsinoids would recruit active bat and thereby increase energy expenditure and decrease body fatin addition to capsinoids there are numerous food ingredients that are expected to activate bat and so be useful for the prevention of obesity in daily life
