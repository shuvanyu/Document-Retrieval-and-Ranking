the existence of brown adipose tissue bat in humans has previously been assessed in vivo via sequential 18ffdg petct imagingwe developed a mri protocol to detect bat mass based on bats property of having higher watertofat ratio than white adipose tissue watwe showed that the signal contrast obtained between watersaturation and without watersaturation was higher in bat than in wat in fast spin echo images and in t2weighted imagesthe watertofat ratio was also higher in bat via contrasting the water and fat images of the dixon methodthe mri measured volume and location of bat was similar to petct results in the same subjectsin addition we also demonstrated that cold challenges 14 c led to significant fmri bold signal increases in bat
