background obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditurein rodents and newborn humans brown adipose tissue helps regulate energy expenditure by thermogenesis mediated by the expression of uncoupling protein 1 ucp1 but brown adipose tissue has been considered to have no physiologic relevance in adult humansmethods we analyzed 3640 consecutive 18ffluorodeoxyglucose 18ffdg positronemission tomographic and computed tomographic petct scans performed for various diagnostic reasons in 1972 patients for the presence of substantial depots of putative brown adipose tissuesuch depots were defined as collections of tissue that were more than 4 mm in diameter had the density of adipose tissue according to ct and had maximal standardized uptake values of 18ffdg of at least 20 g per milliliter indicating high metabolic activityclinical indexes were recorded and compared with those of datematched controlsimmunostaining for ucp1 was performed on biopsy specimens from the neck and supraclavicular regions in patients undergoing surgeryresults substantial depots of brown adipose tissue were identified by petct in a region extending from the anterior neck to the thoraxtissue from this region had ucp1immunopositive multilocular adipocytes indicating brown adipose tissuepositive scans were seen in 76 of 1013 women 75 and 30 of 959 men 31 corresponding to a femalemale ratio greater than 21 p0001women also had a greater mass of brown adipose tissue and higher 18ffdg uptake activitythe probability of the detection of brown adipose tissue was inversely correlated with years of age p0001 outdoor temperature at the time of the scan p 002 betablocker use p0001 and among older patients bodymass index p  0007conclusions defined regions of functionally active brown adipose tissue are present in adult humans are more frequent in women than in men and may be quantified noninvasively with the use of 18ffdg petctmost important the amount of brown adipose tissue is inversely correlated with bodymass index especially in older people suggesting a potential role of brown adipose tissue in adult human metabolism
