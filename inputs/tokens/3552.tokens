background capsinoidsnonpungent capsaicin analogsare known to activate brown adipose tissue bat thermogenesis and wholebody energy expenditure ee in small rodentsbat activity can be assessed by ¹⁸ffluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography fdgpet in humansobjectives the aims of the current study were to examine the acute effects of capsinoid ingestion on ee and to analyze its relation to bat activity in humansdesign eighteen healthy men aged 2032 y underwent fdgpet after 2 h of cold exposure 19c while wearing light clothingwholebody ee and skin temperature after oral ingestion of capsinoids 9 mg were measured for 2 h under warm conditions 27c in a singleblind randomized placebocontrolled crossover designresults when exposed to cold 10 subjects showed marked fdg uptake into adipose tissue of the supraclavicular and paraspinal regions batpositive group whereas the remaining 8 subjects batnegative group showed no detectable uptakeunder warm conditions 27c the mean sem resting ee was 6114  226 kjd in the batpositive group and 6307  156 kjd in the batnegative group nsee increased by 152  26 kjh in 1 h in the batpositive group and by 17  38 kjh in the batnegative group after oral ingestion of capsinoids p  001placebo ingestion produced no significant change in either groupneither capsinoids nor placebo changed the skin temperature in various regions including regions close to bat depositsconclusion capsinoid ingestion increases ee through the activation of bat in humansthis trial was registered at httpwwwuminacjpctr as umin 000006073
