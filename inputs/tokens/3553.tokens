increased 18ffdg activity in fatty tissue has previously been reported with petctwe previously named this activity uptake in supraclavicular area fat usafatwe and others have speculated that this uptake exists in metabolically active brown adipose tissue batsuch tissue might be expected to have varying metabolic activity depending on the ambient temperaturethe purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of usafat and its relationship to the outdoor temperaturemethods between july 2001 and june 2002 1017 consecutive wholebody scans were obtained with a petct scanner and 18ffdg for clinical patientspet images were reviewed for the presence of usafatresults usafat was observed in 68 scans obtained from 62 patients 51 female and 11 malethe incidence of usafat was highest at 137 in january through march while outside temperatures were low and was significantly lower at 41 during the rest of the yearconclusion the incidence of usafat is clearly increased during the cooler period of the yearthis finding suggests that stimulation by cold temperatures increases the frequency with which usafat occurs supporting underlying bat as the etiology for this activity
