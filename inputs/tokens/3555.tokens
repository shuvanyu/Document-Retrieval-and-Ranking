backgroundaims this study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes of bacteria bacteroides bifidobacterium and clostridium cluster iv in faecal microbiota associated with a vegetarian dietmethods bacterial abundances were measured in faecal samples of 15 vegetarians and 14 omnivores using quantitative pcrdiversity was assessed with pcrdgge fingerprinting principal component analysis pca and shannon diversity indexresults vegetarians had a 12 higher abundance of bacterial dna than omnivores a tendency for less clostridium cluster iv 3186  1700 3664  1422 and higher abundance of bacteroides 2393  1035 2126  805 which were not significant due to high interindividual variationspca suggested a grouping of bacteria and members of clostridium cluster ivtwo bands appeared significantly more frequently in omnivores than in vegetarians p  0005 and p  0022one was identified as faecalibacterium spand the other was 979 similar to the uncultured gut bacteriumdq793301conclusions a vegetarian diet affects the intestinal microbiota especially by decreasing the amount and changing the diversity of clostridium cluster ivit remains to be determined how these shifts might affect the host metabolism and disease riskscopyright 2009 s karger ag basel
