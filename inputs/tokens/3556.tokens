this study reviewed the literature on the relations between exposure to chemicals with endocrinedisrupting abilities and obesity in humansthe studies generally indicated that exposure to some of the endocrinedisrupting chemicals was associated with an increase in body size in humansthe results depended on the type of chemical exposure level timing of exposure and gendernearly all the studies investigating dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde found that exposure was associated with an increase in body size whereas the results of the studies investigating polychlorinated biphenyl pcb exposure were depending on dose timing and genderhexachlorobenzene polybrominated biphenyls betahexachlorocyclohexane oxychlordane and phthalates were likewise generally associated with an increase in body sizestudies investigating polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans found either associations with weight gain or an increase in waist circumference or no associationthe one study investigating relations with bisphenol a found no associationstudies investigating prenatal exposure indicated that exposure in utero may cause permanent physiological changes predisposing to later weight gainthe study findings suggest that some endocrine disruptors may play a role for the development of the obesity epidemic in addition to the more commonly perceived putative contributors 2011 the authorsobesity reviews  2011 international association for the study of obesity
