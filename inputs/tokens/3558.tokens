objective previous work studying vegetarians has often found that they have lower blood pressure bpreasons may include their lower bmi and higher intake levels of fruit and vegetableshere we seek to extend this evidence in a geographically diverse population containing vegans lactoovo vegetarians and omnivoresdesign data are analysed from a calibration substudy of the adventist health study2 ahs2 cohort who attended clinics and provided validated ffqcriteria were established for vegan lactoovo vegetarian partial vegetarian and omnivorous dietary patternssetting clinics were conducted at churches across the usa and canadadietary data were gathered by mailed questionnairesubjects five hundred white subjects representing the ahs2 cohortresults covariateadjusted regression analyses demonstrated that the vegan vegetarians had lower systolic and diastolic bp mmhg than omnivorous adventists β 68 p005 and β  69 p0001findings for lactoovo vegetarians β  91 p0001 and β  58 p0001 were similarthe vegetarians mainly the vegans were also less likely to be using antihypertensive medicationsdefining hypertension as systolic bp  139 mmhg or diastolic bp  89 mmhg or use of antihypertensive medications the odds ratio of hypertension compared with omnivores was 037 95  ci 019 074 057 95  ci 036 092 and 092 95  ci 050 170 respectively for vegans lactoovo vegetarians and partial vegetarianseffects were reduced after adjustment for bmiconclusions we conclude from this relatively large study that vegetarians especially vegans with otherwise diverse characteristics but stable diets do have lower systolic and diastolic bp and less hypertension than omnivoresthis is only partly due to their lower body mass
