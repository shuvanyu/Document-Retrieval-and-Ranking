until recently intact protein that is rich in tryptophan was not seen as an alternative to pharmaceuticalgrade tryptophan because protein also contains large neutral amino acids lnaas that compete for transport sites across the bloodbrain barrierrecent evidence indicates that when deoiled gourd seed a rich source of tryptophan with approximately 22 mgg protein is combined with glucose a carbohydrate that reduces serum levels of competing lnaas a clinical effect similar to that of pharmaceuticalgrade tryptophan is achievedobjective and subjective measures of anxiety in those suffering from social phobia also known as social anxiety disorder were employed to measure changes in anxiety in response to a stimulus as part of a doubleblind placebocontrolled crossover study with a washout period of 1 week between study sessionssubjects were randomly assigned to start with either i proteinsource tryptophan deoiled gourd seed in combination with carbohydrate or ii carbohydrate aloneone week after the initial session subjects returned for a followup session and received the opposite treatment of that received at the first sessionall 7 subjects who began the study completed the 2week protocolproteinsource tryptophan with carbohydrate but not carbohydrate alone resulted in significant improvement on an objective measure of anxietyproteinsource tryptophan combined with a high glycemic carbohydrate is a potential anxiolytic to those suffering from social phobia
