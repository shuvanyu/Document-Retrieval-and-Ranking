three recent casecontrol studies conclude that diets high in animal fat or cholesterol are associated with a substantial increase in risk for parkinsons disease pd in contrast fat of plant origin does not appear to increase riskwhereas reported ageadjusted prevalence rates of pd tend to be relatively uniform throughout europe and the americas subsaharan black africans rural chinese and japanese groups whose diets tend to be vegan or quasivegan appear to enjoy substantially lower ratessince current pd prevalence in africanamericans is little different from that in whites environmental factors are likely to be responsible for the low pd risk in black africansin aggregate these findings suggest that vegan diets may be notably protective with respect to pdhowever they offer no insight into whether saturated fat compounds associated with animal fat animal protein or the integrated impact of the components of animal products mediates the risk associated with animal fat consumptioncaloric restriction has recently been shown to protect the central dopaminergic neurons of mice from neurotoxins at least in part by induction of heatshock proteins conceivably the protection afforded by vegan diets reflects a similar mechanismthe possibility that vegan diets could be therapeutically beneficial in pd by slowing the loss of surviving dopaminergic neurons thus retarding progression of the syndrome may merit examinationvegan diets could also be helpful to pd patients by promoting vascular health and aiding bloodbrain barrier transport of ldopacopyright 2001 harcourt publishers ltd
