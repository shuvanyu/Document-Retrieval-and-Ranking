the present study investigated the effects of a diet and exercise intervention on known breast cancer bca risk factors including estrogen obesity insulin and insulinlike growth factori igfi in overweightobese postmenopausal womenin addition using the subjects pre and postintervention serum in vitro serumstimulated growth and apoptosis of three estrogen receptorpositive bca cell lines were studiedthe women where placed on a lowfat 1015 kcal highfiber 3040 g per 1000 kcalday diet and attended daily exercise classes for 2 wkserum estradiol was reduced in the women on hormone treatment ht n  28 as well as those not on ht n  10serum insulin and igfi were significantly reduced in all women whereas igf binding protein1 was increased significantlyin vitro growth of the bca cell lines was reduced by 66 for the mcf7 cells 99 for the zr751 cells and 185 for the t47d cellsapoptosis was increased by 20 in the zr751 cells 23 in the mcf7 cells and 30 in the t47d cells n  12these results show that a verylowfat highfiber diet combined with daily exercise results in major reductions in risk factors for bca while subjects remained overweightobesethese in vivo serum changes slowed the growth and induced apoptosis in serumstimulated bca cell lines in vitro
