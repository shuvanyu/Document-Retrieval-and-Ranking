rye whole grain and bran intake has shown beneficial effects on prostate cancer progression in animal models including lower tumor take rates smaller tumor volumes and reduced prostate specific antigen psa concentrationsa human pilot study showed increased apoptosis after consumption of rye bran breadin this study we investigated the effect of high intake of rye whole grain and bran on prostate cancer progression as assessed by psa concentration in men diagnosed with prostate cancerseventeen participants were provided with 485 g rye whole grain and bran products rp or refined wheat products with added cellulose wp corresponding to 50 of daily energy intake in a randomized controlled crossover designblood samples were taken from fasting men before and after 2 4 and 6 wk of treatment and 24h urine samples were collected before the first intervention period and after treatmentplasma total psa concentrations were lower after treatment with rp compared with wp with a mean treatment effect of 14 p  004additionally fasting plasma insulin and 24h urinary cpeptide excretion were lower after treatment with rp compared with wp p  001 and p  001 respectivelydaily excretion of 5 lignans was higher after the rp treatment than after the wp treatment p  0001we conclude that whole grain and bran from rye resulted in significantly lower plasma psa compared with a cellulosesupplemented refined wheat diet in patients with prostate cancerthe effect may be related to inhibition of prostate cancer progression caused by decreased exposure to insulin as indicated by plasma insulin and urinary cpeptide excretion
