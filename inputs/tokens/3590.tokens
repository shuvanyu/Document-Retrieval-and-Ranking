alkylresorcinols ars are shown to be good biomarkers of consumption of rye and wholegrain wheat products in manthe aim of this pilot study was to investigate ar metabolites as potential biomarkers of breast cancer bc risk in finnish women since intake of cereal fiber and its components has been proposed to reduce this risk through an effect on the enterohepatic circulation of estrogensthis was a crosssectional and observational pilot studya total of 20 omnivores 20 vegetarians and 16 bc women 612 mo after operation were investigated on 2 occasions 6 mo apartdietary intake 5days record plasmaurinary ar metabolites 35dihydroxybenzoic acid dhba and 335dihydroxyphenyl1propanoic acid dhppa and plasmaurinary enterolactone were measuredthe groups were compared using nonparametric testswe observed that plasma dhba p  0007 p  003 plasma dhppa p  002 p  001 urinary dhba p  0001 p  0003 urinary dhppa p  0001 p  0001 and cereal fiber intake p  0007 p  0003 were significantly lower in the bc group compared to the vegetarian and omnivore groups respectivelybased on measurements of ar metabolites in urine and in plasma wholegrain rye and wheat cereal fiber intake is low in bc subjectsthus urinary and plasma ar metabolites may be used as potential biomarkers of bc risk in womenthis novel approach will likely also facilitate studies of associations between rye and wholegrain wheat cereal fiber intake and other diseasesour findings should however be confirmed with larger subject populations
