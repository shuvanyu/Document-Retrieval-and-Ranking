background studies of single nutrients on depression have produced inconsistent results and they have failed to consider the complex interactions between nutrientsan increasing number of studies in recent years are investigating the association of overall dietary patterns and depressionobjective this study aimed to systematically review current literature and conduct metaanalyses of studies addressing the association between dietary patterns and depressiondesign six electronic databases were searched for articles published up to august 2013 that examined the association of total diet and depression among adultsonly studies considered methodologically rigorous were includedtwo independent reviewers completed study selection quality rating and data extractioneffect sizes of eligible studies were pooled by using randomeffects modelsa summary of the findings was presented for studies that could not be metaanalyzedresults a total of 21 studies were identifiedresults from 13 observational studies were pooledtwo dietary patterns were identifiedthe healthy diet pattern was significantly associated with a reduced odds of depression or 084 95 ci 076 092 p  0001no statistically significant association was observed between the western diet and depression or 117 95 ci 097 168 p  0094 however the studies were too few for a precise estimate of this effectconclusions the results suggest that high intakes of fruit vegetables fish and whole grains may be associated with a reduced depression riskhowever more highquality randomized controlled trials and cohort studies are needed to confirm this finding specifically the temporal sequence of this association
