objective eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha have been implicated as protective against suicidehowever it is uncertain whether a higher intake of epa and dha or of fish a major source of these nutrients lowers suicidal risk among japanese whose fish consumption and suicide rate are both highthis study prospectively examined the relation between fish epa or dha intake and suicide among japanese men and womenmethod subjects were 47351 men and 54156 women aged 4069 years who participated in the jphc study completed a food frequency questionnaire in 19951999 and were followed for death through december 2005we used the cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio hr and 95 confidence interval ci for suicide by quintile of intakeresults a total of 213 and 85 deaths from suicide were recorded during 403019 and 473351 personyears of followup for men and women respectivelyhigher intakes of fish epa or dha were not associated with a lower risk of suicidemultivariate hrs 95 ci of suicide death for the highest versus lowest quintile of fish consumption were 095 060149 and 120 058247 for men and women respectivelya significantly increased risk of suicidal death was observed among women with very low intake of fish with hrs 95 ci for those in 05th percentile versus middle quintile of 341 136851conclusions our overall result does not support a protective role of higher intake of fish epa or dha against suicide in japanese men and womencopyright  2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
