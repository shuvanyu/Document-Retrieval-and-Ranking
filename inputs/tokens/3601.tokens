background there are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwideas a response to increasing concern about suicide within europe the eurosave european review of suicide and violence epidemiology study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and selfinflicted injury mortality in the european union eumethods suicide and selfinflicted injury mortality data for the 15 eu countries for the years 19841998 were obtained from the world health organisation who the european statistical office of the european commission eurostat and national statistical agenciesdata were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as undetermined or other violenceagestandardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over timeresults finland had the highest suicide rate while greece had the lowest for the latest available year 1997agestandardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the mediterranean countriessignificant downward linear time trends in suicide mortality were observed in most countries although rates varied markedly between countriesboth ireland and spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortalityportugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths both in 1984 and 1998 while greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997five countries including ireland and spain showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas belgium and germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causesconclusions although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing the validity of the data is uncertainmisclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some eu countries but it does not explain the phenomenonmore detailed research comparing suiciderecording procedures and practices across the eu is requiredin the absence of adequate eu wide data on suicide epidemiology effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive
