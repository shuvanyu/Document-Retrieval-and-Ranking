we conducted a metaanalysis of randomized placebocontrolled trials of omega3 fatty acid treatment of major depressive disorder in order to determine efficacy and to examine sources of heterogeneity between trialspubmed 1965may 2010 was searched for randomized placebocontrolled trials of omega3 fatty acids for major depressive disorderour primary outcome measure was standardized mean difference in a clinical measure of depression severityin stratified metaanalysis we examined the effects of trial duration trial methodological quality baseline depression severity diagnostic indication dose of eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha in omega3 preparations and whether omega3 fatty acid was given as monotherapy or augmentationin 13 randomized placebocontrolled trials examining the efficacy of omega3 fatty acids involving 731 participants metaanalysis demonstrated no significant benefit of omega3 fatty acid treatment compared to placebo smd011 95 ci 004 026metaanalysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity and publication biasnearly all evidence of omega3 benefit was removed after adjusting for publication bias using the trimandfill method smd001 95 ci 013 015secondary analyses suggested a trend towards increased efficacy of omega3 fatty acids in trials of lower methodological quality trials of shorter duration trials which utilized completers rather than intentiontotreat analysis and trials in which study participants had greater baseline depression severity current published trials suggest a small nonsignificant benefit of omega3 fatty acids for major depressionnearly all of the treatment efficacy observed in the published literature may be attributable to publication bias
