background the evidence for meat intake and renal cell carcinoma rcc risk is inconsistentmutagens related to meat cooking and processing and variation by rcc subtype may be important to considerobjective in a large us cohort we prospectively investigated intake of meat and meatrelated compounds in relation to risk of rcc as well as clear cell and papillary rcc histologic subtypesdesign study participants 492186 completed a detailed dietary assessment linked to a database of heme iron heterocyclic amines hca polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs nitrate and nitrite concentrations in cooked and processed meatsover 9 mean y of followup we identified 1814 cases of rcc 498 clear cell and 115 papillary adenocarcinomashrs and 95 cis were estimated within quintiles by using multivariable cox proportional hazards regressionresults red meat intake 627 g quintile 5 compared with 98 g quintile 1 per 1000 kcal median was associated with a tendency toward an increased risk of rcc hr 119 95 ci 101 140 ptrend  006 and a 2fold increased risk of papillary rcc ptrend  0002intakes of benzoapyrene bap a marker of pahs and 2amino1methyl6phenylimidazo45bpyridine phip an hca were associated with a significant 2030 elevated risk of rcc and a 2fold increased risk of papillary rccno associations were observed for the clear cell subtypeconclusions red meat intake may increase the risk of rcc through mechanisms related to the cooking compounds bap and phipour findings for rcc appeared to be driven by strong associations with the rarer papillary histologic variantthis study is registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct00340015
