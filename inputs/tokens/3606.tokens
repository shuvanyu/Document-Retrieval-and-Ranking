background tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand trail is a promising anticancer agent which selectively kills cancer cells with little effect on normal cellshowever trail resistance is widely found in cancer cellswe have previously reported antimetatstatic and antiangiogenic effects of vanillin a flavoring agent from vanillahere we have evaluated the sensitizing effect of vanillin on a trailresistant human cervical cancer cell line helamaterials and methods cell viability after treatments was determined by the wst1 cell counting kitapoptosis was demonstrated by detection of caspase3 activation and cleavage of poly adpribose polymerase using immunoblot analysiseffect of treatments on trail signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappab fnkappab activation was studied using immunoblot analysis and luciferase reporter assayresults pretreatment of hela cells with vanillin enhanced trailinduced cell death through the apoptosis pathwayvanillin pretreatment inhibited trailinduced phosphorylation of p65 and transcriptional activity of nfkappabconclusion vanillin sensitizes hela cells to trailinduced apoptosis by inhibiting nfkappab activation
