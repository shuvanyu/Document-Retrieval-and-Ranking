aims the purpose of this study was to search for a novel quorum sensing inhibitor and analyse its inhibitory activitymethods and results quorum sensing inhibition was monitored using the tn5 mutant chromobacterium violaceum cv026vanilla beans vanilla planifolia andrews were extracted using 75 vv aqueous methanol and added to c violaceum cv026 culturesinhibitory activity was measured by quantifying violacein production using a spectrophotometerthe results have revealed that vanilla extract significantly reduced violacein production in a concentrationdependent manner indicating inhibition of quorum sensingconclusions vanilla a widely used spice and flavour can inhibit bacterial quorum sensingsignificance and impact of the study the results suggest that the intake of vanillacontaining food materials might promote human health by inhibiting quorum sensing and preventing bacterial pathogenesisfurther studies are required to isolate specific substances from vanilla extract acting as quorum sensing inhibitors
