background evidence links dietary sodium to hypertension and cardiovascular disease cvd but investigation of its influence on cardiovascular function is limitedobjective we examined the relation between habitual dietary sodium and coronary flow reserve cfr which is a measure of overall coronary vasodilator capacity and microvascular functionwe hypothesized that increased sodium consumption is associated with lower cfrdesign habitual daily sodium intake for the previous 12 mo was measured in 286 male middleaged twins 133 monozygotic and dizygotic pairs and 20 unpaired twins by using the willett foodfrequency questionnairecfr was measured by positron emission tomography n13ammonia with quantitation of myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stressmixedeffects regression analysis was used to assess the association between dietary sodium and cfrresults an increase in dietary sodium of 1000 mgd was associated with a 100 lower cfr 95 ci 170 25 after adjustment for demographic lifestyle nutritional and cvd risk factors p  001across quintiles of sodium consumption dietary sodium was inversely associated with cfr ptrend  003 with the top quintile 1456 mgd having a 20 lower cfr than the bottom quintile 732 mg dthis association also persisted within pairs a 1000mgd difference in dietary sodium between brothers was associated with a 103 difference in cfr after adjustment for potential confounders p  002conclusions habitual dietary sodium is inversely associated with cfr independent of cvd risk factors and shared familial and genetic factorsour study suggests a potential novel mechanism for the adverse effects of dietary sodium on the cardiovascular systemthis trial was registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct00017836
