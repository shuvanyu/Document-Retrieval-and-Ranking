scottishgrown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin c and phenolics most notably the anthocyanins cyanidin3sophoroside cyanidin32gglucosylrutinoside and cyanidin3glucoside and two ellagitannins sanguiin h6 and lambertianin c which are present together with trace levels of flavonols ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamatesthe antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin c and phenolics were not affected by freezingwhen fruit were stored at 4 degrees c for 3 days and then at 18 degrees c for 24 h mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to the supermarket and onto the consumers table anthocyanin levels were unaffected while vitamin c levels declined and those of elligitannins increased and overall there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruitit is concluded therefore that freshly picked fresh commercial and frozen raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per serving
