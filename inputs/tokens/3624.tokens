background current unitage for the calciferols suggests that equimolar quantities of vitamins d2 d2 and d3 d3 are biologically equivalentpublished studies yield mixed resultsobjective the aim of the study was to compare the potencies of d2 and d3design the trial used a singleblind randomized design in 33 healthy adultscalciferols were dosed at 50000 iuwk for 12 wkprincipal outcome variables were area under the curve for incremental total 25hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd and change in calciferol content of sc fatresults incremental mean sd 25ohd area under the curve at 12 wk was 1366 ng  dml 516 for the d2treated group and 2136 606 for the d3 p  0001mean sd steadystate 25ohd increments showed similar differences 24 ngml for d2 103 and 45 ngml 162 for d3 p 0001subcutaneous fat content of d2 rose by 50 μgkg in the d2treated group and d3 content rose by 104 μgkg in the d3treated grouptotal calciferol in fat rose by only 33 ngkg in the d2treated whereas it rose by 104 μgkg in the d3treated groupextrapolating to total body fat d3 storage amounted to just 17 of the administered doseconclusion d3 is approximately 87 more potent in raising and maintaining serum 25ohd concentrations and produces 2 to 3fold greater storage of vitamin d than does equimolar d2for neither was there evidence of sequestration in fat as had been postulated for doses in this rangegiven its greater potency and lower cost d3 should be the preferred treatment option when correcting vitamin d deficiency
