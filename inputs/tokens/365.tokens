background clostridium difficile colitis cdc is a major health concern in the united states us with earlier reports demonstrating a rising incidencestudies analyzing predictors for total colectomy and mortality after colectomy are limited by small numbersstudy design the nationwide inpatient sample nis 2001 to 2010 was retrospectively reviewed for cdc trends the associated colectomy and mortality ratespatient and hospital variables were used in the lasso algorithm for logistic regression with 10fold cross validation to build a predictive model for colectomy requirement and mortality after colectomythe association of colectomy day with mortality was also examined on multivariable logistic regression analysisresults an estimated 2773521 discharges with a diagnosis of cdc were identified in the us over a decadecolectomy was required in 19374 cases 07 with an associated mortality of 307compared with the 2001 to 2005 period the 2006 to 2010 period witnessed a 47 increase in the rate of cdc and a 32 increase in the rate of colectomiesthe lasso algorithm identified the following predictors for colectomy coagulopathy odds ratio or 271 weight loss or 225 teaching hospitals or 137 fluid or electrolyte disorders or 131 and large hospitals or 118the predictors of mortality after colectomy were coagulopathy or 238 age greater than 60 years or 197 acute renal failure or 167 respiratory failure or 161 sepsis or 140 peripheral vascular disease or 139 and congestive heart failure or 125surgery more than 3 days after admission was associated with higher mortality rates or 109 95 ci 105 to 114 p  005conclusions clostridium difficile colitis is increasing in the us with an associated increase in total colectomiesmortality rates after colectomy remain elevatedprogression to colectomy and mortality thereafter are associated with several patient and hospital factorsknowledge of these risk factors may help in riskstratification and counselingcopyright  2013 american college of surgeonspublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
