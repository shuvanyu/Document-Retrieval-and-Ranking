background it has been thought that clostridium difficile infection is transmitted predominantly within health care settingshowever endemic spread has hampered identification of precise sources of infection and the assessment of the efficacy of interventionsmethods from september 2007 through march 2011 we performed wholegenome sequencing on isolates obtained from all symptomatic patients with c difficile infection identified in health care settings or in the community in oxfordshire united kingdomwe compared singlenucleotide variants snvs between the isolates using c difficile evolution rates estimated on the basis of the first and last samples obtained from each of 145 patients with 0 to 2 snvs expected between transmitted isolates obtained less than 124 days apart on the basis of a 95 prediction intervalwe then identified plausible epidemiologic links among genetically related cases from data on hospital admissions and community locationresults of 1250 c difficile cases that were evaluated 1223 98 were successfully sequencedin a comparison of 957 samples obtained from april 2008 through march 2011 with those obtained from september 2007 onward a total of 333 isolates 35 had no more than 2 snvs from at least 1 earlier case and 428 isolates 45 had more than 10 snvs from all previous casesreductions in incidence over time were similar in the two groups a finding that suggests an effect of interventions targeting the transition from exposure to diseaseof the 333 patients with no more than 2 snvs consistent with transmission 126 patients 38 had close hospital contact with another patient and 120 patients 36 had no hospital or community contact with another patientdistinct subtypes of infection continued to be identified throughout the study which suggests a considerable reservoir of c difficileconclusions over a 3year period 45 of c difficile cases in oxfordshire were genetically distinct from all previous casesgenetically diverse sources in addition to symptomatic patients play a major part in c difficile transmissionfunded by the uk clinical research collaboration translational infection research initiative and others
