clostridium difficile causes infectious diarrhoea in humans and animalsit has been found in both diarrhoeal and nondiarrhoeal pigs horses and cattle suggesting a potential reservoir for human insection and in 2040  of meat products in canada and the usa suggesting the possibility albeit not proven of foodborne transmissionalthough it is not yet completely clear it is likely that excessive antimicrobial exposure is driving the establishment of c difficile in animals in a manner analogous to human infection rather than the organism just being normal flora of the animal gastrointestinal tractpcr ribotype 078 is the most common ribotype of c difficile found in pigs 83  in one study in the usa and cattle up to 100  and this ribotype is now the third most common ribotype of c difficile found in human infection in europehuman and pig strains of c difficile are genetically identical in europe confirming that a zoonosis existsrates of communityacquired c difficile infection cdi are increasing world wide a fact that sits well with the notion that animals are a reservoir for human infectionthus there are three problems that require resolution a human health issue an animal health issue and the factor common to both these problems environmental contaminationto successfully deal with these recent changes in the epidemiology of cdi will require a one health approach involving human health physicians veterinarians and environmental scientists
