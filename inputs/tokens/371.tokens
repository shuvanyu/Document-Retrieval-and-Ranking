many articles have summarized the changing epidemiology of clostridium difficile infections cdi in humans but the emerging presence of c difficile in foods and animals and possible measures to reduce human exposure to this important pathogen have been infrequently addressedcdis have traditionally been assumed to be restricted to healthcare settingshowever recent molecular studies indicate that this is no longer the case animals and foods might be involved in the changing epidemiology of cdis in humans and genome sequencing is disproving persontoperson transmission in hospitalsalthough zoonotic and foodborne transmission have not been confirmed it is evident that susceptible people can be inadvertently exposed to c difficile from foods animals or their environmentstrains of epidemic clones present in humans are common in companion and food animals raw meats poultry products vegetables and readytoeat foods including saladsin order to develop sciencebased prevention strategies it is critical to understand how c difficile reaches foods and humansthis review contextualizes the current understanding of cdis in humans animals and foodsbased on available information we propose a list of educational measures that could reduce the exposure of susceptible people to c difficileenhanced educational efforts and behavior change targeting medical and nonmedical personnel are needed
