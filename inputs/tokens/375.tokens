to correct methodologic flaws type ii error confounding variables and nonblinding in previous studies relating infant feeding to later obesity we conducted casecontrol studies of 639 patients 12 to 18 years of age attending our adolescent clinic and 533 similarly aged healthy children attending a montreal high schooleach subject was classified as either obese overweight or nonobese based on measurements of height weight and triceps and subscapular skinfoldsfeeding history family history and demographic data were later ascertained blindly by telephone interviewanalysis of the raw data revealed a significantly elevated estimated relative risk of not breastfeeding and a significant trend for rates of breastfeeding among the three weight groupsthe magnitude of the protective effect appeared to rise slightly with increased duration of breastfeedingdelayed introduction of solid foods provided little if any additional benefitseveral demographic and clinical variables proved to be confounding but the significant protective effect of breastfeeding persisted even after controlling for confounderswe conclude that breastfeeding does protect against later obesity and attribute the conflicting results of previous studies to insufficient attention to methodologic standards
