background fiber intake is associated with lower cardiovascular disease riskwhether arterial stiffness is influenced by lifetime fiber intake is not knownany such association could explain at least in part the cardioprotective effects attributed to fiber intakeobjective the objective was to investigate whether a lower intake of fiber and fiberrich foods throughout the course of young life ie from adolescence to adulthood is associated with arterial stiffness in adulthooddesign this was a longitudinal cohort study among 373 participants in whom dietary intake was assessed between the ages of 13 to 36 y 28 repeated measures median of 5 and arterial stiffness estimates of 3 large arteries ultrasonography were ascertained at age 36 yresults after adjustment for sex height total energy intake and other lifestyle variables subjects with stiffer carotid arteries consumed less fiber in gd during the 24y study than did those with less stiff carotid arteries as defined on the basis of the highest compared with the lowest sexspecific tertiles of the distensibility and compliance coefficients reversed and youngs elastic modulus 19 95 ci 31 07 23 35 11 and 13 25 00 respectivelyfurthermore subjects with stiffer carotid arteries were characterized by a lower lifetime consumption of fruit vegetables and whole grainsdeleterious associations that could be explained to a great extent by related low fiber intakeconclusions lower lifetime intake of fiber during the course of young age is associated with carotid artery stiffness in adulthoodpromoting consumption of fiberrich foods among the young may offer a means to prevent accelerated arterial stiffening in adulthood and related cardiovascular sequelae
