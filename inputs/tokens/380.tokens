background and purpose fiber intake is associated with reduced stroke risk in prospective studies but no metaanalysis has been published to datemethods multiple electronic databases were searched for healthy participant studies reporting fiber intake and incidence of first hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke published between january 1990 and may 2012results eight cohort studies from the united states northern europe australia and japan met inclusion criteriatotal dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with risk of hemorrhagic plus ischemic stroke with some evidence of heterogeneity between studies i2 relative risk per 7 gday 093 95 confidence interval 088098 i259soluble fiber intake per 4 gday was not associated with stroke risk reduction with evidence of low heterogeneity between studies relative risk 094 95 confidence interval 088101 i221there were few studies reporting stroke risk in relation to insoluble fiber or fiber from cereals fruit or vegetablesconclusions greater dietary fiber intake is significantly associated with lower risk of first strokeoverall findings support dietary recommendations to increase intake of total dietary fiberhowever a paucity of data on fiber from different foods precludes conclusions regarding the association between fiber type and strokethere is a need for future studies to focus on fiber type and to examine risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately
