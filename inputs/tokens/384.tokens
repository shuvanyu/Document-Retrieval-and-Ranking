the relationship between dietary fat and glucose metabolism has been recognized for at least 60 yearsin experimental animals high fat diets result in impaired glucose tolerancethis impairment is associated with decreased basal and insulinstimulated glucose metabolismimpaired insulin binding andor glucose transporters has been related to changes in the fatty acid composition of the membrane induced by dietary fat modificationin humans highfat diets independent of fatty acid profile have been reported to result in decreased insulin sensitivitysaturated fat relative to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat appears to be more deleterious with respect to fatinduced insulin insensitivitysome of the adverse effects induced by fat feeding can be ameliorated with omega3 fatty acidepidemiological data in humans suggest that subjects with higher intakes of fat are more prone to develop disturbances in glucose metabolism type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance than subjects with lower intakes of fatinconsistencies in the data may be attributable to clustering of high intakes of dietary fat especially animal fat with obesity and inactivitymetabolic studies suggest that higherfat diets containing a higher proportion of unsaturated fat result in better measures of glucose metabolism than highcarbohydrate dietclearly the area of dietary fat and glucose metabolism has yet to be fully elucidated
