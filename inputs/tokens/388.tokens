frequently patients identified as high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv are treated prophylactically with intravenous iv ondansetron and postoperatively with iv promethazinethe purpose of this study was to determine if using an aromatic therapy of 70 isopropyl alcohol ipa would be more effective than promethazine in resolution of breakthrough ponv symptoms in groups of highrisk patients administered prophylactic ondansetronall subjects enrolled were identified as high risk for ponv administered general anesthesia and a prophylactic antiemetic of 4 mg of iv ondansetron and randomized to receive ipa or promethazine for treatment of breakthrough ponv demographics verbal numeric rating scale vnrs scores for nausea time to 50 reduction in vnrs scores and overall antiemetic and incidence of ponv were measuredthe data for 85 subjects were included in analysis no differences in demographic variables or baseline measurements were noted between groupsthe ipa group reported a faster time to 50 reduction in vnrs scores and decreased overall antiemetic requirementsa similar incidence in ponv was noted between groupsbased on these findings we recommend that inhalation of 70 ipa is an option for treatment of ponv in highrisk patients who have received prophylactic ondansetron
