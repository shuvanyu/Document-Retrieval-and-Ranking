epilepsy or seizure disorder is one of the most common neurological diseases in humansalthough genetic mutations in ion channels and receptors and some other risk factors such as brain injury are linked to epileptogenesis the underlying cause for the majority of epilepsy cases remains unknowngeneenvironment interactions are thought to play a critical role in the etiology of epilepsyexposure to environmental chemicals is an important risk factormethylmercury mehg is a prominent environmental neurotoxicant which targets primarily the central nervous system cnspatients or animals with acute or chronic mehg poisoning often display epileptic seizures or show increased susceptibility to seizures suggesting that mehg exposure may be associated with epileptogenesisthis minireview highlights the effects of mehg exposure especially developmental exposure on the susceptibility of humans and animals to seizures and discusses the potential role of low level mehg exposure in epileptogenesisthis review also proposes that a preferential effect of mehg on the inhibitory gabaergic system leading to disinhibition of excitatory glutamatergic function may be one of the potential mechanisms underlying mehginduced changes in seizure susceptibility
