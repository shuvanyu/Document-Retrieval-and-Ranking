we sought to determine whether consumption of blueberries could reduce postprandial oxidation when consumed with a typical highcarbohydrate lowfat breakfastparticipants n 14 received each of the three treatments over 3 weeks in a crossover designtreatments consisted of a high blueberry dose 75 g a low blueberry dose 35 g and a control ascorbic acid and sugar content matching that of the high blueberry doseserum oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac serum lipoprotein oxidation lo and serum ascorbate urate and glucose were measured at fasting and at 1 2 and 3 h after sample consumptionthe mean serum orac was significantly higher in the 75 g group than in the control group during the first 2 h postprandially while serum lo lag time showed a significant trend over the 3 h for both blueberry doseschanges in serum ascorbate urate and glucose were not significantly different among the groupsto our knowledge this is the first report that has demonstrated that increased serum antioxidant capacity is not attributable to the fructose or ascorbate content of blueberriesin summary a practically consumable quantity of blueberries 75 g can provide statistically significant oxidative protection in vivo after a highcarbohydrate lowfat breakfastthough not tested directly it is likely that the effects are due to phenolic compounds either directly or indirectly as they are a major family of compounds in blueberries with potential bioactive activity
