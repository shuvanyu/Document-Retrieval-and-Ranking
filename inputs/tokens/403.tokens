contrary to concerns that fructose may have adverse metabolic effects there is evidence that small catalytic doses   10 gmeal of fructose decrease the glycaemic response to highglycaemic index meals in human subjectsto assess the longerterm effects of catalytic doses of fructose we undertook a metaanalysis of controlled feeding trialswe searched medline embase cinahl and the cochrane libraryanalyses included all controlled feeding trials  7 d featuring catalytic fructose doses   36 gd in isoenergetic exchange for other carbohydratesdata were pooled by the generic inverse variance method using randomeffects models and expressed as mean differences md with 95  ciheterogeneity was assessed by the q statistic and quantified by i2the heyland methodological quality score assessed study qualitya total of six feeding trials n 118 met the eligibility criteriacatalytic doses of fructose significantly reduced hba1c md  040 95  ci  072  008 and fasting glucose md  025 95  ci  044  007this benefit was seen in the absence of adverse effects on fasting insulin body weight tag or uric acidsubgroup and sensitivity analyses showed evidence of effect modification under certain conditionsthe small number of trials and their relatively short duration limit the strength of the conclusionsin conclusion this small metaanalysis shows that catalytic fructose doses   36 gd may improve glycaemic control without adverse effects on body weight tag insulin and uric acidthere is a need for larger longer   6 months trials using catalytic fructose to confirm these results
