there is mounting evidence to suggest that environmental factors play a major role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like als amyotrophic lateral sclerosisthe nonprotein amino acid betanmethylaminolalanine bmaa was first associated with the high incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosisparkinsonism dementia complex alspdc in guam and has been implicated as a potential environmental factor in als alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative diseasesbmaa has a number of toxic effects on motor neurons including direct agonist action on nmda and ampa receptors induction of oxidative stress and depletion of glutathioneas a nonprotein amino acid there is also the strong possibility that bmaa could cause intraneuronal protein misfolding the hallmark of neurodegenerationwhile an animal model for bmaainduced als is lacking there is substantial evidence to support a link between this toxin and alsthe ramifications of discovering an environmental trigger for als are enormousin this article we discuss the history ecology pharmacology and clinical ramifications of this ubiquitous cyanobacteriaderived toxin
