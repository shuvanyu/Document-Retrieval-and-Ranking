Î²methylaminolalanine bmaa a neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid produced by most cyanobacteria has been proposed to be the causative agent of devastating neurodegenerative diseases on the island of guam in the pacific oceanbecause cyanobacteria are widespread globally we hypothesized that bmaa might occur and bioaccumulate in other ecosystemshere we demonstrate based on a recently developed extraction and hplcmsms method and longterm monitoring of bmaa in cyanobacterial populations of a temperate aquatic ecosystem baltic sea 20072008 that bmaa is biosynthesized by cyanobacterial genera dominating the massive surface blooms of this water bodybmaa also was found at higher concentrations in organisms of higher trophic levels that directly or indirectly feed on cyanobacteria such as zooplankton and various vertebrates fish and invertebrates mussels oysterspelagic and benthic fish species used for human consumption were includedthe highest bmaa levels were detected in the muscle and brain of bottomdwelling fishesthe discovery of regular biosynthesis of the neurotoxin bmaa in a large temperate aquatic ecosystem combined with its possible transfer and bioaccumulation within major food webs some ending in human consumption is alarming and requires attention
