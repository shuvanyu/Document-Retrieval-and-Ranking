previous evidence for spatial clustering of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is inconclusivestudies that have identified apparent clusters have often been based on a small number of cases which means the results may have occurred by chance processesalso most studies have used the geographic location at the time of death as the basis for cluster detection rather than exploring clusters at other points in the life cyclein this study the authors examine 1000 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis distributed throughout finland who died between june 1985 and december 1995using a spatialscan statistic the authors examine whether there are significant clusters of the disease at both time of birth and time of deathtwo significant neighboring clusters were identified in southeast and southcentral finland at the time of deatha single significant cluster was identified in southeast finland at the time of birth closely matching one of the clusters identified at the time of deaththese results are based on a large sample of cases and they provide convincing evidence of spatial clustering of this conditionthe results demonstrate also that if the cluster analysis is conducted at different stages of the cases life cycle different conclusions about where potential risk factors may exist might result
