there is a broad scientific consensus that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als is caused by geneenvironment interactionsmutations in genes underlying familial als fals have been discovered in only 510 of the total population of als patientsrelatively little attention has been paid to environmental and lifestyle factors that may trigger the cascade of motor neuron death leading to the syndrome of als although exposure to chemicals including lead and pesticides and to agricultural environments smoking certain sports and trauma have all been identified with an increased risk of alsthere is a need for research to quantify the relative roles of each of the identified risk factors for alsrecent evidence has strengthened the theory that chronic environmental exposure to the neurotoxic amino acid Î²nmethylaminolalanine bmaa produced by cyanobacteria may be an environmental risk factor for alshere we describe methods that may be used to assess exposure to cyanobacteria and hence potentially to bmaa namely an epidemiologic questionnaire and direct and indirect methods for estimating the cyanobacterial load in ecosystemsrigorous epidemiologic studies could determine the risks associated with exposure to cyanobacteria and if combined with genetic analysis of als cases and controls could reveal etiologically important geneenvironment interactions in genetically vulnerable individuals
