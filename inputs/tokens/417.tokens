cyanobacteria can generate molecules hazardous to human health but production of the known cyanotoxins is taxonomically sporadicfor example members of a few genera produce hepatotoxic microcystins whereas production of hepatotoxic nodularins appears to be limited to a single genusproduction of known neurotoxins has also been considered phylogenetically unpredictablewe report here that a single neurotoxin Î²nmethylaminolalanine may be produced by all known groups of cyanobacteria including cyanobacterial symbionts and freeliving cyanobacteriathe ubiquity of cyanobacteria in terrestrial as well as freshwater brackish and marine environments suggests a potential for widespread human exposure
