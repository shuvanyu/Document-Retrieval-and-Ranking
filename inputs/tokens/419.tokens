excitement about neurogenetics in the last two decades has diverted attention from environmental causes of sporadic alsfifty years ago endemic foci of als with a frequency one hundred times that in the rest of the world attracted attention since they offered the possibility of finding the cause for nonendemic als throughout the worldresearch on guam suggested that als parkinsons disease and dementia the alspdc complex was due to a neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid betamethylaminolalanine bmaa in the seeds of the cycad cycas micronesicarecent discoveries that found that bmaa is produced by symbiotic cyanobacteria within specialized roots of the cycads that the concentration of proteinbound bmaa is up to a hundredfold greater than free bmaa in the seeds and flour that various animals forage on the seeds flying foxes pigs deer leading to biomagnification up the food chain in guam and that proteinbound bmaa occurs in the brains of guamanians dying of alspdc average concentration 627 microgg 5 mm but not in control brains have rekindled interest in bmaa as a possible trigger for guamanian alspdcperhaps most intriguing is the finding that bmaa is present in brain tissues of north american patients who had died of alzheimers disease average concentration 95 microgg 08mm this suggests a possible etiological role for bmaa in nonguamanian neurodegenerative diseasescyanobacteria are ubiquitous throughout the world so it is possible that all humans are exposed to low amounts of cyanobacterial bmaa that proteinbound bmaa in human brains is a reservoir for chronic neurotoxicity and that cyanobacterial bmaa is a major cause of progressive neurodegenerative diseases including als worldwidethough montine et al using different hplc method and assay techniques from those used by cox and colleagues were unable to reproduce the findings of murch et al mash and colleagues using the original techniques of murch et alhave recently confirmed the presence of proteinbound bmaa in the brains of north american patients dying with als and alzheimers disease concentrations 100 microgg but not in the brains of nonneurological controls or huntingtons diseasewe hypothesize that individuals who develop neurodegenerations may have a genetic susceptibility because of inability to prevent bmaa accumulation in brain proteins and that the particular pattern of neurodegeneration that develops depends on the polygenic background of the individual
