we conducted an investigation of the levels of the neurotoxin 2amino3methylaminopropanoic acid bmaa in cycad flouranalysis of 30 flour samples processed from the endosperm of cycas circinalis seeds collected on guam indicated that more than 87 of the total bmaa content was removed during processingfurthermore in 12 the samples almost all greater than 99 of the total bmaa was removedwe found no significant regional differences in the bmaa content of flour prepared from cycad seeds collected from several villages on guamtesting of different samples prepared by the same chamorro woman over 2 years suggests that the washing procedure probably varies in thoroughness from preparation to preparation but is routinely efficient in removing at least 85 of the total bmaa from all batchesanalysis of a flour sample that had undergone only 24 hours of soaking indicated that this single wash removed 90 of the total bmaawe conclude that processed cycad flour as prepared by the chamorros of guam and rota contains extremely low levels of bmaa which are in the order of only 0005 by weight mean values for all samplesthus even when cycad flour is a dietary staple and eaten regularly it seems unlikely that these low levels could cause the delayed and widespread neurofibrillary degeneration of nerve cells observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the parkinsonismdementia complex of guam alspd
