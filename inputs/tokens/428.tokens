there has been enormous interest in the biologic activity of mushrooms and innumerable claims have been made that mushrooms have beneficial effects on immune function with subsequent implications for inhibition of tumor growththe majority of these observations are anecdotal and often lack standardizationhowever there remains considerable data on both in vitro and in vivo effects that reflect on the potential of mushroom compounds to influence human immunitya number of these effects are beneficial but unfortunately many responses are still characterized based on phenomenology and there is more speculation than substancewith respect to tumor biology although many neoplastic lesions are immunogenic tumor antigens frequently are self antigens and induce tolerance and many patients with cancer exhibit suppressed immune responses including defective antigen presentationtherefore if and when mushroom extracts are effective they more likely function as a result of improved antigen presentation by dendritic cells than by a direct cytopathic effectin this review we attempt to place these data in perspective with a particular focus on dendritic cell populations and the ability of mushroom extracts to modulate immunitythere is at present no scientific basis for the use of either mushrooms or mushroom extracts in the treatment of human patients but there is significant potential for rigorous research to understand the potential of mushrooms in human disease and thence to focus on appropriate clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness and or potential toxicity
