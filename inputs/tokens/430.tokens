betaglucans are a heterogeneous group of natural polysaccharides mostly investigated for their immunological effectsdue to the low systemic availability of oral preparations it has been thought that only parenterally applied betaglucans can modulate the immune systemhowever several in vivo and in vitro investigations have revealed that orally applied betaglucans also exert such effectsvarious receptor interactions explaining possible mode of actions have been detectedthe effects mainly depend on the source and structure of the betaglucansin the meantime several human clinical trials with dietary insoluble yeast betaglucans have been performedthe results confirm the previous findings of in vivo studiesthe results of all studies taken together clearly indicate that oral intake of insoluble yeast betaglucans is safe and has an immune strengthening effect
