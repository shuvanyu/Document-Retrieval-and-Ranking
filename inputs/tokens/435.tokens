purpose the effect of brewers yeast 1316betadglucan consumption on the number of common cold episodes in healthy subject was investigatedmethods in a placebocontrolled doubleblind randomized multicentric clinical trial 162 healthy participants with recurring infections received 900 mg of either placebo n  81 or an insoluble yeast 1316betadglucan preparation n  81 per day over a course of 16 weekssubjects were instructed to document each occurring common cold episode in a diary and to rate ten predefined infection symptoms during an infections period resulting in a symptom scorethe subjects were examined by the investigator during the episode visit on the 5th day of each cold episoderesults in the per protocol population supplementation with insoluble yeast 1316betaglucan reduced the number of symptomatic common cold infections by 25  as compared to placebo p  0041the mean symptom score was 15  lower in the betaglucan as opposed to the placebo group p  0125betaglucan significantly reduced sleep difficulties caused by cold episode as compared to placebo p  0028efficacy of yeast betaglucan was rated better than the placebo both by physicians p  0004 participants p  0012conclusion the present study demonstrated that yeast betaglucan preparation increased the bodys potential to defend against invading pathogens
