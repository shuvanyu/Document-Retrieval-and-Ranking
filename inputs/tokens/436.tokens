purpose there is evidence that dietary habits contribute to the presence and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldthe aim of the present study was to explore any associations between consumption of grains and the development and severity of nafldmethods seventythree consecutive nafld patients were enrolledadditionally 58 controls matched for age sex and body mass index with 58 patients were also includedconsumption of grains was estimated through a semiquantitative food frequency questionnairemedical history anthropometric indices body composition analysis physical activity data biochemical and inflammatory markers were available for all the participantsliver stiffness measurement by transient elastography was performed in 58 and liver biopsy in 34 patientsresults in patients consumption of whole grains was associated with lower abdominal fat level β  024 p  002 and lower levels of insulin resistance index β  028 p  0009 while it also correlated inversely with interleukin6 levels ρ  023 p  005consumption of whole grains was associated with lower likelihood of having histological steatohepatitis or 097 95 ci 0941000 after adjusting for sex and energy intake but the association became weaker after further adjusting for abdominal fat or interleukin6 levelsin the casecontrol analysis consumption of refined grains was associated with higher odds of having nafld or 1021 95 ci 10011042 after adjusting for age sex energy intake abdominal fat level homair ldl adiponectin and tnfαconclusions although refined grain consumption increased the likelihood of having nafld wholegrain consumption favorably affected clinical characteristics of patients with nafld and tended to be associated with less severe disease
