nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld is the most common liver disease in the united stateswhile the american association for the study of liver diseases guidelines define nafld as hepatic steatosis detected either on histology or imaging without a secondary cause of abnormal hepatic fat accumulation no imaging modality is recommended as standard of care for screening or diagnosisbedside ultrasound has been evaluated as a noninvasive method of diagnosing nafld with the presence of characteristic sonographic findingsprior studies suggest characteristic sonographic findings for nafld include bright hepatic echoes increased hepatorenal echogenicity vascular blurring of portal or hepatic vein and subcutaneous tissue thicknessthese sonographic characteristics have not been shown to aid bedside clinicians easily identify potential cases of nafldwhile sonographic findings such as attenuation of image diffuse echogenicity uniform heterogeneous liver thick subcutaneous depth and enlarged liver filling of the entire field could be identified by clinicians from bedside ultrasoundthe accessibility ease of use and lowside effect profile of ultrasound make bedside ultrasound an appealing imaging modality in the detection of hepatic steatosiswhen used with appropriate clinical risk factors and steatosis involves greater than 33 of the liver ultrasound can reliably diagnose naflddespite the ability of ultrasound in detecting moderate hepatic steatosis it cannot replace liver biopsy in staging the degree of fibrosisthe purpose of this review is to examine the diagnostic accuracy utility and limitations of ultrasound in the diagnosis of nafld and its potential use by clinicians in routine practices
