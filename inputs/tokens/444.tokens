although erbitux cetuximab has proven therapeutic benefit in the clinical setting the molecular determinants predicting responsiveness to this agent are still not very well understoodhere we assessed the relationship between basal total and activated py1068 epidermal growth factor receptor egfr levels in a tumor and the responsiveness to cetuximab monotherapy or combinationbased treatment using human xenograft modelscetuximab treatment alone 0251 mgmouseinjection q3d ipeffectively delayed the growth of geo and l2987 tumors by a minimum of 10 days corresponding to log cell kill values of or10borderline activity was seen in the a549 and widr xenograftshowever cetuximab failed to show any significant antitumor activity in the ht29 hct116 lovo colo205 lx1 hcc70 and n87 modelsall of the studied tumors had detectable yet variable levels of egfrfor combination regimens cetuximab 1 mgmouseinjection q3dx5 ipand cisplatin 45 mgkginjection q3dx5 ivproved to be significantly more efficacious than individual monotherapies in the cisplatinrefractory yet cetuximabresponsive geo tumor model p  0001however no therapeutic enhancement was observed in the cisplatin and cetuximab weakly responsive a549 xenograftsimilarly combinations of cpt11 48 mgkginjection q3dx5 ivwith cetuximab 1 mgmouseinjection q3dx5 ipfailed to show any improvements over individual monotherapies in the cetuximab resistantweakly responsive ht29 a549 and widr modelswe conclude that preclinical activity associated with cetuximab monotherapy does not correlate directly with relative basal levels of total or activated py1068 egfr in a tumormoreover robust singleagent activity by cetuximab may be the best predictor for this agent to potentiate chemotherapymediated antitumor activities
