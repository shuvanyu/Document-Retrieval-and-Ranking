the aim of this study was to evaluate the antiinflammatory effect of oatmeal extract oligomer on skin fragments stimulated by a neuromediator vasoactive intestinal peptide vipskin fragments from plastic surgery were maintained in survival conditions for 6 h to induce inflammation vip was placed in contact with dermis by culture mediumhistological analysis was then performed on hematoxylin and eosinstained slidesedema was evaluated with semiquantitative scoresvasodilation was studied by quantifying the percentage of dilated vessels according to scores and by measuring their surface by morphometrical image analysistnfalpha dosage was made on culture supernatantsvasodilation was significantly increased after application of vipafter treatment with oatmeal extract oligomer the mean surface of dilated vessels and edema were significantly decreased compared with viptreated skinmoreover treatment with this extract decreased tnfalpha
