the use of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumours is increasinghowever the tolerability profile for egfrinhibitors such as the monoclonal antibody cetuximab and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib is characterised by a unique group of skin reactions dominated by an acneiform eruption xerosis eczema and changes in the hair and nailsthe possibility that this skin toxicity correlates with antitumour activity offers the potential to titrate dosing on a casebycase basisthese skin effects may constitute a significant obstacle to treatment complianceaccordingly there is a need for consistent multidisciplinary management strategies that will allow patients to receive the recommended dosages of such targeted therapiesthe eruption responds well to some acne therapies and xerosis can be controlled by standard emollientshere we present an overview of the treatment options for skin reactions that are available today and evaluate some of the ways in which the treatment of such egfrinhibitorrelated skin reactions may be improved in the futureevidencebased studies are needed to determine the best way to manage these effects
