purpose the egfrindependent activation of the rasrafmekmapk pathway is one of the resistance mechanisms to cetuximabexperimental design we have evaluated in vitro and in vivo the effects of bay 869766 a selective mek12 inhibitor in a panel of human colorectal cancer cell lines with primary or acquired resistance to cetuximabresults among the colorectal cancer cell lines five with a kras mutation lovo hct116 hct15 sw620 and sw480 and one with a braf mutation ht29 were resistant to the antiproliferative effects of cetuximab whereas two cells geo and sw48 were highly sensitivetreatment with bay 869766 determined dosedependent growth inhibition in all cancer cells including two human colorectal cancer cells with acquired resistance to cetuximab geocr and sw48cr with the exception of hct15 cellscombined treatment with cetuximab and bay 869766 induced a synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic effects with blockade in the mapk and akt pathway in cells with either primary or acquired resistance to cetuximabthe synergistic antiproliferative effects were confirmed using other two selective mek12 inhibitors selumetinib and pimasertib in combination with cetuximabmoreover inhibition of mek expression by sirna restored cetuximab sensitivity in resistant cellsin nude mice bearing established human hct15 hct116 sw48cr and geocr xenografts the combined treatment with cetuximab and bay 869766 caused significant tumor growth inhibition and increased mice survivalconclusion these results suggest that activation of mek is involved in both primary and acquired resistance to cetuximab and the inhibition of egfr and mek could be a strategy for overcoming antiegfr resistance in patients with colorectal cancer2014 american association for cancer research
