a high intake of whole grain foods is associated with reduced risk of colon cancer but the mechanism underlying this protection has yet to be elucidatedchronic inflammation and associated cyclooxygenase2 cox2 expression in the colon epithelium are causally related to epithelial carcinogenesis proliferation and tumor growthwe examined the effect of avenanthramides avns unique polyphenols from oats with antiinflammatory properties on cox2 expression in macrophages colon cancer cell lines and on proliferation of human colon cancer cell lineswe found that avnsenriched extract of oats avexo had no effect on cox2 expression but it did inhibit cox enzyme activity and prostaglandin e2 pge2 production in lipopolysaccharidestimulated mouse peritoneal macrophagesavns avexo avnc and the methylated form of avnc ch3avnc significantly inhibited cell proliferation of both cox2positive ht29 caco2 and ls174t and cox2negative hct116 human colon cancer cell lines ch3avnc being the most potenthowever avns had no effect on cox2 expression and pge2 production in caco2 and ht29 colon cancer cellsthese results indicate that the inhibitory effect of avns on colon cancer cell proliferation may be independent of cox2 expression and pge2 productionthus avns might reduce colon cancer risk through inhibition of macrophage pge2 production and noncoxrelated antiproliferative effects in colon cancer cellsinterestingly avns had no effect on cell viability of confluenceinduced differentiated caco2 cells which display the characteristics of normal colonic epithelial cellsour results suggest that the consumption of oats and oat bran may reduce the risk of colon cancer not only because of their high fiber content but also due to avns which attenuate proliferation of colonic cancer cells
