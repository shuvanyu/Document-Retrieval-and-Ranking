a comprehensive ecologic survey of dietary lifestyle and mortality characteristics of 65 counties in rural china showed that diets are substantially richer in foods of plant origin when compared with diets consumed in the more industrialized western societiesmean intakes of animal protein about onetenth of the mean intake in the united states as energy percent total fat 145 of energy and dietary fiber 333 gd reflected a substantial preference for foods of plant originmean plasma cholesterol concentration at approximately 323349 mmoll corresponds to this dietary lifestylethe principal hypothesis under investigation in this paper is that chronic degenerative diseases are prevented by an aggregate effect of nutrients and nutrientintake amounts that are commonly supplied by foods of plant originthe breadth and consistency of evidence for this hypothesis was investigated with multiple intakebiomarkerdisease associations which were appropriately adjustedthere appears to be no threshold of plantfood enrichment or minimization of fat intake beyond which further disease prevention does not occurthese findings suggest that even small intakes of foods of animal origin are associated with significant increases in plasma cholesterol concentrations which are associated in turn with significant increases in chronic degenerative disease mortality rates
