phospholipids pls are a major class of lipid in rice grainalthough pls are only a minor nutrient compared to starch and protein they may have both nutritional and functional significancewe have systemically reviewed the literature on the class distribution and variation of pls in rice their relation to rice enduse quality and human health as well as available methods for analytical profilingphosphatidylcholine pc phosphatidylethanolamine pe phosphatidylinositol pi and their lyso forms are the major pls in ricethe deterioration of pc in rice bran during storage was considered as a trigger for the degradation of rice lipids with associated rancid flavour in paddy and brown ricethe lyso forms in rice endosperm represent the major starch lipid and may form inclusion complexes with amylose affecting the physicochemical properties and digestibility of starch and hence its cooking and eating qualitydietary pls have a positive impact on several human diseases and reduce the sideeffects of some drugsas rice has long been consumed as a staple food in many asian countries rice pls may have significant health benefits for those populationsrice pls may be influenced both by genetic g and environmental e factors and resolving ge interactions may allow future exploitation of pl composition and content thus boosting rice eating quality and health benefits for consumerswe have identified and summarised the different methods used for rice pl analysis and discussed the consequences of variation in reported pl values due to inconsistencies between methodsthis review enhances the understanding of the nature and importance of pls in rice and outlines potential approaches for manipulating pls to improve the quality of rice grain and other cerealscopyright  2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
