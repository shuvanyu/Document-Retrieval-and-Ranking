several studies have suggested a protective effect of intake of whole grains but not refined grains on type 2 diabetes risk but the doseresponse relationship between different types of grains and type 2 diabetes has not been establishedwe conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of prospective studies of grain intake and type 2 diabeteswe searched the pubmed database for studies of grain intake and risk of type 2 diabetes up to june 5th 2013summary relative risks were calculated using a random effects modelsixteen cohort studies were included in the analysesthe summary relative risk per 3 servings per day was 068 95 ci 058081 i2  82 n  10 for whole grains and 095 95 ci 088104 i2  53 n  6 for refined grainsa nonlinear association was observed for whole grains p nonlinearity  00001 but not for refined grains p nonlinearity  010inverse associations were observed for subtypes of whole grains including whole grain bread whole grain cereals wheat bran and brown rice but these results were based on few studies while white rice was associated with increased riskour metaanalysis suggests that a high whole grain intake but not refined grains is associated with reduced type 2 diabetes riskhowever a positive association with intake of white rice and inverse associations between several specific types of whole grains and type 2 diabetes warrant further investigationsour results support public health recommendations to replace refined grains with whole grains and suggest that at least two servings of whole grains per day should be consumed to reduce type 2 diabetes risk
