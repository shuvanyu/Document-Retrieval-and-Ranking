background fat and protein sources may influence whether lowcarbohydrate diets are associated with type 2 diabetes t2dobjective the objective was to compare the associations of 3 lowcarbohydrate diet scores with incident t2ddesign a prospective cohort study was conducted in participants from the health professionals followup study who were free of t2d cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline n  40475 for up to 20 ycumulative averages of 3 lowcarbohydrate diet scores high total protein and fat high animal protein and fat and high vegetable protein and fat were calculated every 4 y from foodfrequency questionnaires and were associated with incident t2d by using cox modelsresults we documented 2689 cases of t2d during followupafter adjustments for age smoking physical activity coffee intake alcohol intake family history of t2d total energy intake and body mass index the score for high animal protein and fat was associated with an increased risk of t2d top compared with bottom quintile hazard ratio hr 137 95 ci 120 158 p for trend  001adjustment for red and processed meat attenuated this association hr 111 95 ci 095 130 p for trend  020a high score for vegetable protein and fat was not significantly associated with the risk of t2d overall but was inversely associated with t2d in men aged 65 y hr 078 95 ci 066 092 p for trend  001 p for interaction  001conclusions a score representing a lowcarbohydrate diet high in animal protein and fat was positively associated with the risk of t2d in menlowcarbohydrate diets should obtain protein and fat from foods other than red and processed meat
