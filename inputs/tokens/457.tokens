six noninsulindependent diabetic subjects received meals containing 25 g carbohydrate either as potato or as spaghettithe meals were repeated with the addition of 25 g protein and with 25 g protein and 25 g fatblood glucose and insulin responses were measured for 4 h after the test mealwhen carbohydrate was given alone the blood glucose and serum insulin increments were higher for the potato mealthe addition of protein increased the insulin responses to both carbohydrates and slightly reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato f  204 p less than 005the further addition of fat reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato f  1463 p less than 0001 without any change in the blood glucose response to spaghetti f  094 nsthe different responses to coingestion of protein and fat reduced the difference between the glycemic responses to the two carbohydrates
