many changes in diet and in physical activity are occurring simultaneously in the developing worldthese diet shifts include large increases in energy density in the proportion of the population consuming a high fat diet and in animal product intakeanimal source foods asf play a major role in these diet shiftsthis article documents the large shifts in the composition of diets and obesity across the developing world and notes that these changes are acceleratingusing china as a case study evidence of the speeding up of this process is presented in descriptive and more rigorous dynamic longitudinal analysisthe implications of these changes for dietary and obesity patterns and cardiovascular disease are greatindeed developing countries are at a point where the prevalence of obesity is greater than that of undernutrition and concerns related to intake of saturated fat and energy imbalance must be considered more seriously by the agriculture sectorcurrent agriculture development policy in many developing countries focuses on livestock promotion and does not consider the potential adverse health consequences of this strategyalthough linkages between asf intake and obesity cannot be established as clearly as they are for high asf intakes heart disease and cancer the potential adverse health effects linked with an increased asf intake should no longer be ignored
