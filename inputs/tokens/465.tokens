new epidemiology confirms that glucose intolerance is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer and that this association cannot be accounted for by an adverse impact of early pancreatic cancer on beta cell functionprevious reports indicate that risk for pancreatic cancer is increased in adultonset diabeticssince streptozotocin diabetes inhibits carcinogenmediated induction of pancreatic cancer in hamsters the most reasonable interpretation of these findings is that insulin or some other beta cell product acts as a promoter for pancreatic carcinogenesisthis view is consistent with a report that human pancreatic adenocarcinomas express insulin receptors that can stimulate mitosis an additional possibility is that high insulin levels indirectly promote pancreatic carcinogenesis by boosting effective igfi activity via hepatic actionsin international ecologic epidemiology pancreatic cancer rates correlate tightly with dietary intake of animal products this may reflect the fact that vegan diets are associated with low diurnal insulin secretionthere is also suggestive evidence that macrobiotic vegan diets which are low in glycemic index may increase mean survival time in pancreatic cancerhowever other types of diets associated with decreased postprandial insulin response such as highprotein diets or mediterranean diets high in oleic acid may also have the potential for pancreatic cancer preventionthe huge increases of ageadjusted pancreatic cancer mortality in japan and among africanamericans during the last century imply that pancreatic cancer is substantially preventable a lowinsulinresponse diet coupled with exercise training weight control and smoking avoidance commendable for a great many other reasons may slash pancreatic cancer mortality dramaticallycopyright 2001 harcourt publishers ltd
