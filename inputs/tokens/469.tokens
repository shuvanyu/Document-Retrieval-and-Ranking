objective to examine whether high milk consumption is associated with mortality and fractures in women and mendesign cohort studiessetting three counties in central swedenparticipants two large swedish cohorts one with 61 433 women 3974 years at baseline 198790 and one with 45 339 men 4579 years at baseline 1997 were administered food frequency questionnairesthe women responded to a second food frequency questionnaire in 1997main outcome measure multivariable survival models were applied to determine the association between milk consumption and time to mortality or fractureresults during a mean followup of 201 years 15 541 women died and 17 252 had a fracture of whom 4259 had a hip fracturein the male cohort with a mean followup of 112 years 10 112 men died and 5066 had a fracture with 1166 hip fracture casesin women the adjusted mortality hazard ratio for three or more glasses of milk a day compared with less than one glass a day was 193 95 confidence interval 180 to 206for every glass of milk the adjusted hazard ratio of all cause mortality was 115 113 to 117 in women and 103 101 to 104 in menfor every glass of milk in women no reduction was observed in fracture risk with higher milk consumption for any fracture 102 100 to 104 or for hip fracture 109 105 to 113the corresponding adjusted hazard ratios in men were 101 099 to 103 and 103 099 to 107in subsamples of two additional cohorts one in males and one in females a positive association was seen between milk intake and both urine 8isopgf2α a biomarker of oxidative stress and serum interleukin 6 a main inflammatory biomarkerconclusions high milk intake was associated with higher mortality in one cohort of women and in another cohort of men and with higher fracture incidence in womengiven the observational study designs with the inherent possibility of residual confounding and reverse causation phenomena a cautious interpretation of the results is recommended
