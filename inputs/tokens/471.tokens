importance milk consumption during adolescence is recommended to promote peak bone mass and thereby reduce fracture risk in later lifehowever its role in hip fracture prevention is not established and high consumption may adversely influence risk by increasing heightobjective to determine whether milk consumption during teenage years influences risk of hip fracture in older adults and to investigate the role of attained height in this associationdesign prospective cohort study over 22 years of followup setting united states participants over 96000 caucasian postmenopausal women from the nurses health study and men age 50 and older from the health professionals followup study exposures frequency of consumption of milk and other foods during ages 1318 and attained height were reported at baselinecurrent diet weight smoking physical activity medication use and other risk factors for hip fractures were reported on biennial questionnairesmain outcome measures cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate relative risks rr of first incident hip fracture from lowtrauma events per glass 8 fl oz or 240 ml of milk consumed per day during teenage yearsresults over followup 1226 hip fractures were identified in women and 490 in menafter controlling for known risk factors and current milk consumption each additional glass of milk per day during teenage years was associated with a significant 9 higher risk of hip fracture in men rr109 95 ci 101117the association was attenuated when height was added to the model rr106 95 ci 098114teenage milk consumption was not associated with hip fractures in women rr100 95 ci 095105 per glass per dayconclusion and relevance greater milk consumption during teenage years was not associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adultsthe positive association observed in men was partially mediated through attained height
