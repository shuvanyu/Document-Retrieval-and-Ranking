summary this study evaluated bone health in adults with galactosemiaassociations between bone mineral density bmd and nutritional and biochemical variables were exploredcalcium level predicted hip and spine bmd and gonadotropin levels were inversely associated with spinal bmd in womenthese results afford insights into management strategies for these patientsintroduction bone loss is a complication of galactosemiadietary restriction primary ovarian insufficiency in women and diseaserelated alterations of bone metabolism may contributethis study examined relationships between clinical factors and bmd in patients with galactosemiamethods this crosssectional sample included 33 adults 16 women with classic galactosemia mean age 320  118 yearsbmd was measured by dualenergy xray absorptiometry and was correlated with age height weight fractures nutritional factors hormonal status and bone biomarkersresults there was a significant difference in hip bmd between women and men 0799 vs 0896 gcm2 p  0014the percentage of subjects with bmdz 20 was also greater for women than men 33 vs 18  spine 27 vs 6  hip and more women reported sustaining fracturesbivariate analyses yielded correlations between bmi and bmdz at the hip in women r  058 p  005 and spine in men r  053 p  005in women weight was also correlated with bmdz r  057 p  005 at hip and ctelopeptides r  059 at spine and 063 hip p  005 and osteocalcin r  071 at spine and 072 hip p  005 were inversely correlated with bmdzin final regression models higher gonadotropin levels were associated with lower spinal bmd in women p  0017 serum calcium was a significant predictor of hip p  0014 and spine p  0013 bmd in both sexesconclusions bone density in adults with galactosemia is low indicating the potential for increased fracture risk the etiology of which appears to be multifactorial
