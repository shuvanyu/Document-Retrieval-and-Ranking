background evidencebased medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiasedselective publication of clinical trialsand the outcomes within those trialscan lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent riskbenefit ratiomethods we obtained reviews from the food and drug administration fda for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12564 patientswe conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publicationsfor trials that were reported in the literature we compared the published outcomes with the fda outcomeswe also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire fda data setresults among 74 fdaregistered studies 31 accounting for 3449 study participants were not publishedwhether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcomea total of 37 studies viewed by the fda as having positive results were published 1 study viewed as positive was not publishedstudies viewed by the fda as having negative or questionable results were with 3 exceptions either not published 22 studies or published in a way that in our opinion conveyed a positive outcome 11 studiesaccording to the published literature it appeared that 94 of the trials conducted were positiveby contrast the fda analysis showed that 51 were positiveseparate metaanalyses of the fda and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69 for individual drugs and was 32 overallconclusions we cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish or bothselective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers study participants health care professionals and patientscopyright 2008 massachusetts medical society
