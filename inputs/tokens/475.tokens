is it ever right to prescribe placebos to patients in clinical practicethe general medical council is ambivalent about the issue the american medical association asserts that placebos can be administered only if the patient is somehow informedthe potential problem with placebos is that they may involve deception indeed if this is the case an ethical tension arises over the patients autonomy and the physicians requirement to be open and honest and the notion that medical care should be the primary concernthis paper examines the case of depression as an entry point for understanding the complexities of the prescription of placebosrecent important metaanalyses of antidepressants claim that they are not significantly more effective in a clinical setting than placebosgiven that antidepressants have numerous adverse side effects and are hugely expensive this provocative research has serious potential ethical and practical implications for patients and medical providersshould placebos be prescribed in place of antidepressantsthe case of depression highlights another important issue which medical ethical codes have hitherto overlooked wellbeing is not synonymous with being realistic about oneself ones circumstances and the futurewhile severely depressed individuals are unduly pessimistic about themselves and the world around them treatment of depressed individuals can be deemed successful when patients have successfully attained those positive illusions that are indicative of psychological healththis is exactly what successful psychological treatments of depression seem to achieveit is therefore possible that there may be a limited unavoidable role for deception in medicine
