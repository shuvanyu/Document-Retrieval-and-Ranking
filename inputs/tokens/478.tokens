background metaanalyses of antidepressant medications have reported only modest benefits over placebo treatment and when unpublished trial data are included the benefit falls below accepted criteria for clinical significanceyet the efficacy of the antidepressants may also depend on the severity of initial depression scoresthe purpose of this analysis is to establish the relation of baseline severity and antidepressant efficacy using a relevant dataset of published and unpublished clinical trialsmethods and findings we obtained data on all clinical trials submitted to the us food and drug administration fda for the licensing of the four newgeneration antidepressants for which full datasets were availablewe then used metaanalytic techniques to assess linear and quadratic effects of initial severity on improvement scores for drug and placebo groups and on drugplacebo difference scoresdrugplacebo differences increased as a function of initial severity rising from virtually no difference at moderate levels of initial depression to a relatively small difference for patients with very severe depression reaching conventional criteria for clinical significance only for patients at the upper end of the very severely depressed categorymetaregression analyses indicated that the relation of baseline severity and improvement was curvilinear in drug groups and showed a strong negative linear component in placebo groupsconclusions drugplacebo differences in antidepressant efficacy increase as a function of baseline severity but are relatively small even for severely depressed patientsthe relationship between initial severity and antidepressant efficacy is attributable to decreased responsiveness to placebo among very severely depressed patients rather than to increased responsiveness to medicationeditors summary backgroundeveryone feels miserable occasionallybut for some peoplethose with depressionthese sad feelings last for months or years and interfere with daily lifedepression is a serious medical illness caused by imbalances in the brain chemicals that regulate moodit affects one in six people at some time during their life making them feel hopeless worthless unmotivated even suicidaldoctors measure the severity of depression using the hamilton rating scale of depression hrsd a 1721 item questionnairethe answers to each question are given a score and a total score for the questionnaire of more than 18 indicates severe depressionmild depression is often treated with psychotherapy or talk therapy for example cognitivebehavioral therapy helps people to change negative ways of thinking and behavingfor more severe depression current treatment is usually a combination of psychotherapy and an antidepressant drug which is hypothesized to normalize the brain chemicals that affect moodantidepressants include tricyclics monoamine oxidases and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssrisssris are the newest antidepressants and include fluoxetine venlafaxine nefazodone and paroxetinewhy was this study donealthough the us food and drug administration fda the uk national institute for health and clinical excellence nice and other licensing authorities have approved ssris for the treatment of depression some doubts remain about their clinical efficacybefore an antidepressant is approved for use in patients it must undergo clinical trials that compare its ability to improve the hrsd scores of patients with that of a placebo a dummy tablet that contains no drugeach individual trial provides some information about the new drugs effectiveness but additional information can be gained by combining the results of all the trials in a metaanalysis a statistical method for combining the results of many studiesa previously published metaanalysis of the published and unpublished trials on ssris submitted to the fda during licensing has indicated that these drugs have only a marginal clinical benefiton average the ssris improved the hrsd score of patients by 18 points more than the placebo whereas nice has defined a significant clinical benefit for antidepressants as a drugplacebo difference in the improvement of the hrsd score of 3 pointshowever average improvement scores may obscure beneficial effects between different groups of patient so in the metaanalysis in this paper the researchers investigated whether the baseline severity of depression affects antidepressant efficacywhat did the researchers do and findthe researchers obtained data on all the clinical trials submitted to the fda for the licensing of fluoxetine venlafaxine nefazodone and paroxetinethey then used metaanalytic techniques to investigate whether the initial severity of depression affected the hrsd improvement scores for the drug and placebo groups in these trialsthey confirmed first that the overall effect of these new generation of antidepressants was below the recommended criteria for clinical significancethen they showed that there was virtually no difference in the improvement scores for drug and placebo in patients with moderate depression and only a small and clinically insignificant difference among patients with very severe depressionthe difference in improvement between the antidepressant and placebo reached clinical significance however in patients with initial hrsd scores of more than 28that is in the most severely depressed patientsadditional analyses indicated that the apparent clinical effectiveness of the antidepressants among these most severely depressed patients reflected a decreased responsiveness to placebo rather than an increased responsiveness to antidepressantswhat do these findings meanthese findings suggest that compared with placebo the newgeneration antidepressants do not produce clinically significant improvements in depression in patients who initially have moderate or even very severe depression but show significant effects only in the most severely depressed patientsthe findings also show that the effect for these patients seems to be due to decreased responsiveness to placebo rather than increased responsiveness to medicationgiven these results the researchers conclude that there is little reason to prescribe newgeneration antidepressant medications to any but the most severely depressed patients unless alternative treatments have been ineffectivein addition the finding that extremely depressed patients are less responsive to placebo than less severely depressed patients but have similar responses to antidepressants is a potentially important insight into how patients with depression respond to antidepressants and placebos that should be investigated furtheradditional
