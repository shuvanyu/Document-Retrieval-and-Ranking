antidepressant medications are the firstline treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disordermost antidepressants are designed to perturb the mechanisms that regulate the neurotransmitter serotonin  an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants animals and fungimany adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin including emotion development neuronal growth and death platelet activation and the clotting process attention electrolyte balance and reproductionit is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioningbecause serotonin regulates many adaptive processes antidepressants could have many adverse health effectsfor instance while antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing depressive symptoms they increase the brains susceptibility to future episodes after they have been discontinuedcontrary to a widely held belief in psychiatry studies that purport to show that antidepressants promote neurogenesis are flawed because they all use a method that cannot by itself distinguish between neurogenesis and neuronal deathin fact antidepressants cause neuronal damage and mature neurons to revert to an immature state both of which may explain why antidepressants also cause neurons to undergo apoptosis programmed deathantidepressants can also cause developmental problems they have adverse effects on sexual and romantic life and they increase the risk of hyponatremia low sodium in the blood plasma bleeding stroke and death in the elderlyour review supports the conclusion that antidepressants generally do more harm than good by disrupting a number of adaptive processes regulated by serotoninhowever there may be specific conditions for which their use is warranted eg cancer recovery from strokewe conclude that altered informed consent practices and greater caution in the prescription of antidepressants are warranted
