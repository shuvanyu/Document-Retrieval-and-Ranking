background previous observational and interventional studies have suggested that regular physical exercise may be associated with reduced symptoms of depressionhowever the extent to which exercise training may reduce depressive symptoms in older patients with major depressive disorder mdd has not been systematically evaluatedobjective to assess the effectiveness of an aerobic exercise program compared with standard medication ie antidepressants for treatment of mdd in older patients we conducted a 16week randomized controlled trialmethods one hundred fiftysix men and women with mdd age  or  50 years were assigned randomly to a program of aerobic exercise antidepressants sertraline hydrochloride or combined exercise and medicationsubjects underwent comprehensive evaluations of depression including the presence and severity of mdd using diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition criteria and hamilton rating scale for depression hamd and beck depression inventory bdi scores before and after treatmentsecondary outcome measures included aerobic capacity life satisfaction selfesteem anxiety and dysfunctional cognitionsresults after 16 weeks of treatment the groups did not differ statistically on hamd or bdi scores p  67 adjustment for baseline levels of depression yielded an essentially identical resultgrowth curve models revealed that all groups exhibited statistically and clinically significant reductions on hamd and bdi scoreshowever patients receiving medication alone exhibited the fastest initial response among patients receiving combination therapy those with less severe depressive symptoms initially showed a more rapid response than those with initially more severe depressive symptomsconclusions an exercise training program may be considered an alternative to antidepressants for treatment of depression in older personsalthough antidepressants may facilitate a more rapid initial therapeutic response than exercise after 16 weeks of treatment exercise was equally effective in reducing depression among patients with mdd
