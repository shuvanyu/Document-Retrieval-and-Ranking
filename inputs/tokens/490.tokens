objective to assess whether patients receiving aerobic exercise training performed either at home or in a supervised group setting achieve reductions in depression comparable to standard antidepressant medication sertraline and greater reductions in depression compared to placebo controlsmethods between october 2000 and november 2005 we performed a prospective randomized controlled trial smile study with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment in a tertiary care teaching hospitala total of 202 adults 153 women 49 men diagnosed with major depression were assigned randomly to one of four conditions supervised exercise in a group setting homebased exercise antidepressant medication sertraline 50200 mg daily or placebo pill for 16 weekspatients underwent the structured clinical interview for depression and completed the hamilton depression rating scale hamdresults after 4 months of treatment 41 of the participants achieved remission defined as no longer meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder mdd and a hamd score of 8patients receiving active treatments tended to have higher remission rates than the placebo controls supervised exercise  45 homebased exercise  40 medication  47 placebo  31 p  057all treatment groups had lower hamd scores after treatment scores for the active treatment groups were not significantly different from the placebo group p  23conclusions the efficacy of exercise in patients seems generally comparable with patients receiving antidepressant medication and both tend to be better than the placebo in patients with mddplacebo response rates were high suggesting that a considerable portion of the therapeutic response is determined by patient expectations ongoing symptom monitoring attention and other nonspecific factors
