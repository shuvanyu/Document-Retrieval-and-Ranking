my concern about diet as a public health problem began in the early 1950s in naples where we observed very low incidences of coronary heart disease associated with what we later came to call the good mediterranean dietthe heart of this diet is mainly vegetarian and differs from american and northern european diets in that it is much lower in meat and dairy products and uses fruit for dessertthese observations led to our subsequent research in the seven countries study in which we demonstrated that saturated fat is the major dietary villaintoday the healthy mediterranean diet is changing and coronary heart disease is no longer confined to medical textbooksour challenge is to persuade children to tell their parents to eat as mediterraneans do
