hit reaction time latencies hrt in the continuous performance test cpt measure the speed of visual information processingthe latencies may involve different neuropsychological functions depending on the time from test initiation ie first orientation learning and habituation then cognitive processing and focused attention and finally sustained attention as the dominant demandprenatal methylmercury exposure is associated with increased reaction time rt latencieswe therefore examined the association of methylmercury exposure with the average hrt at age 14 years at three different time intervals after test initiationa total of 878 adolescents 87 of birth cohort members completed the cptthe rt latencies were recorded for 10 minutes with visual targets presented at 1000 ms intervalsafter confounder adjustment regression coefficients showed that cptrt outcomes differed in their associations with exposure biomarkers of prenatal methylmercury exposure during the first two minutes the average hrt was weakly associated with methylmercury beta se for a tenfold increase in exposure 341 206 was strongly for the 3to6 minute interval 610 218 and the strongest during 710 minutes after test initiation 764 239this pattern was unchanged when simple reaction time and finger tapping speed were included in the models as covariatespostnatal methylmercury exposures did not affect the outcomesthus these findings suggest that sustained attention as a neuropsychological domain is particularly vulnerable to developmental methylmercury exposure indicating probable underlying dysfunction of the frontal lobeswhen using cpt data as a possible measure of neurotoxicity test results should therefore be analyzed in regard to time from test initiation and not as overall average reaction times
