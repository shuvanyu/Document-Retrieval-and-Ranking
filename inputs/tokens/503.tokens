perhaps one of the most unexpected and novel findings in nutritional epidemiology in the past 5 y has been that nut consumption seems to protect against ischemic heart disease ihdfrequency and quantity of nut consumption have been documented to be higher in vegetarian than in nonvegetarian populationsnuts also constitute an important part of other plantbased diets such as mediterranean and asian dietsin a large prospective epidemiologic study of seventhday adventists in california we found that frequency of nut consumption had a substantial and highly significant inverse association with risk of myocardial infarction and death from ihdthe iowa womens health study also documented an association between nut consumption and decreased risk of ihdthe protective effect of nuts on ihd has been found in men and women and in the elderlyimportantly nuts have similar associations in both vegetarians and nonvegetariansthe protective effect of nut consumption on ihd is not offset by increased mortality from other causesmoreover frequency of nut consumption has been found to be inversely related to allcause mortality in several population groups such as whites blacks and the elderlythus nut consumption may not only offer protection against ihd but also increase longevity
