background and aims the intake of antioxidantrich foods may increase the blood levels of non enzymatic antioxidant capacity neacneac takes into account all antioxidants from food and synergistic effects between themwe examined the effect of a 1year intervention with mediterranean diet on plasma neac and assessed whether it was related to baseline neac levelsmethods and results five hundred sixtyfour participants at high cardiovascular risk were randomly selected from the predimed prevención con dieta mediterránea study a large 3arm randomized clinical trialblood neac levels were measured at baseline and after 1year of dietary intervention with 1 a mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil med  voo 2 a mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts med  nuts or 3 a control lowfat dietplasma neac was analyzed using frap ferric reducing antioxidant potential and trap total radicaltrapping antioxidant parameter assaysplasma frap levels increased after 1year of intervention with med  voo 720 μmoll 95 ci 3421099 and med  nuts 489 μmoll 243735 but not after the control lowfat diet 139 μmoll 119 to 398participants in the lowest quartile of plasma frap at baseline significantly increased their levels after any intervention while those in the highest quartile decreasedsimilar results occurred with trap levelsconclusions this study shows that a 1year of med diet intervention increases plasma tac level in subjects at high risk for cardiovascular diseasemoreover the effectiveness of dietary supplementation with antioxidants may be related to baseline levels of plasma neac 2013 elsevier bv all rights reserved
