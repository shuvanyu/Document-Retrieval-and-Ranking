background epidemiologic studies have shown inverse associations between nut consumption and diabetes cardiovascular disease cvd and allcause mortality but results have not been consistentobjective we assessed the relation between nut intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes cvd and allcause mortalitydesign we searched pubmed and embase for all prospective cohort studies published up to march 2013 with rrs and 95 cis for outcomes of interesta randomeffects model was used to pool risk estimates across studiesresults in 31 reports from 18 prospective studies there were 12655 type 2 diabetes 8862 cvd 6623 ischemic heart disease ihd 6487 stroke and 48818 mortality casesthe rr for each incremental serving per day of nut intake was 080 95 ci 069 094 for type 2 diabetes without adjustment for body mass index with adjustment the association was attenuated rr 103 95 ci 091 116 nsin the multivariableadjusted model pooled rrs 95 cis for each serving per day of nut consumption were 072 064 081 for ihd 071 059 085 for cvd and 083 076 091 for allcause mortalitypooled rrs 95 cis for the comparison of extreme quantiles of nut intake were 100 084 119 ns for type 2 diabetes 066 055 078 for ihd 070 060 081 for cvd 091 081 102 ns for stroke and 085 079 091 for allcause mortalityconclusions our metaanalysis indicates that nut intake is inversely associated with ihd overall cvd and allcause mortality but not significantly associated with diabetes and strokethe inverse association between the consumption of nuts and diabetes was attenuated after adjustment for body mass indexthese findings support recommendations to include nuts as part of a healthy dietary pattern for the prevention of chronic diseases 2014 american society for nutrition
