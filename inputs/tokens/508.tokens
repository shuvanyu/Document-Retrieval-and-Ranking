background  aims metabolic syndrome mets in which a nonclassic feature is an increase in systemic oxidative biomarkers presents a high risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvdadherence to the mediterranean diet meddiet is associated with a reduced risk of metshowever the effect of the meddiet on biomarkers for oxidative damage has not been assessed in mets individualswe have investigated the effect of the meddiet on systemic oxidative biomarkers in mets individualsmethods randomized controlled parallel clinical trial in which 110 female with mets aged 5580 were recruited into a large trial predimed study to test the efficacy of the traditional meddiet on the primary prevention of cvdparticipants were assigned to a lowfat diet or two traditional meddiets meddiet  virgin olive oil or meddiet  nutsboth meddiet group participants received nutritional education and either free extra virgin olive oil for all the family 1 lweek or free nuts 30 gdaydiets were ad libitumchanges in urine levels of f2isoprostane f2ip and the dna damage base 8oxo78dihydro2deoxyguanosine 8oxodg were evaluated at 1year trialresults after 1year urinary f2ip decreased in all groups the decrease in meddiet groups reaching a borderline significance versus that of the control groupurinary 8oxodg was also reduced in all groups with a higher decrease in both meddiet groups versus the control one p  0001conclusions meddiet reduces oxidative damage to lipids and dna in mets individualsdata from this study provide evidence to recommend the traditional meddiet as a useful tool in the mets managementregistered under clinical trialsgov identifier nonct00123456copyright  2012 elsevier ltd and european society for clinical nutrition and metabolismall rights reserved
