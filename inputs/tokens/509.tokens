background it is unknown whether individuals at high cardiovascular risk sustain a benefit in cardiovascular disease from increased olive oil consumptionthe aim was to assess the association between total olive oil intake its varieties extra virgin and common olive oil and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in a mediterranean population at high cardiovascular riskmethods we included 7216 men and women at high cardiovascular risk aged 55 to 80 years from the prevención con dieta mediterránea predimed study a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trialparticipants were randomized to one of three interventions mediterranean diets supplemented with nuts or extravirgin olive oil or a control lowfat dietthe present analysis was conducted as an observational prospective cohort studythe median followup was 48 yearscardiovascular disease stroke myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death and mortality were ascertained by medical records and national death indexolive oil consumption was evaluated with validated food frequency questionnairesmultivariate cox proportional hazards and generalized estimating equations were used to assess the association between baseline and yearly repeated measurements of olive oil intake cardiovascular disease and mortalityresults during followup 277 cardiovascular events and 323 deaths occurredparticipants in the highest energyadjusted tertile of baseline total olive oil and extravirgin olive oil consumption had 35 hr 065 95 ci 047 to 089 and 39 hr 061 95 ci 044 to 085 cardiovascular disease risk reduction respectively compared to the referencehigher baseline total olive oil consumption was associated with 48 hr 052 95 ci 029 to 093 reduced risk of cardiovascular mortalityfor each 10 gd increase in extravirgin olive oil consumption cardiovascular disease and mortality risk decreased by 10 and 7 respectivelyno significant associations were found for cancer and allcause mortalitythe associations between cardiovascular events and extra virgin olive oil intake were significant in the mediterranean diet intervention groups and not in the control groupconclusions olive oil consumption specifically the extravirgin variety is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risktrial registration this study was registered at controlledtrialscom httpwwwcontrolledtrialscomisrctn35739639international standard randomized controlled trial number isrctn 35739639registration date 5 october 2005
