objective the prevención con dieta mediterránea predimed trial showed that a mediterranean diet meddiet supplemented with either extra virgin olive oil or 30 gd of mixed nuts reduced incident cardiovascular events compared with a control low fat dietthe mechanisms of cardiovascular protection afforded by meddiets remain to be uncoveredwe assessed the effect of both supplemented meddiets on internal carotid intimamedia thickness icaimt and plaque height the ultrasound features that best predict future cardiovascular events in subjects at high cardiovascular riskapproach and results in a predimed subcohort n175 plaque height and carotid imt of 3 prespecified segments ica bifurcation and common were sonographically assessed at baseline and after intervention for a mean of 24 yearswe evaluated 164 subjects with complete datain a multivariate model mean icaimt progressed in the control diet group mean 95 confidence interval 0052 mm 0014 to 0118 mm whereas it regressed in the meddietnuts group 0084 mm 0158 to 0010 mm p0024 versus controlsimilar results were observed for maximum icaimt control 0188 mm 0077 to 0299 mm meddietnuts 0030 mm 0153 to 0093 mm p0034 and maximum plaque height control 0106 mm 0001 to 0210 mm meddietnuts 0091 mm 0206 to 0023 mm p0047there were no changes in icaimt or plaque after the meddietextra virgin olive oilconclusions compared with a control diet consumption of a meddiet supplemented with nuts is associated with delayed progression of icaimt and plaquethe results contribute mechanistic evidence for the reduction of cardiovascular events observed in the predimed trialclinical trial registration url httpwwwcontrolledtrialscomunique identifier isrctn35739639
