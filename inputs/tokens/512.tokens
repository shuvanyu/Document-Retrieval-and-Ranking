in a prospective randomised singleblinded secondary prevention trial we compared the effect of a mediterranean alphalinolenic acidrich diet to the usual postinfarct prudent dietafter a first myocardial infarction patients were randomly assigned to the experimental n  302 or control group n  303patients were seen again 8 weeks after randomisation and each year for 5 yearsthe experimental group consumed significantly less lipids saturated fat cholesterol and linoleic acid but more oleic and alphalinolenic acids confirmed by measurements in plasmaserum lipids blood pressure and body mass index remained similar in the 2 groupsin the experimental group plasma levels of albumin vitamin e and vitamin c were increased and granulocyte count decreasedafter a mean follow up of 27 months there were 16 cardiac deaths in the control and 3 in the experimental group 17 nonfatal myocardial infarction in the control and 5 in the experimental groups a risk ratio for these two main endpoints combined of 027 95 ci 012059 p  0001 after adjustment for prognostic variablesoverall mortality was 20 in the control 8 in the experimental group an adjusted risk ratio of 030 95 ci 011082 p  002an alphalinolenic acidrich mediterranean diet seems to be more efficient than presently used diets in the secondary prevention of coronary events and death
