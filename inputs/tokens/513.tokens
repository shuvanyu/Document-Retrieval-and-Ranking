human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the omega6 and omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa and was high in antioxidantsedible wild plants provide alphalinolenic acid ala and higher amounts of vitamin e and vitamin c than cultivated plantsin addition to the antioxidant vitamins edible wild plants are rich in phenols and other compounds that increase their antioxidant capacityit is therefore important to systematically analyze the total antioxidant capacity of wild plants and promote their commercialization in both developed and developing countriesthe diets of western countries have contained increasingly larger amounts of linoleic acid la which has been promoted for its cholesterollowering effectit is now recognized that dietary la favors oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and increases platelet response to aggregationin contrast ala intake is associated with inhibitory effects on the clotting activity of platelets on their response to thrombin and on the regulation of arachidonic acid aa metabolismin clinical studies ala contributed to lowering of blood pressure and a prospective epidemiological study showed that ala is inversely related to the risk of coronary heart disease in mendietary amounts of la as well as the ratio of la to ala appear to be important for the metabolism of ala to longerchain omega3 pufasrelatively large reserves of la in body fatas are found in vegans or in the diet of omnivores in western societies would tend to slow down the formation of longchain omega3 fatty acids from alatherefore the role of ala in human nutrition becomes important in terms of longterm dietary intakeone advantage of the consumption of ala over omega3 fatty acids from fish is that the problem of insufficient vitamin e intake does not exist with high intake of ala from plant sources
