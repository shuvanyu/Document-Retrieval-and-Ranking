background the lyon diet heart study is a randomized secondary prevention trial aimed at testing whether a mediterraneantype diet may reduce the rate of recurrence after a first myocardial infarctionan intermediate analysis showed a striking protective effect after 27 months of followupthis report presents results of an extended followup with a mean of 46 months per patient and deals with the relationships of dietary patterns and traditional risk factors with recurrencemethods and results three composite outcomes cos combining either cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction co 1 or the preceding plus major secondary end points unstable angina stroke heart failure pulmonary or peripheral embolism co 2 or the preceding plus minor events requiring hospital admission co 3 were studiedin the mediterranean diet group co 1 was reduced 14 events versus 44 in the prudent westerntype diet group p00001 as were co 2 27 events versus 90 p00001 and co 3 95 events versus 180 p00002adjusted risk ratios ranged from 028 to 053among the traditional risk factors total cholesterol 1 mmoll being associated with an increased risk of 18 to 28 systolic blood pressure 1 mm hg being associated with an increased risk of 1 to 2 leukocyte count adjusted risk ratios ranging from 164 to 286 with count 9x109l female sex adjusted risk ratios 027 to 046 and aspirin use adjusted risk ratios 059 to 082 were each significantly and independently associated with recurrenceconclusions the protective effect of the mediterranean dietary pattern was maintained up to 4 years after the first infarction confirming previous intermediate analysesmajor traditional risk factors such as high blood cholesterol and blood pressure were shown to be independent and joint predictors of recurrence indicating that the mediterranean dietary pattern did not alter at least qualitatively the usual relationships between major risk factors and recurrencethus a comprehensive strategy to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality should include primarily a cardioprotective dietit should be associated with other pharmacologicalmeans aimed at reducing modifiable risk factorsfurther trials combining the 2 approaches are warranted
