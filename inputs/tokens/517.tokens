the link between iron intake as well as body iron stores and coronary heart disease chd has been contentiously debated and the epidemiologic evidence is inconsistentwe aimed to quantitatively summarize the literature on the association between dietary iron intakebody iron stores and chd risk by conducting a metaanalysis of prospective cohort studiespubmed was used to find studies published through june 2013 in peerreviewed journalsembase or a hand search of relevant articles was used to obtain additional articlesthe pooled rrs of chd incidence and mortality with 95 cis were calculated by using either a randomeffects or fixedeffects model as appropriatetwentyone eligible studies 32 cohorts including 292454 participants with an average of 102 y of followup were includedheme iron was found to be positively associated with chd incidence rr 157 95 ci 128 194 whereas total iron was inversely associated rr 085 95 ci 073 0999neither hemeiron nor total iron intakes were significantly associated with chd mortalityboth transferrin saturation and serum iron were inversely related to chd incidence rr 95 ci 076 066 088 and 068 056 082 respectively but only transferrin saturation was inversely associated with chd mortality rr 085 95 ci 073 099in conclusion total iron intake and serum iron concentrations were inversely associated with chd incidence but heme iron intake was positively related to chd incidenceelevated serum transferrin saturation concentration was inversely associated with both chd incidence and mortalityfuture research is needed to establish the causal relation and to elucidate potential mechanisms
