background several epidemiological studies have observed an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm among subjects with a higher consumption of red and processed meatheme iron intake has been directly associated with a higher risk of t2dm in healthy adult chinese and us populationsthe objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between heme iron intake and the incidence of t2dm in a mediterranean population at high cardiovascular riskmethods we assessed a subset of participants in the predimed trial as an observational cohort followed up for a maximum of eight yearswe initially included 1073 nondiabetic subjects 571 women aged 673  60 years at high cardiovascular riskdiet was assessed at the study baseline using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaireresults during the followup period 131 diabetics were newly diagnosedthe risk of developing t2dm was assessed using baseline heme iron intake and proportional hazard models first unadjusted then adjusted for energy and finally adjusted for dietary anthropometric sociodemographic and lifestyle variablessignificant direct associations with the incidence of t2dm were found for heme iron hazard ratio hr 130 95 confidence interval ci 102 to 166secondarily we have also observed that coffee hr093 95 ci 089 to 098 and alcoholic beverages hr 102 95 ci 101 to 104 were also found to reduce and increase the risk of t2dm respectivelyconclusion high dietary intake of heme iron was associated with an increased risk of developing t2dm in a mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risktrial registration identifier isrctn35739639
