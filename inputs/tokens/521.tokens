background polyphenols may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease cvd and other chronic diseases due to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties as well as their beneficial effects on blood pressure lipids and insulin resistancehowever no previous epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between the intake of total polyphenols intake and polyphenol subclasses with overall mortalityour aim was to evaluate whether polyphenol intake is associated with allcause mortality in subjects at high cardiovascular riskmethods we used data from the predimed study a 7447participant parallelgroup randomized multicenter controlled fiveyear feeding trial aimed at assessing the effects of the mediterranean diet in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseasepolyphenol intake was calculated by matching food consumption data from repeated food frequency questionnaires ffq with the phenolexplorer database on the polyphenol content of each reported foodhazard ratios hr and 95 confidence intervals ci between polyphenol intake and mortality were estimated using timedependent cox proportional hazard modelsresults over an average of 48 years of followup we observed 327 deathsafter multivariate adjustment we found a 37 relative reduction in allcause mortality comparing the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total polyphenol intake hazard ratio hr  063 95 ci 041 to 097 p for trend  012among the polyphenol subclasses stilbenes and lignans were significantly associated with reduced allcause mortality hr 048 95 ci 025 to 091 p for trend  004 and hr  060 95 ci 037 to 097 p for trend  003 respectively with no significant associations apparent in the rest flavonoids or phenolic acidsconclusions among highrisk subjects those who reported a high polyphenol intake especially of stilbenes and lignans showed a reduced risk of overall mortality compared to those with lower intakesthese results may be useful to determine optimal polyphenol intake or specific food sources of polyphenols that may reduce the risk of allcause mortalityclinical trial registration isrctn35739639
