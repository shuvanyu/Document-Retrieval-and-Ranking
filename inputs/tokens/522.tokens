the relation between dietary magnesium intake and cardiovascular disease cvd or mortality was evaluated in several prospective studies but few of them have assessed the risk of allcause mortality which has never been evaluated in mediterranean adults at high cardiovascular riskthe aim of this study was to assess the association between magnesium intake and cvd and mortality risk in a mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk with high average magnesium intakethe present study included 7216 men and women aged 5580 y from the predimed prevención con dieta mediterránea study a randomized clinical trialparticipants were assigned to 1 of 2 mediterranean diets supplemented with nuts or olive oil or to a control diet advice on a lowfat dietmortality was ascertained by linkage to the national death index and medical recordswe fitted multivariableadjusted cox regressions to assess associations between baseline energyadjusted tertiles of magnesium intake and relative risk of cvd and mortalitymultivariable analyses with generalized estimating equation models were used to assess the associations between yearly repeated measurements of magnesium intake and mortalityafter a median followup of 48 y 323 total deaths 81 cardiovascular deaths 130 cancer deaths and 277 cardiovascular events occurredenergyadjusted baseline magnesium intake was inversely associated with cardiovascular cancer and allcause mortalitycompared with lower consumers individuals in the highest tertile of magnesium intake had a 34 reduction in mortality risk hr 066 95 ci 045 095 p  001dietary magnesium intake was inversely associated with mortality risk in mediterranean individuals at high risk of cvdthis trial was registered at controlledtrialscom as isrctn35739639
