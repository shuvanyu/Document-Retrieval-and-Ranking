the human orogastrointestinal gi tract is a complex system consisting of oral cavity pharynx oesophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and anus which all together with the accessory digestive organs constitute the digestive systemthe function of the digestive system is to break down dietary constituents into small molecules and then absorb these for subsequent distribution throughout the bodybesides digestion and carbohydrate metabolism the indigenous microbiota has an important influence on host physiological nutritional and immunological processes and commensal bacteria are able to modulate the expression of host genes that regulate diverse and fundamental physiological functionsthe main external factors that can affect the composition of the microbial community in generally healthy adults include major dietary changes and antibiotic therapychanges in some selected bacterial groups have been observed due to controlled changes to the normal diet eghighprotein diet highfat diet prebiotics probiotics and polyphenolsmore specifically changes in the type and quantity of nondigestible carbohydrates in the human diet influence both the metabolic products formed in the lower regions of the gi tract and the bacterial populations detected in faecesthe interactions between dietary factors gut microbiota and host metabolism are increasingly demonstrated to be important for maintaining homeostasis and healththerefore the aim of this review is to summarise the effect of diet and especially dietary interventions on the human gut microbiotafurthermore the most important confounding factors methodologies used and intrinsic human factors in relation to gut microbiota analyses are elucidated
