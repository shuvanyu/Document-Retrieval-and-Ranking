backgroundobjectives consisting of 1014 microbial cells the intestinal microbiota represents the largest and the most complex microbial community inhabiting the human bodyhowever the influence of regular diets on the microbiota is widely unknownsubjectsmethods we examined faecal samples of vegetarians n144 vegans n105 and an equal number of control subjects consuming ordinary omnivorous diet who were matched for age and genderwe used classical bacteriological isolation identification and enumeration of the main anaerobic and aerobic bacterial genera and computed absolute and relative numbers that were compared between groupsresults total counts of bacteroides spp bifidobacterium spp escherichia coli and enterobacteriaceae sppwere significantly lower p0001 p0002 p0006 and p0008 respectively in vegan samples than in controls whereas others e coli biovars klebsiella spp enterobacter spp other enterobacteriaceae enterococcus spp lactobacillus spp citrobacter sppand clostridium sppwere notsubjects on a vegetarian diet ranked between vegans and controlsthe total microbial count did not differ between the groupsin addition subjects on a vegan or vegetarian diet showed significantly p00001 lower stool ph than did controls and stool ph and counts of e coli and enterobacteriaceae were significantly correlated across all subgroupsconclusions maintaining a strict vegan or vegetarian diet results in a significant shift in the microbiota while total cell numbers remain unaltered
