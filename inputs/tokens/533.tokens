background epidemiologic studies have suggested that most cases of sporadic colon cancer can be attributed to dietthe recognition that colonic microbiota have a major influence on colonic health suggests that they might mediate colonic carcinogenesisobjective to examine the hypothesis that the influence of diet on colon cancer risk is mediated by the microbiota through their metabolites we measured differences in colonic microbes and their metabolites in african americans with a high risk and in rural native africans with a low risk of colon cancerdesign fresh fecal samples were collected from 12 healthy african americans aged 5065 y and from 12 age and sexmatched native africansmicrobiomes were analyzed with 16s ribosomal rna gene pyrosequencing together with quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the major fermentative butyrateproducing and bile aciddeconjugating bacteriafecal shortchain fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography and bile acids by liquid chromatographymass spectrometryresults microbial composition was fundamentally different with a predominance of prevotella in native africans enterotype 2 and of bacteroides in african americans enterotype 1total bacteria and major butyrateproducing groups were significantly more abundant in fecal samples from native africansmicrobial genes encoding for secondary bile acid production were more abundant in african americans whereas those encoding for methanogenesis and hydrogen sulfide production were higher in native africansfecal secondary bile acid concentrations were higher in african americans whereas shortchain fatty acids were higher in native africansconclusion our results support the hypothesis that colon cancer risk is influenced by the balance between microbial production of healthpromoting metabolites such as butyrate and potentially carcinogenic metabolites such as secondary bile acids
