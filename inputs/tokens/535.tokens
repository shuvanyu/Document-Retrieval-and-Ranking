to determine the effects of different diets on the genotoxicity of human faecal water a diet rich in fat meat and sugar but poor in vegetables and free of wholemeal products diet 1 was consumed by seven healthy volunteers over a period of 12 daysone week after the end of this period the volunteers started to consume a diet enriched with vegetables and wholemeal products but poor in fat and meat diet 2 over a second period of 12 daysthe genotoxic effect of faecal waters obtained after both diets was assessed with the single cell gel electrophoresis comet assay using the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line ht29 clone 19a as a targetthe fluorescence and length of the tails of the comet images reflects the degree of dna damage in single cellsthe mean dna damage expressed as the ratio of tail intensity fluorescence in the tail to total intensity of the comet after incubation with faecal water from volunteers consuming diet 1 was about twice as high as for diet 2the susceptibility of the cells incubated with faecal water to dna damage caused by additional hydrogen peroxide treatment showed no significant differences between the two dietsgeneration of oxidized pyrimidine and purine bases revealed no differences after pretreatment with both types of faecal waterthe results indicate that diets high in fat and meat but low in dietary fibre increase the genotoxicity of faecal water to colonic cells and may contribute to an enhanced risk of colorectal cancer
