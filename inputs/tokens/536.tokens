purpose of review to highlight mechanisms whereby diet affects colonic function and disease patternsrecent findings topical nutrients are preferentially used by the gut mucosa to maintain structure and functionwith the colon topical nutrients are generated by the colonic microbiota to maintain mucosal healthmost importantly short chain fatty acids control proliferation and differentiation thereby reducing colon cancer riskin patients with massive loss of small intestine short chain fatty acid production supports survival by releasing up to 1000 kcal energydayhuman studies show that the microbiota synthesizes a large pool of utilizable folate which may support survival in impoverished populationsunfortunately the microbiota may also elaborate toxic products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulfide by sulfurreducing bacteria in response to a highmeat dietthe employment of culturefree techniques based on 16s regions of dna has revealed that our colons harbor over 800 bacterial species and 7000 different strainsevidence suggests that the diet directly influences the diversity of the microbiota providing the link between diet colonic disease and colon cancerthe microbiota however can determine the efficiency of food absorption and risk of obesitysummary our investigations have focused on a small number of bacterial species characterization of microbiota and its metabolism can be expected to provide the key to colonic health and disease
