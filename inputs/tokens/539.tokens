background to evaluate the influence of increased dietary protein intake on bacterial colonic metabolism in healthy volunteersmethods short chain fatty acids ammonia and volatile organic compounds in faecal samples and phenols in the urine of five volunteers were measured after one week of basal nutrient intake and and after one week of a diet supplemented with a protein rich food fortimel nutricia zoetermeer the netherlandspaired t tests and factor analysis were used for statistical analysisresults total energy and resistant carbohydrate intake remained unchanged in each study periodthe percentage energy intake delivered as dietary protein increased significantly from 154 to 238 p  0007 during supplement intakea significant increase in faecal ammonia p  0002 faecal valeric acid p  002 and urinary pcresol p  004 was noted during supplementary protein intakea total of 120 different volatile compounds were isolated from the faecal samples of which 10 increased significantly during dietary protein supplementationthe change in volatile pattern especially for s containing metabolites was clearly shown by a factor analysis model which made a distinction between the two dietary regimens for all volunteersconclusion an increase in dietary protein leads to altered products formation by colonic metabolism mainly reflected by an increase in faecal ammonia faecal volatile s substances and urinary pcresol
