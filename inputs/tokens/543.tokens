objective several studies report that diabetes increases risk of cognitive impairment some have hypothesized that advanced glycation end products ages underlie this associationages are crosslinked products that result from reactions between glucose and proteinslittle is known about the association between peripheral age concentration and cognitive agingmethods we prospectively studied 920 elders without dementia 495 with diabetes and 425 with normal glucose mean age 740 yearsusing mixed models we examined baseline age concentration measured with urine pentosidine and analyzed as tertile and performance on the modified minimental state examination 3ms and digit symbol substitution test dsst at baseline and repeatedly over 9 yearsincident cognitive impairment a decline of 10 sd on each test was analyzed with logistic regressionresults older adults with high pentosidine level had worse baseline dsst score p005 but not different 3ms score p032on both tests there was a more pronounced 9year decline in those with high and mid pentosidine level compared to those in the lowest tertile 3ms 70 54 and 25 point decline p overall 0001 dsst 59 74 and 45 point decline p003incident cognitive impairment was higher in those with high or mid pentosidine level than those in the lowest tertile 3ms 24 vs 17 odds ratio155 95 confidence interval 107226 dsst 31 vs 22 odds ratio162 95 confidence interval 113233there was no interaction between pentosidine level diabetes status and cognitive declinemultivariate adjustment for age sex race education hypertension cardiovascular disease estimated glomerular filtration rate and diabetes diminished results somewhat but overall patterns remained similarconclusion high peripheral age level is associated with greater cognitive decline in older adults with and without diabetes
