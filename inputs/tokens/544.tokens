sirtuins sirts a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide naddependent deacetylases are emerging as key molecules that regulate aging and agerelated diseases including cancers metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseasesseven isoforms of sirt sirt17 have been identified in mammalssirt1 and 6 mainly localized in the nucleus regulate transcription of genes and dna repairsirt3 in the mitochondria regulates mitochondrial bioenergeticsinitial studies in yeasts nematodes and flies indicated a strong connection of sirt with the lifeprolonging effects of calorie restriction cr a robust experimental intervention for longevity in a range of organismshowever subsequent studies reported controversial findings regarding sirt roles in the effect of crthis review describes the functional roles of mammalian sirts and discusses their relevance to mechanisms underlying the longevity effect of cr
