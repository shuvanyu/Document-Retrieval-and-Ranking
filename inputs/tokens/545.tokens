advanced glycation end products ages are a heterogeneous complex group of compounds that are formed when reducing sugar reacts in a nonenzymatic way with amino acids in proteins and other macromoleculesthis occurs both exogenously in food and endogenously in humans with greater concentrations found in older adultswhile higher ages occur in both healthy older adults and those with chronic diseases research is progressing to both quantify ages in food and in people and to identify mechanisms that would explain why some human tissues are damaged and others are notin the last twenty years there has been increased evidence that ages could be implicated in the development of chronic degenerative diseases of aging such as cardiovascular disease alzheimers disease and with complications of diabetes mellitusresults of several studies in animal models and humans show that the restriction of dietary ages has positive effects on wound healing insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseasesrecently the effect of restriction in ages intake has been reported to increase the lifespan in animal modelsthis paper will summarize the work that has been published for both food ages and in vivo ages and their relation with aging as well as provide suggestions for future research
