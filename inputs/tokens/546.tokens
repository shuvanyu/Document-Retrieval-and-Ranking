silent information regulator two proteins sirtuins or sirts are a group of histone deacetylases whose activities are dependent on and regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadthey suppress genomewide transcription yet upregulate a select set of proteins related to energy metabolism and prosurvival mechanisms and therefore play a key role in the longevity effects elicited by calorie restrictionrecently a neuroprotective effect of sirtuins has been reported for both acute and chronic neurological diseasesthe focus of this review is to summarize the latest progress regarding the protective effects of sirtuins with a focus on sirt1we first introduce the distribution of sirtuins in the brain and how their expression and activity are regulatedwe then highlight their protective effects against common neurological disorders such as cerebral ischemia axonal injury alzheimers disease parkinsons disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosisfinally we analyze the mechanisms underlying sirtuinmediated neuroprotection centering on their nonhistone substrates such as dna repair enzymes protein kinases transcription factors and coactivatorscollectively the information compiled here will serve as a comprehensive reference for the actions of sirtuins in the nervous system to date and will hopefully help to design further experimental research and expand sirtuins as therapeutic targets in the future
