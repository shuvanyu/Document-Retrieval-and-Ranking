agerelated loss of brain tissue has been inferred from crosssectional neuroimaging studies but direct measurements of gray and white matter changes from longitudinal studies are lackingwe quantified longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging mri scans of 92 nondemented older adults age 5985 years at baseline in the baltimore longitudinal study of aging to determine the rates and regional distribution of gray and white matter tissue loss in older adultsusing images from baseline 2 year and 4 year followup we found significant age changes in gray p  0001 and white p  0001 volumes even in a subgroup of 24 very healthy elderlyannual rates of tissue loss were 54  03 24  04 and 31  04 cm3 per year for total brain gray and white volumes respectively and ventricles increased by 14  01 cm3 per year 37 13 24 and 12 cm3 respectively in very healthyfrontal and parietal compared with temporal and occipital lobar regions showed greater declinegray matter loss was most pronounced for orbital and inferior frontal cingulate insular inferior parietal and to a lesser extent mesial temporal regions whereas white matter changes were widespreadin this first study of gray and white matter volume changes we demonstrate significant longitudinal tissue loss for both gray and white matter even in very healthy older adultsthese data provide essential information on the rate and regional pattern of ageassociated changes against which pathology can be evaluated and suggest slower rates of brain atrophy in individuals who remain medically and cognitively healthy
