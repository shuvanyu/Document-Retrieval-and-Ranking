purpose of review sirtuins are a family of enzymes highly conserved in evolution and involved in mechanisms known to promote healthy ageing and longevitythis review aims to discuss recent advances in understanding the role of sirtuins in particular mammalian sirt1 in promoting longevity and its potential molecular basis for neuroprotection against cognitive ageing and alzheimers disease pathologyrecent findings accumulative increase in oxidative stress during ageing has been shown to decrease sirt1 activity in catabolic tissue possibly by direct inactivation by reactive oxygensirt1 overexpression prevents oxidative stressinduced apoptosis and increases resistance to oxidative stress through regulation of the foxo family of forkhead transcription factorsin addition resveratrol strongly stimulates sirt1 deacetylase activity in a dosedependent manner by increasing its binding affinity to both the acetylated substrate and nadrecently sirt1 has been shown to affect amyloid production through its influence over the adam10 geneupregulation of sirt1 can also induce the notch pathway and inhibit mtor signallingsummary recent studies have revealed some of the mechanisms and pathways that are associated with the neuroprotective effects of sirt1
