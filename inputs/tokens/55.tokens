recent evidences have highlighted an influence of micronutrients in the maintenance of telomere length tlin order to explore whether dietrelated telomere shortening had any physiological relevance and was accompanied by significant damage in the genome in the present study tl was assessed by terminal restriction fragment trf analysis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 56 healthy subjects for which detailed information on dietary habits was available and data were compared with the incidence of nucleoplasmic bridges npbs a marker of chromosomal instability related to telomere dysfunction visualised with the cytokinesisblocked micronucleus assayto increase the capability to detect even slight impairment of telomere function the incidence of npbs was also evaluated on cells exposed in vitro to ionising radiationcare was taken to control for potential confounding factors that might influence tl vizage htert genotype and smoking statusdata showed that higher consumption of vegetables was related with significantly higher mean tl p  0013 in particular the analysis of the association between micronutrients and mean tl highlighted a significant role of antioxidant intake especially betacarotene on telomere maintenance p  0004however the dietrelated telomere shortening did not result in associated increased spontaneous or radiationinduced npbsthe distribution of trfs was also analysed and a slight prevalence of radiationinduced npbs p  003 was observed in subjects with higher amount of very short trfs 2 kbthe relative incidence of very short trfs was positively associate with ageing p  0008 but unrelated to vegetables consumption and daily intake of micronutrients suggesting that the degree of telomere erosion related with low dietary intake of antioxidants observed in this study was not so extensive to lead to chromosome instability
