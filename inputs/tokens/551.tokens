background and purpose the purpose of this study is to investigate the longitudinal agerelated changes in human brain volume using stereological methodsmethods sixtysix older participants 34 men 32 women age mean  sd 789  33 years range 7487 years with normal baseline and followup examinations underwent 2 mris magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on average 44 years apartthe volumes of the cerebrum defined as cortex basal ganglia thalamus and white matter lateral ventricles and cerebellum were estimated on the 2 mris using an unbiased stereological method cavalieri principleresults the annual decrease mean  sd of the cerebral volume was 21  16 p  001the average volume of the lateral ventricles on the second mri was increased by 56  36 per year p  001the average volume of the cerebellum on the second mri was decreased by 12  22 per year p  001even though the average cerebral volume was significantly different between men and women on initial mri and second mri the percentage change of the agerelated cerebral volume decrease in male and female brains between initial mri and second mri were identicalconclusions the findings showed that there was agerelated atrophy of cerebrum and cerebellum and agerelated disproportional enlargement of lateral ventricles in normal older men and women
