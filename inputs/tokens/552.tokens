aging and metabolismrelated disorders are risk factors for alzheimer disease adsince sirtuins may increase the lifespan through regulation of cellular metabolism we compared the concentration of sirtuin 1 sirt1 in the brains of ad patients n  19 and controls n  22 using western immunoblots and in situ hybridizationwe report a significant reduction of sirt1 mrna 29 protein 45 in the parietal cortex of ad patients but not in the cerebellumfurther analyses in a second cohort of 36 subjects confirmed that cortical sirt1 was decreased in the cortex of ad patients but not in individuals with mild cognitive impairmentsirt1 mrna and its translated protein correlated negatively with the duration of symptoms mrna r2  0367 protein r2  0326 and the accumulation of paired helical filament tau mrna r2  0230 protein r2  0119 but weakly with insoluble amyloidβaβ42 mrna r2  0090 protein r2  0072a significant relationship between sirt1 levels and global cognition scores proximate to death was also found r2  009 p  0049in contrast cortical sirt1 levels remained unchanged in a tripletransgenic animal model of adcollectively our results indicate that loss of sirt1 is closely associated with the accumulation of aβ and tau in the cerebral cortex of patients with ad
