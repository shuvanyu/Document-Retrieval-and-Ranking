most ethnic foods and cooking practices have incorporated the use of spices and other food additivesmany common spices have crossed cultural boundaries and appear in multiple ethnic cuisinesrecent studies have demonstrated that many of these ingredients possess antimicrobial properties against common food spoilage microorganismswe developed a laboratory exercise that promotes the use of scientific methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of salsa components at inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganismstomato onion garlic cilantro and jalapeño were tested for antimicrobial properties against a representative fungus saccharomyces cerevisiae and the common food spoilage bacteria staphylococcus aureus bacillus cereus and escherichia colieach component was ethanol extracted and a modification of the kirbybauer method of antimicrobial sensitivity was employedgarlic demonstrated the greatest inhibitory effects against all organisms testedonion demonstrated a slight inhibition of all four organisms while cilantro showed some inhibition of all three bacteria but no effect against the fungusjalapeño may have slightly inhibited e coli and s aureus as evidenced by a consistently measured increase in the zone of inhibition that was not statistically significant when compared to that of the controlfollowing the initial exercise students were given the opportunity to repeat the exercise using other spices such as cinnamon clove nutmeg and corianderstudent learning outcomes were evaluated using preliminary and secondary surveys mainly focusing on definitions of science and hypothesis as well as the process of sciencestudents enjoyed this exercise and met the learning goals of understanding the process and methodology of science as well as the interdisciplinarity inherent in the sciencesstudent learning was evidenced by an increase in the number of correct responses on the secondary survey in comparison to the preliminary
