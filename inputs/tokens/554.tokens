we explored genetic influences on the perception of taste and smell stimuliadult twins rated the chemosensory aspects of water sucrose sodium chloride citric acid ethanol quinine hydrochloride phenylthiocarbamide ptc potassium chloride calcium chloride cinnamon androstenone galaxolide cilantro and basilfor most traits individual differences were stable over time and some traits were heritable h2 from 041 to 071subjects were genotyped for 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms within and near genes related to taste and smellthe results of these association analyses confirmed previous genotypephenotype results for ptc quinine and androstenonenew associations were detected for ratings of basil and a bitter taste receptor gene tas2r60 and between cilantro and variants in three genes trpa1 gnat3 and tas2r50the flavor of ethanol was related to variation within an olfactory receptor gene or7d4 and a gene encoding a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel scnn1dour study demonstrates that persontoperson differences in the taste and smell perception of simple foods and drinks are partially accounted for by genetic variation within chemosensory pathways
