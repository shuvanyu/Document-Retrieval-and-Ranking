purpose this study investigated the effect of a lowfat plantbased diet on body weight metabolism and insulin sensitivity while controlling for exercise in freeliving individualssubjects and methods in an outpatient setting 64 overweight postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to a lowfat vegan diet or a control diet based on national cholesterol education program guidelines without energy intake limits and were asked to maintain exercise unchangeddietary intake body weight and composition resting metabolic rate thermic effect of food and insulin sensitivity were measured at baseline and 14 weeksresults mean  standard deviation interventiongroup body weight decreased 58  32 kg compared with 38  28 kg in the control group p  012in a regression model of predictors of weight change including diet group and changes in energy intake thermic effect of food resting metabolic rate and reported energy expenditure significant effects were found for diet group p  05 thermic effect of food p  05 and resting metabolic rate p  001an index of insulin sensitivity increased from 46  29 to 57  39 p  017 in the intervention group but the difference between groups was not significant p  17conclusion adoption of a lowfat vegan diet was associated with significant weight loss in overweight postmenopausal women despite the absence of prescribed limits on portion size or energy intake
