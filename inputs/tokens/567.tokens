obesity and type 2 diabetes have been associated with a highfat diet hfd and reduced mitochondrial mass and functionwe hypothesized a hfd may affect expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesisto test this hypothesis we fed 10 insulinsensitive males an isoenergetic hfd for 3 days with muscle biopsies before and after interventionoligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed 297 genes were differentially regulated by the hfd bonferonni adjusted p  0001six genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation oxphos decreasedfour were members of mitochondrial complex i ndufb3 ndufb5 ndufs1 and ndufv1 one was sdhb in complex ii and a mitochondrial carrier protein slc25a12peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator1 pgc1 alpha and pgc1beta mrna were decreased by 20 p  001 and 25 p  001 respectivelyin a separate experiment we fed c57bl6j mice a hfd for 3 weeks and found that the same oxphos and pgc1 mrnas were downregulated by approximately 90 cytochrome c and pgc1alpha protein by approximately 40combined these results suggest a mechanism whereby hfd downregulates genes necessary for oxphos and mitochondrial biogenesisthese changes mimic those observed in diabetes and insulin resistance and if sustained may result in mitochondrial dysfunction in the prediabeticinsulinresistant state
