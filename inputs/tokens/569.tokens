insulin resistance is a complex metabolic disorder that defies a single etiological pathwayaccumulation of ectopic lipid metabolites activation of the unfolded protein response upr pathway and innate immune pathways have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistancehowever these pathways are also closely linked to changes in fatty acid uptake lipogenesis and energy expenditure that can impact ectopic lipid depositionultimately accumulation of specific lipid metabolites diacylglycerols andor ceramides in liver and skeletal muscle may be a common pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance
