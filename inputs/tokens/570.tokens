insulin resistance condition is associated to the development of several syndromes such as obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndromealthough the factors linking insulin resistance to these syndromes are not precisely defined yet evidence suggests that the elevated plasma free fatty acid ffa level plays an important role in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistanceaccordantly in vivo and in vitro exposure of skeletal muscle and myocytes to physiological concentrations of saturated fatty acids is associated with insulin resistance conditionseveral mechanisms have been postulated to account for fatty acidsinduced muscle insulin resistance including randle cycle oxidative stress inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctionhere we reviewed experimental evidence supporting the involvement of each of these propositions in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance induced by saturated fatty acids and propose an integrative model placing mitochondrial dysfunction as an important and common factor to the other mechanisms
