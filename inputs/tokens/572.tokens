insulin resistance is a pathophysiological link of obesity to type 2 diabetesthe initial cause of insulin resistance is critical for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabeteslipotoxicity is a wellknown concept in the explanation of initiation of insulin resistancealthough there are several prevailing hypotheses about the cellularmolecular mechanisms of lipotoxicity such as inflammation oxidative stress hyperinsulinemia and er stress the relative importance of these hypothesized events remains to be determinedthe role of hyperinsulinemia is relatively under documented in the literature for the initiation of insulin resistancein this review an interaction of fatty acid and betacells and a synergy between free fatty acids ffas and insulin are emphasized for the role of hyperinsulinemiathis article presents the evidence about ffainduced insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo recent advances in the molecular mechanism of ffa action in betacells a role of gpr40 in the development of insulin resistance and the negative feedback loop of the insulin receptor signal pathwaythe negative feedback loop is discussed in detail with a focus on irs1 serine kinasesthis article provides a substantial support for the role of insulin in the early stages of ffaassociated insulin resistancethe hypothesis of insulins role in lipotoxicity is referred to as the insulin hypothesis in this reviewaccording to this hypothesis prevention of increased betacell response to glucose may be a potential approach for early intervention of metabolic syndrome
