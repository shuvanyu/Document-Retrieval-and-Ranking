objective to evaluate whether plasma levels of free fatty acids ffas are independently associated with incidence of type 2 diabetesresearch design and methods a casecohort design was used to randomly select 580 incident cases of diabetes and 566 noncases from 10275 africanamerican and white men and women in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study aged 4564 years and without prevalent diabetes at the baseline examincident diabetes was ascertained at three exams over 9 years of followupffa levels were measured in plasma samples collected at the baseline examresults at baseline ffa level was inversely associated with height and positively associated with female sex bmi waist circumference waisttohip ratio heart rate plasma triglycerides and an inflammation score quantifying levels of six systemic inflammation markersrelative risks for incident diabetes fourth vs first quartile of ffas were increased in a basic model adjusted for age sex race and center hazard ratio 168 95 ci 120234 and in a model further adjusted for baseline fasting glucose insulin bmi waist circumference triglycerides and the inflammation score 163 104257relative risks associated with a greater ffa level were lowest among those of normal weight and highest among the obese but a formal test of interaction between ffas and bmi was not statistically significantconclusions individuals with higher fasting levels of plasma ffas were at modestly higher risk of type 2 diabetes in this cohort of middleaged adults
