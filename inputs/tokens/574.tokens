an increased intramyocellular lipid imcl content as quantified by 1hmagnetic resonance spectroscopy 1hmrs is associated with reduced insulin sensitivityat present it is unclear which factors determine imcl formation and how rapidly imcl accumulation can be inducedwe therefore studied the impact of hyperinsulinemia and elevated circulating nonesterified fatty acid nefa levels on imcl formation and insulin sensitivitywe further evaluated the influence of a highfat diet on imcl storagein the infusion protocol 12 healthy male subjects underwent a 6h hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic glucose clamp with concomitant infusion of intralipid plus heparinimcl was quantified by 1hmrs in soleus sol and tibialis anterior ta muscle at baseline and then every hourimcl levels started to increase significantly after 2 h reaching a maximum of 1208  34 sol and 1642  138 ta of baseline after 6 h both p  005in parallel the glucose infusion rate gir decreased progressively reaching a minimum of 604  54 of baseline after 6 h over time the gir was strongly correlated with imcl in ta r  098 p  or  0003 and sol muscle r  097 p  or  0005in the diet protocol 12 male subjects ingested both a highfat and lowfat diet for 3 days eachbefore and after completion of each diet imcl levels and insulin sensitivity were assessedafter the highfat diet imcl levels increased significantly in ta muscle to 1480  169 of baseline p  0005 but not in sol muscle to 1144  82 of baseline nsinsulin sensitivity decreased to 833  56 of baseline p  0033there were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or imcl levels after the lowfat dietthe effects of the highfat diet showed greater interindividual variation than those of the infusion protocolthe data from the lipid infusion protocol suggest a functional relationship between imcl levels and insulin sensitivitysimilar effects could be induced by a highfat diet thereby underlining the physiological relevance of these observations
