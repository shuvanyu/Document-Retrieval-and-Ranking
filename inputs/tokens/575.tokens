rat muscle studies suggest competition between free fatty acids ffa and glucose for oxidation resulting in glucose6phosphate accumulationhowever ffa decrease glucose6phosphate in human skeletal muscle indicating direct inhibition of glucose transportphosphorylationthis mechanism could redirect glucose from muscle to brain during fasting and explain the insulin resistance associated with highlipid diets and obesity
