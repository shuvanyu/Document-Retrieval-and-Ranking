recent muscle biopsy studies have shown a relation between intramuscular lipid content and insulin resistancethe aim of this study was to test this relation in humans by using a novel proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr spectroscopy technique which enables noninvasive and rapid approximately 45 min determination of intramyocellular lipid imcl contentnormal weight nondiabetic adults n  23 age 292 yearsbmi  24105 kgm2 were studied using crosssectional analysisinsulin sensitivity was assessed by a 2h hyperinsulinaemic approximately 450 pmolleuglycaemic approximately 5 mmoll clamp testintramyocellular lipid concentrations were determined by using localized 1h nmr spectroscopy of soleus musclesimple linear regression analysis showed an inverse correlation r  0579 p  00037 corrected between intramyocellular lipid content and mvalue 100120 min of clamp as well as between fasting plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentration and mvalue r  054 p  00267intramyocellular lipid content was not related to bmi age and fasting plasma concentrations of triglycerides nonesterified fatty acids glucose or insulinthese results show that intramyocellular lipid concentration as assessed non invasively by localized 1h nmr spectroscopy is a good indicator of whole body insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic nonobese humans
