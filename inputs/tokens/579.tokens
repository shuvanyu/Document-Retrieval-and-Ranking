obesity is commonly associated with elevated plasma free fatty acid ffa levels as well as with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia two important cardiovascular risk factorswhat causes insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in obesity remains uncertainhere we have tested the hypothesis that ffas are the link between obesity and insulin resistancehyperinsulinemia and that therefore lowering of chronically elevated plasma ffa levels would improve insulin resistancehyperinsulinemia and glucose tolerance in obese nondiabetic and diabetic subjectsacipimox 250 mg a longacting antilipolytic drug or placebo was given overnight at 700 pm 100 am 700 am to 9 lean control subjects 13 obese nondiabetic subjects 10 obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and 11 patients with type 2 diabeteseuglycemichyperinsulinemic clamps and oral glucose tolerance tests 75 g were performed on separate mornings after overnight acipimox or placebo treatmentin the three obese study groups acipimox lowered fasting levels of plasma ffas by 6070 and plasma insulin by approximately 50insulinstimulated glucose uptake during euglycemichyperinsulinemic clamping was more than twofold higher after acipimox than after placeboareas under the glucose and insulin curves during oral glucose tolerance testing were both approximately 30 lower after acipimox administration than after placebowe conclude that lowering of elevated plasma ffa levels can reduce insulin resistancehyperinsulinemia and improve oral glucose tolerance in lean and obese nondiabetic subjects and in obese patients with type 2 diabetes
