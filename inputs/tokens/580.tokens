the initial effects of free fatty acids ffas on glucose transportphosphorylation were studied in seven healthy men in the presence of elevated 144  016 mmoll basal 035  006 mmoll and low 001 mmoll control plasma ffa concentrations p  005 between all groups during euglycemichyperinsulinemic clampsconcentrations of glucose6phosphate g6p inorganic phosphate pi phosphocreatine adp and ph in calf muscle were measured every 32 min for 180 min by using 31p nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyrates of wholebody glucose uptake increased similarly until 140 min but thereafter declined by approximately 20 in the presence of basal and high ffas 428  36 and 416  33 vs control 527  33 micromol x kg1 x min1 p  005the rise of intramuscular g6p concentrations was already blunted at 45 min of high ffa exposure 184  17 vs control 238  17 micromoll p  0008at 180 min g6p was lower in the presence of both high and basal ffas 197  21 and 213  18 vs control 286  19 micromoll p  005intramuscular ph decreased by 0013  0001 p  0005 during control but increased by 0008  0002 p  005 during high ffa exposure while pi rose by approximately 039 mmoll p  0005 within 70 min and then slowly decreased in all studiesin conclusion the lack of an initial peak and the early decline of muscle g6p concentrations suggest that even at physiological concentrations ffas primarily inhibit glucose transportphosphorylation preceding the reduction of wholebody glucose disposal by up to 120 min in humans
