to examine the mechanism by which lipids cause insulin resistance in humans skeletal muscle glycogen and glucose6phosphate concentrations were measured every 15 min by simultaneous 13c and 31p nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in nine healthy subjects in the presence of low 018  002 mm mean  sem control or high 193  004 mm lipid infusion plasma free fatty acid levels under euglycemic approximately 52 mm hyperinsulinemic approximately 400 pm clamp conditions for 6 h during the initial 35 h of the clamp the rate of wholebody glucose uptake was not affected by lipid infusion but it then decreased continuously to be approximately 46 of control values after 6 h p  000001augmented lipid oxidation was accompanied by a approximately 40 reduction of oxidative glucose metabolism starting during the third hour of lipid infusion p  005rates of muscle glycogen synthesis were similar during the first 3 h of lipid and control infusion but thereafter decreased to approximately 50 of control values 40  10 vs 93  16 mumolkgmin p  005reduction of muscle glycogen synthesis by elevated plasma free fatty acids was preceded by a fall of muscle glucose6phosphate concentrations starting at approximately 15 h 195  25 vs control 237  26 mm p  001therefore in contrast to the originally postulated mechanism in which free fatty acids were thought to inhibit insulinstimulated glucose uptake in muscle through initial inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase these results demonstrate that free fatty acids induce insulin resistance in humans by initial inhibition of glucose transportphosphorylation which is then followed by an approximately 50 reduction in both the rate of muscle glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation
