purpose an informed decision to accept a health care intervention requires an understanding of its likely benefitthis study assessed participants estimates of the benefit as well as minimum acceptable benefit of screening for breast and bowel cancer and medication to prevent hip fracture and cardiovascular diseasemethods three general practitioners sent questionnaires to all registered patients aged 50 to 70 yearspatients agreeing to participate in the study were asked to estimate the number of events fractures or deaths prevented in a group of 5000 patients undergoing each intervention over a period of 10 years and to indicate the minimum number of events avoided by the intervention that they considered justified its usethe proportions of participants that overestimated each interventions benefit were calculated and univariate and multivariable analyses of predictors of response were performedresults the participation rate was 36 977 patients were invited to participate in the study and 354 returned a completed questionnaireparticipants overestimated the degree of benefit conferred by all interventions 90 of participants overestimated the effect of breast cancer screening 94 overestimated the effect of bowel cancer screening 82 overestimated the effect of hip fracture preventive medication and 69 overestimated the effect of preventive medication for cardiovascular diseaseestimates of minimum acceptable benefit were more conservative but other than for cardiovascular disease mortality prevention most respondents indicated a minimum benefit greater than these interventions achievea lower level of education was associated with higher estimates of minimum acceptable benefit for all interventionsconclusion patients overestimated the risk reduction achieved with 4 examples of screening and preventive medicationsa lower level of education was associated with higher minimum benefit to justify intervention usethis tendency to overestimate benefits may affect patients decisions to use such interventions and practitioners should be aware of this tendency when discussing these interventions with patients
