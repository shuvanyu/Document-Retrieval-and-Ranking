aims to discover whether patients have the same expectations of benefit from taking the first and any additional drugs for the treatment of hypertension and to investigate any patient characteristics which predict willingness to take treatmentmethods this was an anonymous questionnaire survey carried out in a single primary care groupa random sample of patients from the practice list stratified by age and gender were surveyed to determine what benefit they required before deciding to receive first and subsequent drugs to treat hypertensionthey were asked to indicate the largest number needing treatment for 5 years nnt5 to prevent myocardial infarction in 1 smallest benefit that would persuade them of the need for treatmentdemographic information which might explain variability in enthusiasm for treatment was also collectedresults participants required far higher benefit to consider drug treatment than expected with a mean nnt5 for the first treatment of 150 95 ci 123 178marginal benefit demanded for the addition of second and third treatments was at least as great with an nnt5 of 132 95 ci 108 157 and nnt5 of 110 95 ci 86 134additional factors influencing willingness to take treatment were gender with a difference in nnt5 between men and women of 71 95 ci 17 125 difficulty in making the decision very easy vs very difficult of 149 95 ci 60 238 and years in full time education 20 95 ci 09 30 for each additional year of educationany slope of nnt5 with increasing number of tablets disappeared when gender years in education and difficulty in reaching a decision were taken into account simultaneouslyconclusions people may have greater expectation of benefit from antihypertensive drug treatment than it providesthey certainly do not view the addition of subsequent drugs as any lesser step than starting the first in terms of the benefit expectedfull understanding of both the risks and benefits may be of critical importance with those spending longer in full time education and those expending more effort in making the decision accepting more treatmentthe discrepancy between benefit expected and that available demands further research into methods of determining patients expectations and informing individual patient decisions
