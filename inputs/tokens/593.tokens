purpose plantbased nutrition achieved coronary artery disease cad arrest and reversal in a small studyhowever there was skepticism that this approach could succeed in a larger group of patientsthe purpose of our followup study was to define the degree of adherence and outcomes of 198 consecutive patient volunteers who received counseling to convert from a usual diet to plantbased nutritionmethods we followed 198 consecutive patients counseled in plantbased nutritionthese patients with established cardiovascular disease cvd were interested in transitioning to plantbased nutrition as an adjunct to usual cardiovascular carewe considered participants adherent if they eliminated dairy fish and meat and added oilresults of the 198 patients with cvd 177 89 were adherentmajor cardiac events judged to be recurrent disease totaled one stroke in the adherent cardiovascular participantsa recurrent event rate of 6 significantly less than reported by other studies of plantbased nutrition therapythirteen of 21 62 nonadherent participants experienced adverse eventsconclusion most of the volunteer patients with cvd responded to intensive counseling and those who sustained plantbased nutrition for a mean of 37 years experienced a low rate of subsequent cardiac eventsthis dietary approach to treatment deserves a wider test to see if adherence can be sustained in broader populationsplantbased nutrition has the potential for a large effect on the cvd epidemic
