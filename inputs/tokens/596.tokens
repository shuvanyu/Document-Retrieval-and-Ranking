background the benefits of reducing blood pressure are well established but there remains uncertainty about whether the magnitude of the effect varies with the initial blood pressure levelthe objective was to compare the risk reductions achieved by different blood pressurelowering regimens among individuals with different baseline blood pressuresmethods thirtytwo randomized controlled trials were included and seven comparisons between different types of treatments were madefor each comparison the primary prespecified analysis included calculation of summary estimates of effect using randomeffects metaanalysis for major cardiovascular events in four groups defined by baseline sbp 140 140159 160179 and  180 mmhgresults there were 201 566 participants among whom 20 079 primary outcome events were observedthere was no evidence of differences in the proportionate risk reductions achieved with different blood pressurelowering regimens across groups defined according to higher or lower levels of baseline sbp all p for trend  017this finding was broadly consistent for comparisons of different regimens for dbp categories and for commonly used blood pressure cutpointsconclusion it appears unlikely that the effectiveness of blood pressurelowering treatments depends substantively upon starting blood pressure levelas the majority of patients in the trials contributing to these overviews had a history of hypertension or were receiving background blood pressurelowering therapy the findings suggest that additional blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients meeting initial blood pressure targets will produce further benefitsmore broadly the data are supportive of the utilization of blood pressurelowering regimens in highrisk patients with and without hypertension
