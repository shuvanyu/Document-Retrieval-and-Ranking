flaxseed contains ω3 fatty acids lignans and fiber that together may provide benefits to patients with cardiovascular diseaseanimal work identified that patients with peripheral artery disease may particularly benefit from dietary supplementation with flaxseedhypertension is commonly associated with peripheral artery diseasethe purpose of the study was to examine the effects of daily ingestion of flaxseed on systolic sbp and diastolic blood pressure dbp in peripheral artery disease patientsin this prospective doubleblinded placebocontrolled randomized trial patients 110 in total ingested a variety of foods that contained 30 g of milled flaxseed or placebo each day over 6 monthsplasma levels of the ω3 fatty acid αlinolenic acid and enterolignans increased 2 to 50fold in the flaxseedfed group but did not increase significantly in the placebo grouppatient body weights were not significantly different between the 2 groups at any timesbp was  10 mm hg lower and dbp was  7 mm hg lower in the flaxseed group compared with placebo after 6 monthspatients who entered the trial with a sbp  140 mm hg at baseline obtained a significant reduction of 15 mm hg in sbp and 7 mm hg in dbp from flaxseed ingestionthe antihypertensive effect was achieved selectively in hypertensive patientscirculating αlinolenic acid levels correlated with sbp and dbp and lignan levels correlated with changes in dbpin summary flaxseed induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects achieved by a dietary intervention
