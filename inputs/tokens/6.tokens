elevated phosphate p levels are seen in advanced renal failure and together with dysregulated calcium parathyroid hormone and vitamin d levels contribute to the complex of chronic kidney diseasemineral and bone disease ckdmbdconverging evidence from in vitro clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that increased p is associated with vascular calcification and mortalitywhen vessels are exposed to high p conditions in vitro they develop apoptosis convert to bonelike cells and develop extensive calcificationclinical studies in children on dialysis show that high p is associated with increased vessel wall thickness arterial stiffness and coronary calcificationepidemiological studies in adult dialysis patients demonstrate a significant and independent association between raised p and mortalityimportantly raised p is associated with cardiovascular changes even in predialysis ckd and also in subjects with normal renal function but high p all p binders can effectively reduce serum p and this decrease is linked to improved survivalraised serum p triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23 fgf23 which has the beneficial effect of increasing p excretion in early ckd but is increased several 1000fold in dialysis and may be an independent cardiovascular risk factorboth fgf23 and its coreceptor klotho may have direct effects on the vasculature leading to calcificationfascinatingly disturbances in fgf23klotho and raised p have also been associated with premature agingthese data suggest that high p levels have adverse vascular effects and that maintaining the serum p levels in the normal range reduces cardiovascular risk and mortality
