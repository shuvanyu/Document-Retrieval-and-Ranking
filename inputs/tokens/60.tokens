objectives to determine the counseling practices of a group of internists in the areas of smoking exercise and alcohol and seat belt use and to determine the associations among physicians personal health habits and their counseling practicesdesign a random stratified sample of members and fellows of the american college of physicians in 21 regions selected to represent all areas of the united statesbecause of the relatively small proportion of women in this group they were oversampledsetting physicians practicesparticipants one thousand three hundred and fortynine internists members or fellows of the college returned questionnaires for a response rate of 75 52 defined themselves as general internistsinterventions a questionnaire was used to obtain information on internists use of cigarettes alcohol and seat belts and their level of physical activitydata were obtained on the indications used for counseling and the aggressiveness of counseling about each of these four habitsmeasurements and main results bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the tendencies of internist subgroups both in using various indications for counseling and in the thoroughness of counselinggeneralists were more likely than specialists to counsel at least once all patients who were at risk and to be more aggressive in counselingninety percent of respondents counseled all of their patients who smoked but 645 never discussed the use of seat beltsonly 38 of these internists currently smoked cigarettes 113 drank alcohol daily 387 were extremely or quite active and 873 used seat belts all or most of the timeamong men internists for every habit except alcohol use personal health practices were substantially associated with counseling patients for example nonsmoking internists were more likely to counsel smokers and very physically active internists were more likely to counsel about exerciseamong women internists being very physically active was associated with counseling more patients about exercise and alcohol useconclusions the low level of selfreported counseling among these internists suggests that further emphasis on training in these skills is neededthe association between personal and professional practices suggests that medical schools and housestaff training programs should support health promotion activities for future internists
