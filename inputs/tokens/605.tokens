background many biological behavioral social and environmental factors may contribute to the delay or prevention of cognitive declinepurpose to summarize evidence about putative risk and protective factors for cognitive decline in older adults and the effects of interventions for preserving cognitiondata sources englishlanguage publications in medline hugepedia alzgene and the cochrane database of systematic reviews from 1984 through 27 october 2009study selection observational studies with 300 or more participants and randomized controlled trials rcts with 50 or more adult participants who were 50 years or older drawn from general populations and followed for at least 1 year were includedrelevant goodquality systematic reviews were also eligibledata extraction information on study design outcomes and quality were extracted by one researcher and verified by anotheran overall rating of the quality of evidence was assigned by using the grade grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation criteriadata synthesis 127 observational studies 22 rcts and 16 systematic reviews were reviewed in the areas of nutritional factors medical factors and medications social economic or behavioral factors toxic environmental exposures and geneticsfew of the factors had sufficient evidence to support an association with cognitive declineon the basis of observational studies evidence that supported the benefits of selected nutritional factors or cognitive physical or other leisure activities was limitedcurrent tobacco use the apolipoprotein e epsilon4 genotype and certain medical conditions were associated with increased riskone rct found a small sustained benefit from cognitive training high quality of evidence and a small rct reported that physical exercise helps to maintain cognitive functionlimitations the categorization and definition of exposures were heterogeneousfew studies were designed a priori to assess associations between specific exposures and cognitive declinethe review included only englishlanguage studies prioritized categorical outcomes and excluded small studiesconclusion few potentially beneficial factors were identified from the evidence on risk or protective factors associated with cognitive decline but the overall quality of the evidence was lowprimary funding source agency for healthcare research and quality and the national institute on aging through the office of medical applications of research national institutes of health
