eight young men group a underwent 5 h of quiet sitting preceded by 30 min of recumbency 20 min of standing and 20 s of walking and five other young men group b underwent 70 min of sitting preceded by recumbency only to determine the effects of prolonged sitting and previous posture on hemodynamic responses measured by impedance plethysmographygroup a showed more calf blood pooling and a decrease in thigh blood flow during sitting in comparison with the control group but after 1 h of sitting hemodynamic responses of the two groups were similarsitting for 5 h 1st vs 5th h resulted in an increase in calf venous pooling 17 and a decrease in calf bf 13 a reduction in gravitational pooling in the thigh corresponding to increased pooling in the calf increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressures 6 and 73 mmhg respectively and minor changes in heart rate stroke volume and cardiac outputthe results show that it is necessary to sit for 1 h before hemodynamic responses can be assessed in this position regardless of the posture maintained previouslythe main effect of prolonged sitting is pooling in the calf which is compensated for by an increase in peripheral resistance
