background lifestyle modification ie regular physical activity and diet is effective in preventing the agerelated increase in cardiovascular disease riskspotential therapeutic effects of curcumin diferuloylmethane have been confirmed on various diseases including cancer and alzheimers disease but the effects of curcumin have not been tested on central arterial hemodynamicsthe aim of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that the regular endurance exercise combined with daily curcumin ingestion lowers the agerelated increase in left ventricular lv afterload to a greater extent than monotherapy with either intervention alone in postmenopausal women using a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled parallel mannermethods fortyfive women were randomly assigned to four interventions placebo ingestion n  11 curcumin ingestion n  11 exercise training with placebo ingestion n  11 or exercise training with curcumin ingestion n  12curcumin or placebo pills 150 mgday were administered for 8 weeksaortic blood pressure bp and augmentation index aix an index of lv afterload were evaluated by pulse wave analysis from tonometrically measured radial arterial pressure waveformsresults there were no significant differences in baseline hemodynamic variables among four groupsafter the interventions brachial systolic bp sbp significantly decreased in both exercisetrained groups p  005 for both whereas aortic sbp significantly decreased only in the combinedtreatment eg exercise and curcumin group p  005heart rate hr corrected aortic aix significantly decreases only in the combinedtreatment groupconclusions these findings suggest that regular endurance exercise combined with daily curcumin ingestion may reduce lv afterload to a greater extent than monotherapy with either intervention alone in postmenopausal women
