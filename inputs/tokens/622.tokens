objective sedentariness is associated with weight gain and obesitya treadmill desk is the combination of a standing desk and a treadmill that allow employees to work while walking at low speeddesign and methods the hypothesis was that a 1year intervention with treadmill desks is associated with an increase in employee daily physical activity summation of all activity per minute and a decrease in daily sedentary time zero activityemployees n  36 25 women 11 men with sedentary jobs 87  27 kg bmi 29  7 kgm2  n  10 lean bmi  25 kgm2  n  15 overweight 25  bmi  30 kgm2  n  11 obese bmi  30 kgm2  volunteered to have their traditional desk replaced with a treadmill desk to promote physical activity for 1 yearresults daily physical activity using accelerometers work performance body composition and blood variables were measured at baseline and 6 and 12 months after the treadmill desk interventionsubjects who used the treadmill desk increased daily physical activity from baseline 3353  1802 activity units auday to at 6 months 4460  2376 auday p  0001 and at 12 months 4205  2238 auday p  0001access to the treadmill desks was associated with significant decreases in daily sedentary time zero activity from at baseline 1020  75 minday to at 6 months 929  84 minday p  0001 and at 12 months 978  95 minday p  0001for the whole group weight loss averaged 14  33 kg p  005weight loss for obese subjects was 23  35 kg p  003access to the treadmill desks was associated with increased daily physical activity compared to traditional chairbased desks their deployment was not associated with altered performancefor the 36 participants fat mass did not change significantly however those who lost weight n  22 lost 34  54 kg p  0001 of fat massweight loss was greatest in people with obesityconclusions access to treadmill desks may improve the health of office workers without affecting work performancecopyright  2012 the obesity society
