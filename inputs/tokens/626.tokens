hirsutism in polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos consequent to elevated androgen levels leads to significant cosmetic and psychological problemsrecent research in turkey has shown that spearmint tea has antiandrogenic properties in females with hirsutismno research has yet been undertaken to assess whether a reduction in androgen levels brought about by spearmint tea translates to a clinical improvement in the degree of hirsutismthis study was a two centre 30 day randomized controlled trialforty two volunteers were randomized to take spearmint tea twice a day for a 1 month period and compared with a placebo herbal teaat 0 15 and 30 days of the study serum androgen hormone levels and gonadotrophins were checked the degree of hirsutism was clinically rated using the ferrimangalwey score and a questionnaire the modified dqli  dermatology quality of life index was used to assess improvements in the level of selfreported hirsutismforty one of 42 patients completed the studyfree and total testosterone levels were significantly reduced over the 30 day period in the spearmint tea group p  005lh and fsh also increased p  005patients subjective assessments of their degree of hirsutism scored by the modified dqli were significantly reduced in the spearmint tea group p  005there was however no significant reduction in the objective ferrimangalwey ratings of hirsutism between the two trial groups over the trial duration p  012there was a clear and significant alteration in the relevant hormone levelsthis is associated clinically with a reduction in the selfreported degree of hirsutism but unfortunately not with the objectively rated scoreit was demonstrated and confirmed that spearmint has antiandrogen properties the simple fact that this does not clearly translate into clinical practice is due to the relationship between androgen hormones and follicular hair growth and cell turnover timesimply put the study duration was not long enoughthe original studies from turkey were in fact only 5 days longthe time taken for hirsutism to resolve is significant and a much longer future study is proposed as the preliminary findings are encouraging that spearmint has the potential for use as a helpful and natural treatment for hirsutism in pcosc 2009 john wiley  sons ltd
