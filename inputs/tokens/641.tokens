a number of studies have evaluated the health of vegetariansothers have studied the health effects of foods that are preferred or avoided by vegetariansthe purpose of this review is to look critically at the evidence on the health effects of vegetarian diets and to seek possible explanations where results appear to conflictthere is convincing evidence that vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease largely explained by low ldl cholesterol probable lower rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and lower prevalence of obesityoverall their cancer rates appear to be moderately lower than others living in the same communities and life expectancy appears to be greaterhowever results for specific cancers are much less convincing and require more studythere is evidence that risk of colorectal cancer is lower in vegetarians and in those who eat less meat however results from british vegetarians presently disagree and this needs explanationit is probable that using the label vegetarian as a dietary category is too broad and that our understanding will be served well by dividing vegetarians into more descriptive subtypesalthough vegetarian diets are healthful and are associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases different types of vegetarians may not experience the same effects on health
