background a reduction in dietary saturated fat has generally been thought to improve cardiovascular healthobjective the objective of this metaanalysis was to summarize the evidence related to the association of dietary saturated fat with risk of coronary heart disease chd stroke and cardiovascular disease cvd chd inclusive of stroke in prospective epidemiologic studiesdesign twentyone studies identified by searching medline and embase databases and secondary referencing qualified for inclusion in this studya randomeffects model was used to derive composite relative risk estimates for chd stroke and cvdresults during 523 y of followup of 347747 subjects 11006 developed chd or strokeintake of saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of chd stroke or cvdthe pooled relative risk estimates that compared extreme quantiles of saturated fat intake were 107 95 ci 096 119 p  022 for chd 081 95 ci 062 105 p  011 for stroke and 100 95 ci 089 111 p  095 for cvdconsideration of age sex and study quality did not change the resultsconclusions a metaanalysis of prospective epidemiologic studies showed that there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of chd or cvdmore data are needed to elucidate whether cvd risks are likely to be influenced by the specific nutrients used to replace saturated fat
