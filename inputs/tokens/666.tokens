ciguatera is an important form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of seafoodthe disease is characterised by gastrointestinal neurological and cardiovascular disturbancesin cases of severe toxicity paralysis coma and death may occurthere is no immunity and the toxins are cumulativesymptoms may persist for months or years or recur periodicallythe epidemiology of ciguatera is complex and of central importance to the management and future use of marine resourcesciguatera is an important medical entity in tropical and subtropical pacific and indian ocean regions and in the tropical caribbeanas reef fish are increasingly exported to other areas it has become a world health problemthe disease is underreported and often misdiagnosedlipidsoluble polyether toxins known as ciguatoxins accumulated in the muscles of certain subtropical and tropical marine finfish cause ciguateraciguatoxins arise from biotransformation in the fish of less polar ciguatoxins gambiertoxins produced by gambierdiscus toxicus a marine dinoflagellate that lives on macroalgae usually attached to dead coralthe toxins and their metabolites are concentrated in the food chain when carnivorous fish prey on smaller herbivorous fishhumans are exposed at the end of the food chainmore than 400 species of fish can be vectors of ciguatoxins but generally only a relatively small number of species are regularly incriminated in ciguateraciguateric fish look taste and smell normal and detection of toxins in fish remains a problemmore than 20 precursor gambiertoxins and ciguatoxins have been identified in g toxicus and in herbivorous and carnivorous fishthe toxins become more polar as they undergo oxidative metabolism and pass up the food chainthe main pacific ciguatoxin pctx1 causes ciguatera at levels01 microgkg in the flesh of carnivorous fishthe main caribbean ciguatoxin cctx1 is less polar and 10fold less toxic than pctx1ciguatoxins activate sodium ion na  channels causing cell membrane excitability and instabilityworldwide coral bleaching is now well documented and there is a strong association between global warming and the bleaching and death of coralthis together with natural environmental factors such as earthquakes and hurricanes and manmade factors such as tourism dock construction sewage and eutrophication may create more favourable environments for g toxicuswhile low levels of g toxicus are found throughout tropical and subtropical waters the presence of bloom numbers is unpredictable and patchyonly certain genetic strains produce ciguatoxins and environmental triggers for increasing toxin production are unknown
