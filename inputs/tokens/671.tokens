background epithelial barrier function is impaired in crohns diseaseaim to define the underlying cellular mechanisms with special attention to tight junctionsmethods biopsy specimens from the sigmoid colon of patients with mild to moderately active or inactive crohns disease were studied in ussing chambers and barrier function was determined by impedance analysis and conductance scanningtight junction structure was analysed by freeze fracture electron microscopy and tight junction proteins were investigated immunohistochemically by confocal laser scanning microscopy and quantified in immunoblotsepithelial apoptosis was analysed in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nickend labelling and 46diamidino2phenylindole stainingresults patients with active crohns disease showed an impaired intestinal barrier function as indicated by a distinct reduction in epithelial resistanceas distribution of conductivity was even focal epithelial lesions eg microerosions did not contribute to barrier dysfunctioninstead freeze fracture electron microscopy analysis showed reduced and discontinuous tight junction strandsoccludin and the sealing tight junction proteins claudin 5 and claudin 8 were downregulated and redistributed off the tight junction whereas the poreforming tight junctions protein claudin 2 was strongly upregulated which constitute the molecular basis of tight junction changesother claudins were unchanged claudins 1 4 and 7 or not detectable in sigmoid colon claudins 11 12 14 15 and 16claudin 2 upregulation was less pronounced in active crohns disease compared with active ulcerative colitis and was inducible by tumour necrosis factor Î±as a second source of impaired barrier function epithelial apoptosis was distinctly increased in active crohns disease mean sd 52 05 v 19 02 in controlby contrast barrier function tight junction proteins and apoptosis were unaffected in crohns disease in remissionconclusion upregulation of poreforming claudin 2 and downregulation and redistribution of sealing claudins 5 and 8 lead to altered tight junction structure and pronounced barrier dysfunction already in mild to moderately active crohns disease
