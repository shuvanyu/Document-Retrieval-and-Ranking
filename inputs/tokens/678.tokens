background  aims increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce risk of inflammatory bowel diseases crohns disease cd ulcerative colitis uchowever few prospective studies have examined associations between longterm intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident cd or ucmethods we collected and analyzed data from 170776 women followed over 26 y who participated in the nurses health study followed for 3317425 personydietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 y selfreported cd and uc were confirmed through review of medical recordscox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders were used to calculate hazard ratios hrsresults we confirmed 269 incident cases of cd incidence 8100000 persony and 338 cases of uc incidence 10100000 personycompared to the lowest quintile of energyadjusted cumulative average intake of dietary fiber intake of the highest quintile median of 243 gday was associated with a 40 reduction in risk of cd multivariate hr for cd 059 95 confidence interval ci 039090this apparent reduction appeared to be greatest for fiber derived from fruits fiber from cereals whole grains or legumes did not modify riskin contrast neither total intake of dietary fiber multivariate hr 082 95 ci 058117 nor intake of fiber from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of ucconclusion based on data from the nurses health study longterm intake of dietary fiber particularly from fruit is associated with lower risk of cd but not ucfurther studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this association
