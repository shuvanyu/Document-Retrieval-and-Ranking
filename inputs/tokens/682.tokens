objective to evaluate the possible biochemical effect of diet and heredity on the rates of monozygotic and dizygotic twinningstudy design in that insulinlike growth factor igf has been found to be elevated in cows selected for their demonstrated increased twinning rate the effect of agents that influence the level of igf in women was examinedthis was correlated with their prior history of singleton versus twin birthingin particular the effect of diets consisting of or excluding animal products that have elevated igf content eg milk was consideredresults vegan women who exclude dairy products from their diets have a twinning rate which is onefifth that of vegetarians and omnivoresconclusion the results reported here support the proposed igf model of dizygotic twinninggenotypes favoring elevated igf and diets including dairy products especially in areas where growth hormone is given to cattle appear to enhance the chances of multiple pregnancies due to ovarian stimulation
