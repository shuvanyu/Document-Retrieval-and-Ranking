objective based on the hypothesis that highmeat diets may increase breast cancer risk through hormonal pathways the present analysis compared oestrogens in serum and urine by meateating statusdesign intervention with repeated measuressetting two randomized soya trials bean1 and bean2 among premenopausal healthy womensubjects bean1 participants completed seven unannounced 24 h dietary recalls and donated five blood and urine samples over 2 yearsbean2 women provided seven recalls and three samples over 13 monthsserum samples were analysed for oestrone e₁ and oestradiol e₂ using rianine oestrogen metabolites were measured in urine by lcms semivegetarians included women who reported consuming 30 g of red meat poultry and fish daily and pescatarians those who reported consuming 20 g of meatpoultry but 10 g of fish dailyall other women were classified as nonvegetarianswe applied mixed models to compute leastsquare means by vegetarian status adjusted for potential confoundersresults the mean age of the 272 participants was 419 sd 45 yearsserum e₁ 85 v 100 pgml p  004 and e₂ 140 v 154 pgml p  004 levels were lower in the thirtyseven semivegetarians than in the 235 nonvegetariansthe sum of the nine urinary oestrogen metabolites 183 v 200 pmolmg creatinine p  027 and the proportions of individual oestrogens and pathways did not differ by meateating statusrestricting the models to the samples collected during the luteal phase strengthened the associationsconclusions given the limitations of the study the lower levels of serum oestrogens in semivegetarians than nonvegetarians need confirmation in larger populations
