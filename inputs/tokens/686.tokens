the estrogens estrone e1 17alphaestradiol e2alpha 17betaestradiol e2beta and estriol e3 are natural sex hormones produced by humans and animalsin addition there are some synthetic estrogens such as 17alphaethinylestradiol ee2 used for contraception purposesthese compounds are able to produce endocrine disruption in living organisms at nanogramperliter levelsin both humans and animals estrogens are excreted in urine and feces reaching the natural environment through discharge from sewage treatment plants stp and manure disposal unitsin stps hormone removal depends on the type of treatment process and on different parameters such as the hydraulic and sludge retention timesthus hormone elimination rates vary from 0 to 90 in different stpsanimals are also an important source of estrogens in the environmentindeed animals produce high concentrations of hormones which will end up in manure which is typically spread on landhence wasteborne animal hormones may transfer these pollutants to the soilthe purpose of this review is to highlight the significance for both health and the environment of pollution by estrogens and critically review the existing knowledge on their fate and removal in different treatment processesrelevant information on the microbial degradation of hormones and metabolic pathways is also included
