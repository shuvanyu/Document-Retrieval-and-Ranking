cigarette smoking remains a significant health threat for smokers and nonsmokers alikesecondhand smoke shs is intrinsically more toxic than directly inhaled smokerecently a new threat has been discovered  thirdhand smoke ths  the accumulation of shs on surfaces that ages with time becoming progressively more toxicths is a potential health threat to children spouses of smokers and workers in environments where smoking is or has been allowedthe goal of this study is to investigate the effects of ths on liver lung skin healing and behavior using an animal model exposed to ths under conditions that mimic exposure of humansthsexposed mice show alterations in multiple organ systems and excrete levels of nnal a tobaccospecific carcinogen biomarker similar to those found in children exposed to shs and consequently to thsin liver ths leads to increased lipid levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease a precursor to cirrhosis and cancer and a potential contributor to cardiovascular diseasein lung ths stimulates excess collagen production and high levels of inflammatory cytokines suggesting propensity for fibrosis with implications for inflammationinduced diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthmain wounded skin healing in thsexposed mice has many characteristics of the poor healing of surgical incisions observed in human smokerslastly behavioral tests show that thsexposed mice become hyperactivethe latter data combined with emerging associated behavioral problems in children exposed to shsths suggest that with prolonged exposure they may be at significant risk for developing more severe neurological disordersthese results provide a basis for studies on the toxic effects of ths in humans and inform potential regulatory policies to prevent involuntary exposure to ths
