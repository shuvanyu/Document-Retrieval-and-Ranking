background nitrate and nitrite are present in many foods and are precursors of nnitroso compounds known animal carcinogens and potential human carcinogenswe prospectively investigated the association between nitrate and nitrite intake from dietary sources and risk of renal cell carcinoma rcc overall and clear cell and papillary histological subtypes in the nihaarp diet and health studymethods nitrate and nitrite intakes were estimated from a 124item food frequency questionnaireover a mean followup of 9 years we identified 1816 rcc cases n498 clear cell n115 papillary cell among 491â€‰841 participantscox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratios hrs and 95 confidence intervals cisresults individuals in the highest quintile of nitrite intake from animal sources compared with those in the lowest quintile had an increased risk of total rcc and clear cell subtype hr128 95 ci 110149 and hr168 95 ci 125227 respectivelynitrite from processed meats and other animal sources were associated with increased clear cell adenocarcinoma risk hr133 95 ci 101176 and hr178 95 ci 134236 respectivelywe found no association for nitrite intake from plant sources or nitrate intake overallconclusion our findings suggest that nitrite from animal sources may increase the risk of rcc particularly clear cell adenocarcinomas
