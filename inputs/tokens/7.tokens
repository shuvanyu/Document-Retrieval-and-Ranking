excessive dietary phosphorus may increase cardiovascular risk in healthy individuals as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease but the mechanisms underlying this risk are not completely understoodto determine whether postprandial hyperphosphatemia may promote endothelial dysfunction we investigated the acute effect of phosphorus loading on endothelial function in vitro and in vivoexposing bovine aortic endothelial cells to a phosphorus load increased production of reactive oxygen species which depended on phosphorus influx via sodiumdependent phosphate transporters and decreased nitric oxide production via inhibitory phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthasephosphorus loading inhibited endotheliumdependent vasodilation of rat aortic ringsin 11 healthy men we alternately served meals containing 400 mg or 1200 mg of phosphorus in a doubleblind crossover study and measured flowmediated dilation of the brachial artery before and 2 h after the mealsthe high dietary phosphorus load increased serum phosphorus at 2 h and significantly decreased flowmediated dilationflowmediated dilation correlated inversely with serum phosphorustaken together these findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction mediated by acute postprandial hyperphosphatemia may contribute to the relationship between serum phosphorus level and the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
