background some evidence has suggested that a diet with a higher ratio of protein to carbohydrates has metabolic advantages in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome pcosobjective the objective of this study was to compare the effect of a highprotein hp diet to a standardprotein sp diet in women with pcosdesign a controlled 6mo trial was conducted in 57 pcos womenthe women were assigned through rank minimization to one of the following 2 diets without caloric restriction an hp diet 40 of energy from protein and 30 of energy from fat or an sp diet 15 of energy from protein and 30 of energy from fatthe women received monthly dietary counselingat baseline and 3 and 6 mo anthropometric measurements were performed and blood samples were collectedresults seven women dropped out because of pregnancy 23 women dropped out because of other reasons and 27 women completed the studythe hp diet produced a greater weight loss mean 44 kg 95 ci 03 86 kg and body fat loss mean 43 kg 95 ci 09 76 kg than the sp diet after 6 mowaist circumference was reduced more by the hp diet than by the sp dietthe hp diet produced greater decreases in glucose than did the sp diet which persisted after adjustment for weight changesthere were no differences in testosterone sex hormonebinding globulin and blood lipids between the groups after 6 mohowever adjustment for weight changes led to significantly lower testosterone concentrations in the spdiet group than in the hpdiet groupconclusion replacement of carbohydrates with protein in ad libitum diets improves weight loss and improves glucose metabolism by an effect that seems to be independent of the weight loss and thus seems to offer an improved dietary treatment of pcos women
