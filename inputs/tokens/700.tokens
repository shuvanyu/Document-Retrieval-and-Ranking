to examine extraalimentary effects of highcarbohydrate highfiber hcf diets insulinmediated glucose disposal employing the euglycemic clamp and hepatic glucose output hgo employing 662h2glucose were measured in 12 healthy young and old individuals before and after 2128 d of an hcf dietdiet lowered fasting concentrations of glucose from 53  02 to 51  01 mmoll p less than 001 and insulin from 660  79 to 495  57 pmoll p less than 001fasting serum cholesterol decreased from 517  018 to 380  020 mmoll p less than 001 in young individuals and from 615  052 to 499  049 mmoll p less than 001 in elderly individualsfasting serum triglyceride concentrations basal hgo and insulin suppression of hgo were unchanged by the dietglucose disposal rates increased from 1887  166 before 2387  278 mumolkg1min1 after the diet p less than 002therefore hcf diets may improve carbohydrate economy by enhanced peripheral sensitivity to insulin
