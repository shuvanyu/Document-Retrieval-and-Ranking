the present study was designed to examine the effects of habitual consumption of taiwanese vegetarian diets on hormonal secretion and on lipid and glycaemic controlof the ninetyeight healthy female adults recruited from hualien taiwan aged 3145 years fortynine were buddhist lactovegetarians and fortynine were omnivoresdietary intakes were measured and blood levels of nutrients and hormones were analysedvegetarians consumed less energy fat and protein but more fibre than the omnivorescompared with the omnivores the vegetarians had on average lower bmi and smaller waist circumferenceexcept for slightly lower levels of thyroxine t4 in vegetarians vegetarians and omnivores both showed similar levels of triiodothyronine t3 free t4 thyroidstimulating hormone t3t4 ratio and cortisolcompared with the omnivores the vegetarians had significantly lower levels of fasting insulin median 353 v 506 pmoll and plasma glucose mean 47 se 005 v 49 se 005 mmollinsulin resistance as calculated by the homeostasis model assessment method was significantly lower in the vegetarians than in the omnivores median 110 v 156 while betacell function was not different between the two groupsbmi and diet were both independent predictors for insulin resistance and contributed 18 and 15  of the variation in insulin resistance respectivelyin conclusion taiwanese vegetarians had lower glucose and insulin levels and higher insulin sensitivity than did the omnivoresdiet and lower bmi were partially responsible for the high insulin sensitivity observed in young taiwanese vegetarians
