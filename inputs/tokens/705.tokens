aim to compare the insulin sensitivity indices between chinese vegetarians and omnivoresmethods the study included 36 healthy volunteers vegetarian n19 omnivore n17 who had normal fasting plasma glucose levelseach participant completed an insulin suppression testwe compared steadystate plasma glucose sspg fasting insulin the homeostasis model assessment for insulin sensitivity homair and homa s and betacell function homa beta between the groupswe also tested the correlation of sspg with years on a vegetarian dietresults the omnivore subjects were younger than the vegetarians 55737 vs 58636 year of age p0022there was no difference between the two groups in sex blood pressure renal function tests and lipid profilesthe omnivores had higher serum uric acid levels than vegetarians 525084 vs 454075 mgdl p0011the results of the indices were different between omnivores and vegetarians sspg meansd1054102 vs 803113 mgdl p0001 fasting insulin 406077 vs 302119 microuml p0004 homair 675131 vs 478207 p0002 homa s 1592317 vs 26431717 p0018 except insulin secretion index homa beta 656180 vs 586148 p0208we found a clear linear relation between years on a vegetarian diet and sspg r0541 p0017conclusions the vegetarians were more insulin sensitive than the omnivore counterpartsthe degree of insulin sensitivity appeared to be correlated with years on a vegetarian diet
