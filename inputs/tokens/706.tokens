hyperinsulinemia hypertension hypertriglyceridemia and obesity are independent risk factors for coronary artery disease and are often found in the same personthis study investigated the effects of an intensive 3week dietary and exercise program on these risk factorsthe group was divided into diabetic patients noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus niddm n  13 insulinresistant persons n  29 and those with normal insulin less than or equal to 10 microuml n  30the normal groups had very small but statistically significant decreases in all of the risk factorsthe patients with niddm had the greatest decreasesinsulin was reduced from 40  15 to 27  11 microuml blood pressure from 142  983  3 to 132  671  3 mm hg triglycerides from 353  76 to 196  31 mgdl and body mass index from 311  40 to 297  37 kgm2although there was a significant weight loss for the group with niddm resulting in the decrease in body mass index 8 of 9 patients who were initially overweight were still overweight at the end of the program and 5 of the 8 were still obese body mass index greater than 30 kgm2 indicating that normalization of body weight is not a requisite for a reduction or normalization of other risk factorsinsulin was reduced from 182  18 to 116  12 microuml in the insulinresistant group with 17 of the 29 subjects achieving normal fasting insulin less than 10 microumlabstract truncated at 250 words
