background dietary modification via caloric restriction is associated with multiple effects related to improved metabolic and cardiovascular healthhowever a mandated reduction in kilocalories is not welltolerated by many individuals limiting the longterm application of such a planthe daniel fast is a widely utilized fast based on the biblical book of danielit involves a 21 day ad libitum food intake period devoid of animal products and preservatives and inclusive of fruits vegetables whole grains legumes nuts and seedsthe purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of the daniel fast to improve markers of metabolic and cardiovascular disease riskmethods 43 subjects 13 men 30 women 35  1 yrs range 2062 yrs completed a 21 day period of modified food intake in accordance with detailed guidelines provided by investigatorsall subjects purchased and prepared their own foodfollowing initial screening subjects were given one week to prepare for the fast after which time they reported to the lab for their preintervention assessment day 1after the 21 day fast subjects reported to the lab for their postintervention assessment day 22for both visits subjects reported in a 12 hr fasted state performing no strenuous physical activity during the preceding 2448 hrsat each visit mental and physical health sf12 form resting heart rate and blood pressure and anthropometric variables were measuredblood was collected for determination of complete blood count metabolic panel lipid panel insulin homair and creactive protein crpsubjects selfreported compliance mood and satiety in relation to the fast were also recordeddiet records were maintained by all subjects during the 7 day period immediately prior to the fast usual intake and during the final 7 days of the fastresults subjects compliance to the fast was 987  02 mean  semusing a 10 point scale subjects mood and satiety were both 79  02the following variables were significantly p  005 lower following the fast as compared to before the fast white blood cell count 568  024 vs 499  019 103μl1 blood urea nitrogen 1307  058 vs 1014  059 mgdl1 blood urea nitrogencreatinine 1474  059 vs 1167  068 protein 695  007 vs 677  006 gdl1 total cholesterol 17107  457 vs 13869  439 mgdl1 ldlc 9838  389 vs 7607  353 mgdl1 hdlc 5565  250 vs 4758  219 mgdl1 sbp 11465  234 vs 10593  212 mmhg and dbp 7223  159 vs 6700  143 mmhginsulin 442  052 vs 337  035 μuml1 p  010 homair 097  013 vs072  008 p  010 and crp 315  091 vs 160  042 mgl1 p  013 were lowered to a clinically meaningful albeit statistically insignificant extentno significant difference was noted for any anthropometric variable p  005as expected multiple differences in dietary intake were noted p  005 including a reduction in total kilocalorie intake 2185  94 vs 1722  85conclusion a 21 day period of modified dietary intake in accordance with the daniel fast is 1 welltolerated by men and women and 2 improves several risk factors for metabolic and cardiovascular diseaselarger scale randomized studies inclusive of a longer time period and possibly a slight modification in food choice in an attempt to maintain hdl cholesterol are needed to extend these findings
