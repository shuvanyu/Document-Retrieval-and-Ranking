to study the effect of a moderate increase in insulin secretion produced by an increased daily protein intake on dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas a balanced randomized crossover trial consisting of three strictly controlled dietary regimens was performed in six healthy male volunteersthe basic diet b contained 50 g proteind diets p and m also basic diets were enriched with either 32 g proteind p or 10 mmol lmethionined mmethionine was given as a specific nonprotein source of endogenously derived sulfate to control for possible confounding effects on dheas due to an increased sulfate supplyat the end of each 4day diet period blood and 24hour urine samples were collectedfasting plasma levels of testosterone cortisol insulinlike growth factori igfi and insulin as well as urinary output of total hot acidcleaved testosterone conjugates and 3alphaandrostanediol glucuronide did not show significant changes in response to dietary manipulationsendogenous sulfate availability as reflected by renal sulfate output per 24 hours approximately doubled with diets p and m however plasma levels 63  15 68  18 and 69  21 micromoll for b p and m respectively and urinary excretion 88  98 94  112 80  83 micromold of dheas remained unaffectedconsidering the clear increments p  01 in urinary cpeptide excretion with diet p 204  103 nmold versus diets b and m 126  51 and 132  36 nmold respectively our results suggest that a moderately strong dietinduced increase in daily insulin secretion does not alter urinary and plasma levels of dheas
