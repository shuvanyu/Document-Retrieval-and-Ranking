background tea consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease including strokedirect effects of tea components on the vasculature particularly the endothelium may partly explain this associationobjective we performed a metaanalysis of controlled human intervention studies on the effect of tea on flowmediated dilation fmd of the brachial artery a measurement of endothelial function which is suggested to be associated with cardiovascular riskmethods human intervention studies were identified by systematic search of the databases medline embase chemical s and biosis through march 2009 and by handsearching related articlesstudies were selected based on predefined criteria intervention with tea as the sole experimental variable placebocontrolled design and no missing data on fmd outcome or its variabilitya random effects model was used to calculate the pooled overall effect on fmd due to the intake of teathe impact of various subject and treatment characteristics was investigated in the presence of heterogeneityresults in total 9 studies from different research groups were included with 15 relevant study armsthe overall absolute increase in fmd of tea vs placebo was 26 of the arterial diameter 95 ci 1833 pvalue 0001 for a median daily dose of 500 ml of tea 23 cupsthis is a relative increase of approximately 40 compared to the average fmd of 63 measured under placebo or baseline conditionsthere was significant heterogeneity between studies pvalue 0001 that might partly be explained by the cuff position either distal or proximal to the area of fmd measurementno indication for publication bias was foundconclusion moderate consumption of tea substantially enhances endothelialdependent vasodilationthis may provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced risk of cardiovascular events and stroke observed among tea drinkers
