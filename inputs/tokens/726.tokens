although coffee is a widely used pharmacologically active beverage its impact on the cardiovascular system is controversialto explore the effect of acute caffeine ingestion on brachial artery flowmediated dilation fmd in subjects without coronary artery disease cad controls and patients with cad we prospectively assessed brachial artery fmd in 40 controls and 40 age and gendermatched patients with documented stable cad on 2 separate mornings 1 week to 2 weeks apartafter overnight fasting discontinuation of all medications for 12 hours and absence of caffeine for 48 hours participants received capsules with caffeine 200 mg or placeboone hour after drug ingestion participants underwent brachial artery fmd and nitroglycerinmediated dilation ntg using highresolution ultrasoundas expected patients with cad were more often diabetic hypertensive obese dyslipidemic and smoked more than controls p 001 for all comparisonsaspirin clopidogrel angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors Î² blockers and statins were significantly more common in patients with cad than in controls p 001 for all comparisonsat baseline fmd but not ntg was significantly lower in patients with cad compared to controlsacute caffeine ingestion significantly increased fmd patients with cad 56  50 vs 146  50 controls 84  29 vs 186  68 p 0001 for all comparisons but not ntg patients with cad 130  52 vs 138  61 controls 129  39 vs 139  58 p  ns for all comparisons and significantly decreased highsensitivity creactive protein patients with cad 26  14 vs 14  12 mgl controls 34  30 vs 12  10 mgl p 0001 for all comparisons in the 2 groups compared to placeboin conclusion acute caffeine ingestion significantly improved endothelial function assessed by brachial artery fmd in subjects with and without cad and was associated with lower plasma markers of inflammationcopyright  2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved
