coffee is one of the most widely used pharmacologically active beveragesthe present study was designed to evaluate the acute effect of coffee ingestion on endothelial function in healthy individuals and the potential role of caffeinewe studied 17 healthy young adults 28930 years old nine men who were regular nonheavy coffee drinkersthe endothelial performance was estimated by endotheliumdependent fmd flowmediated dilatation of the brachial artery before and 30 60 90 and 120 min after ingestion of a cup of caffeinated coffee 80 mg of caffeine or the corresponding decaffeinated beverage  2 mg of caffeine in two separate sessions following a randomized singleblind crossover designthere was no difference in baseline fmd values between the two sessions 778 compared with 707 after caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee respectively p  ns not significantcaffeinated coffee led to a decline of fmd 778 286 212 444 and 457 at baseline 30 60 90 and 120 min respectively p  0001this adverse effect was focused at 30 p  0004 and 60 min p  0001no significant effect on fmd was found with the decaffeinated coffee session 707 624 521 741 and 520 p  nsthe composite effect of the type of coffee consumed over time on fmd was significantly different p  0021in conclusion coffee exerts an acute unfavourable effect on the endothelial function in healthy adults lasting for at least 1 h after intakethis effect might be attributed to caffeine given that decaffeinated coffee was not associated with any change in the endothelial performance
