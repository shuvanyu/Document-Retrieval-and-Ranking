background caffeine is one of the most widely consumed pharmacologically active substancesits acute effect on myocardial blood flow is widely unknownour aim was to assess the acute effect of caffeine in a dose corresponding to two cups of coffee on myocardial blood flow mbf in coronary artery disease cadmethodologyprincipal findings mbf was measured with 15olabelled h2o and positron emission tomography pet at rest and after supine bicycle exercise in controls n  15 mean age 5813 years and in cad patients n  15 mean age 619 yearsin the latter regional mbf was assessed in segments subtended by stenotic and remote coronary arteriesall measurements were repeated fifty minutes after oral caffeine ingestion 200 mgmyocardial perfusion reserve mpr was calculated as ratio of mbf during bicycle stress divided by mbf at restresting mbf was not affected by caffeine in both groupsexerciseinduced mbf response decreased significantly after caffeine in controls 226056 vs 202056 p0005 remote 240070 vs 178046 p0001 and in stenotic segments 190041 vs 138030 p0001caffeine decreased mpr significantly by 14 in controls p005 vs baselinein cad patients mpr decreased by 18 p005 vs baseline in remote and by 25 in stenotic segments p001 vs baselineconclusions we conclude that caffeine impairs exerciseinduced hyperaemic mbf response in patients with cad to a greater degree than agematched controls
