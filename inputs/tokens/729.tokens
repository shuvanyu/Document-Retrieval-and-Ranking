backgroundobjectives coffee is known to contain antioxidant substances whose effects may be blunted because of caffeine that may unfavorably affect the cardiovascular systemthis study was designed to investigate the acute dosedependent effects of decaffeinated coffee dc on endothelial function measured by the brachial artery flowmediated dilation fmdsubjectsmethods a total of 15 8 men and 7 women healthy nonobese subjects underwent a singleblind crossover studysubjects ingested one and two cups of decaffeinated italian espresso coffee in random order at 5 to 7day intervalsresults in the hour following the ingestion of two cups of dc fmd increased meansem 0 min 7407 30 min 8006 60 min 10808 p0001 as compared to consumption of one cup of dc 0 min 6907 30 min 8412 60 min 8511 3 x 2 repeatedmeasures analysis of variance p0037 for time x treatment effectblood pressure did not differ between groups and basal heart rate was lower in the twocup group at baseline and 60 minconclusions the present study demonstrated a significant acute favorable dosedependent effect of decaffeinated espresso coffee on endothelial functionfurther studies are needed to investigate the effects of chronic use of dc especially with respect to caffeinated coffee and in subjects with cardiovascular diseases
