although coffee is largely consumed by adults in western countries controversy exists about its impact on the cardiovascular systemwe recently demonstrated that caffeinated and decaffeinated espresso coffee have different acute effects on endothelial function in healthy subjects measured using flowmediated dilation fmd of the brachial arteryin this study we measured the antioxidant capacity of two coffee substances in terms of free stable radical 22diphenyl1picrylhydrazyl 50 inhibition i50 dpphthe caffeinated coffee had a slightly higher antioxidant capacity than decaffeinated espresso coffee i50 dpph 113002 vs 130003 μl p0001we suggest that the unfavourable effects observed after caffeinated coffee ingestion are due to caffeine and that the antioxidant activity is responsible for the increased fmd observed after decaffeinated coffee ingestionfurther clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to understand the chronic effects of coffee consumption on health
