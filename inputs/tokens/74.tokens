objectives the aims of the present study were to compare the distribution and accumulation of body fat in women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos and healthy controls matched for age and body mass index bmi and to investigate the association between androgen levels insulin resistance and fat distributionmaterials and methods thirtyone pcos women and 29 age and bmimatched healthy control women were evaluated in terms of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness determined with a skinfold caliper and body composition analyzed by bioelectrical impedance analysisblood samples were obtained for determination of folliclestimulating hormone luteinizing hormone 17betaestradiol 17hydroxyprogesterone basal prolactin testosterone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate sex hormonebinding globulin shbg androstenedione insulin and glucose levelsinsulin sensitivity was estimated by fasting glucoseinsulin ratio and free androgen index fai was calculated as 100 x testosteroneshbgdifferences between means were analyzed by students t test or the mannwhitney u test according to distribution of the datacorrelation analysis was performed between the body fat distribution and parameters concerning insulin resistance and androgensresults fai was significantly higher in patients with pcos compared with the control group p  0001fasting insulin was significantly higher and fasting glucoseinsulin ratio was significantly lower in the pcos group vs controls p  003 and 0001 respectivelythere was significantly less subcutaneous adipose tissue in the controls than the pcos women at the triceps p  004 and subscapular region p  004waisttohip ratio of pcos women was significantly higher than that of control subjects p  004conclusion upperhalf type body fat distribution is linked with pcos high free testosterone levels and insulin resistance
