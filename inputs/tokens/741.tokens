purpose to evaluate the correlation of the diffusion values in lumbar intervertebral disks with lumbar artery status and the degree of disk degenerationmaterials and methods sagittal t2weighted images of the lumbar spine were obtained in 37 asymptomatic volunteers aged 2268 yearsthe apparent diffusion coefficient adc of 98 lumbar intervertebral disks was determined and twodimensional timeofflight magnetic resonance angiography was performed on the corresponding 98 lumbar artery pairs total arteries  196the degree of disk degeneration and the status of lumbar arteries were evaluated independently by two radiologistsadc calculations were performed on the basis of the average signal intensities of the selected region of interest in lumbar disksthe association between adc values of disks the disk degeneration and the status of lumbar arteries of the same level were analyzed with analysis of covariance and pairwise analysis between groups scheff√© post hoc multiple comparison was performed with statistical softwarep values less than 01 were considered significantresults the lumbar arterial status correlated strongly with the diffusion values of intervertebral disks and the adc values decreased with higher degrees of arterial narrowingthe correlation between disk degeneration and diffusion was not significanteight severely degenerated disks with normal lumbar artery status and diffusion values were foundconclusion impaired flow in lumbar arteries is significantly associated with decreased diffusion in lumbar disks and may play an important role in disk degeneration
