using data from 16 published reports the authors correlated macroscopic disc degeneration grades with age sex and spine level in 600 lumbar intervertebral discs from 273 cadavers ages 096 yearsmale discs were more degenerated than female discs at most ages significantly so in the second fifth sixth and seventh decadeson average l4l5 and l3l4 level discs showed more degeneration than discs at other lumbar levelsthese macroscopic findings corroborate radiographic data from epidemiologic studiesthe calculations suggest that higher mechanical stress perhaps combined with longer nutritional pathways may be responsible for the earlier degeneration of male discs
