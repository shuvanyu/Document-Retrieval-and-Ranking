study design a crosssectional analysis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine and cholesterol levels on patients with longterm nonspecific lower back painobjectives to evaluate whether occlusion of lumbar and middle sacral arteries or serum cholesterol levels are associated with lower back pain andor with disc degenerationsummary of background data atherosclerosis in the wall of the abdominal aorta usually develops at the ostia of branching arteries and the bifurcation and may obliterate orifices of lumbar and middle sacral arteriesobstruction of these arteries causes ischemia in the lumbar spine and may result in back symptoms and disc degenerationmethods mr aortography and cholesterol blood tests were performed on 51 patients with longterm lower back pain without specific findings ie spinal or nerve root compression in regular lumbar mr imagesthe patients ranged from 35 to 70 years of age mean age 56 yearsserum cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels were measuredto assess symptoms and disability nass low back outcome instrument was usedresults twentynine 78 of 37 men and 11 77 of 14 women showed occluded lumbar andor middle sacral arteriesthe prevalence of occluded arteries was 25 times more than in subjects of corresponding age group in a finnish necropsy materialtwentythree 62 men and seven 50 women had significant disc degenerationdisc degeneration was associated with occluded lumbarmiddle sacral arteries p  0035patients with occluded arteries or significant disc degeneration did not complain more severe symptoms than those without whereas patients with above normal serum ldl cholesterol scored higher in neurogenic symptoms p  0031 and complained more often severe pain p  0049 than those with normal ldl cholesterolconclusions the study indicates that lumbar and middle sacral arteries are often occluded in patients with nonspecific longterm lower back painocclusion of these arteries may also be associated with disc degeneration
