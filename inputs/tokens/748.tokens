study design a review of the literature on disc nutritionobjectives to summarize the information on disc nutrition in relation to disc degenerationsummary of the background data the disc is avascular and the disc cells depend on diffusion from blood vessels at the discs margins to supply the nutrients essential for cellular activity and viability and to remove metabolic wastes such as lactic acidthe nutrient supply can fail due to changes in blood supply sclerosis of the subchondral bone or endplate calcification all of which can block transport from blood supply to the disc or due to changes in cellular demandmethods a review of the studies on disc blood supply solute transport studies of solute transport in animal and human disc in vitro and of theoretical modeling studies that have examined factors affecting disc nutritionresults small nutrients such as oxygen and glucose are supplied to the discs cells virtually entirely by diffusion convective transport arising from loadinduced fluid movement in and out of the disc has virtually no direct influence on transport of these nutrientsconsequently there are steep concentration gradients of oxygen glucose and lactic acid across the disc oxygen and glucose concentrations are lowest in the center of the nucleus where lactic acid concentrations are greatestthe actual levels of concentration depend on the balance between diffusive transport and cellular demand and can fall to critical levels if the endplate calcifies or nutritional demand increasesconclusions loss of nutrient supply can lead to cell death loss of matrix production and increase in matrix degradation and hence to disc degeneration
