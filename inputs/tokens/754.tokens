the intake of added sugars such as from table sugar sucrose and highfructose corn syrup has increased dramatically in the last hundred years and correlates closely with the rise in obesity metabolic syndrome and diabetesfructose is a major component of added sugars and is distinct from other sugars in its ability to cause intracellular atp depletion nucleotide turnover and the generation of uric acidin this article we revisit the hypothesis that it is this unique aspect of fructose metabolism that accounts for why fructose intake increases the risk for metabolic syndromerecent studies show that fructoseinduced uric acid generation causes mitochondrial oxidative stress that stimulates fat accumulation independent of excessive caloric intakethese studies challenge the longstanding dogma that a calorie is just a calorie and suggest that the metabolic effects of food may matter as much as its energy contentthe discovery that fructosemediated generation of uric acid may have a causal role in diabetes and obesity provides new insights into pathogenesis and therapies for this important disease
