what do the atkins diet and the traditional japanese diet have in commonthe atkins diet is low in carbohydrate and usually high in fat the japanese diet is high in carbohydrate and usually low in fatyet both work to promote weight lossone commonality of both diets is that they both eliminate the monosaccharide fructosesucrose table sugar and its synthetic sister high fructose corn syrup consist of 2 molecules glucose and fructoseglucose is the molecule that when polymerized forms starch which has a high glycemic index generates an insulin response and is not particularly sweetfructose is found in fruit does not generate an insulin response and is very sweetfructose consumption has increased worldwide paralleling the obesity and chronic metabolic disease pandemicsugar ie fructosecontaining mixtures has been vilified by nutritionists for ages as a source of empty calories no different from any other empty caloriehowever fructose is unlike glucosein the hypercaloric glycogenreplete state intermediary metabolites from fructose metabolism overwhelm hepatic mitochondrial capacity which promotes de novo lipogenesis and leads to hepatic insulin resistance which drives chronic metabolic diseasefructose also promotes reactive oxygen species formation which leads to cellular dysfunction and aging and promotes changes in the brains reward system which drives excessive consumptionthus fructose can exert detrimental health effects beyond its calories and in ways that mimic those of ethanol its metabolic cousinindeed the only distinction is that because fructose is not metabolized in the central nervous system it does not exert the acute neuronal depression experienced by those imbibing ethanolthese metabolic and hedonic analogies argue that fructose should be thought of as alcohol without the buzz
