starch in white wheat bread wb induces high postprandial glucose and insulin responsesfor rye bread rb the glucose response is similar whereas the insulin response is lowerin vitro studies suggest that polyphenolrich berries may reduce digestion and absorption of starch and thereby suppress postprandial glycemia but the evidence in humans is limitedwe investigated the effects of berries consumed with wb or rb on postprandial glucose and insulin responseshealthy females n  1320 participated in 3 randomized controlled crossover 2h meal studiesthey consumed wb or rb both equal to 50 g available starch with 150 g wholeberry pur√©e or the same amount of bread without berries as referencein study 1 wb was served with strawberries bilberries or lingonberries and in study 2 with raspberries cloudberries or chokeberriesin study 3 wb or rb was served with a mixture of berries consisting of equal amounts of strawberries bilberries cranberries and blackcurrantsstrawberries bilberries lingonberries and chokeberries consumed with wb and the berry mixture consumed with wb or rb significantly reduced the postprandial insulin responseonly strawberries 36 and the berry mixture with wb 38 with rb 19 significantly improved the glycemic profile of the breadsthese results suggest than when wb is consumed with berries less insulin is needed for maintenance of normal or slightly improved postprandial glucose metabolismthe lower insulin response to rb compared with wb can also be further reduced by berries
