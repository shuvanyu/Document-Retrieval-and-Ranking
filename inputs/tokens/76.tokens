approximately 2030 of pcos women demonstrate excess adrenal precursor androgen apa production primarily using dheas as a marker of apa in general and more specifically dhea synthesisthe role of apa excess in determining or causing pcos is unclear although observations in patients with inherited apa excess eg patients with 21hydroxylase deficient congenital classic or nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia demonstrate that apa excess can result in a pcoslike phenotypeinherited defects of the enzymes responsible for steroid biosynthesis or defects in cortisol metabolism account for only a very small fraction of women suffering from hyperandrogenism or apa excessrather women with pcos and apa excess appear to have a generalized exaggeration in adrenal steroidogenesis in response to acth stimulation although they do not have an overt hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis dysfunctionin general extraadrenal factors including obesity insulin and glucose levels and ovarian secretions play a limited role in the increased apa production observed in pcossubstantial heritabilities of apas particularly dheas have been found in the general population and in women with pcos however the handful of snps discovered to date account only for a small portion of the inheritance of these traitsparadoxically and as in men elevated levels of dheas appear to be protective against cardiovascular risk in women although the role of dheas in modulating this risk in women with pcos remains unknownin summary the exact cause of apa excess in pcos remains unclear although it may reflect a generalized and inherited exaggeration in androgen biosynthesis of an inherited naturecopyright  2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
