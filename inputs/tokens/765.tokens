in recent years it has been shown that platelets are not only involved in the arterial thrombotic process but also that they play an active role in the inflammatory process of atherogenesis from the beginningthe interaction between platelets and endothelial cells occurs in two manners activated platelets unite with intact endothelial cells or platelets in resting adhere to activated endotheliumin this context inhibition of the platelet function adhesionaggregation could contribute to the prevention of atherothrombosis the leading cause of cardiovascular morbiditythis can be achieved with antiplatelet agentshowever at the public health level the level of primary prevention a healthy diet has also been shown to exert beneficial effectsamong those elements of a healthy diet the consumption of tomatoes solanum lycopersicum l stands out for its effect on platelet antiaggregation activity and endothelial protection which may be beneficial for cardiovascular healththis article briefly discusses the involvement of platelets in atherogenesis and the possible mechanisms of action provided by tomatoes for platelet antiaggregation activity and endothelial protection
