among all fruits tested in vitro for their antiplatelet property tomato had the highest activity followed by grapefruit melon and strawberry whereas pear and apple had little or no activitytomato extract 2050 microl of 100 juice inhibited both adp and collageninduced aggregation by up to 70 but could not inhibit arachidonic acidinduced platelet aggregation and concomitant thromboxane synthesis under similar experimental conditionsthe antiplatelet components mw 1000 da in tomatoes are water soluble heat stable and are concentrated in the yellow fluid around the seedsthe active fractions were separated using gel filtration and hplcthe aqueous fraction 110 000 xg supernatant of tomatoes containing antiplatelet activity was subjected to gel filtration column chromatography biogel p2 columnthe activity was fractionated into two peaks peak3 and peak4 major peaksubsequently peak4 was further purified by hplc using a reversedphase columnnmr and mass spectroscopy studies indicated that peak f2 obtained from peak 4 contained adenosine and cytidinedeamination of peak f2 with adenosine deaminase almost completely abolished its antiplatelet activity confirming the presence of adenosine in this fractionin comparison deamination of peak4 resulted in only partial loss of inhibitory activity while the activity of peak3 remained unaffectedthese results indicate that tomatoes contain antiplatelet compounds in addition to adenosineunlike aspirin the tomatoderived compounds inhibit thrombininduced platelet aggregationall these data indicate that tomato contains very potent antiplatelet components and consuming tomatoes might be beneficial both as a preventive and therapeutic regime for cardiovascular disease
