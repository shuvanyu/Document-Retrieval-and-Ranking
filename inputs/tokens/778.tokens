objective to relate dietary fat types to cognitive change in healthy communitybased eldersmethods among 6183 older participants in the womens health study we related intake of major fatty acids fas saturated sfa monounsaturated mufa total polyunsaturated pufa transunsaturated to latelife cognitive trajectoryserial cognitive testing conducted over 4 years began 5 years postdietary assessmentprimary outcomes were global cognition averaging tests of general cognition verbal memory and semantic fluency and verbal memory averaging tests of recallwe used analyses of response profiles and logistic regression to estimate multivariableadjusted differences in cognitive trajectory and risk of worst cognitive change worst 10 by fat intakeresults higher sfa intake was associated with worse global cognitive plineartrend0008 and verbal memory plineartrend001 trajectoriesthere was a higher risk of worst cognitive change comparing highest vs lowest sfa quintiles the multivariableadjusted odds ratio or 95 confidence interval ci was 164 104258 for global cognition and 165 104261 for verbal memoryby contrast higher mufa intake was related to better global cognitive plineartrend0001 and verbal memory plineartrend0009 trajectories and lower or 95 ci of worst cognitive change in global cognition 052 031088 and verbal memory 056 034094total fat pufa and trans fat intakes were not associated with cognitive trajectoryinterpretation higher sfa intake was associated with worse global cognitive and verbal memory trajectories while higher mufa intake was related to better trajectoriesthus different consumption levels of the major specific fat types rather than total fat intake itself appeared to influence cognitive aging
