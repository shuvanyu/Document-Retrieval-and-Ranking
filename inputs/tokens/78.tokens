the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of metformin in addition to diet and exercise on endocrine and metabolic disturbances in women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos in a prospective doubleblind randomized placebo pbo control trialthirty women with insulin resistance and pcos received lifestyle modification and 1500 mg of metformin or placebo for 4 monthsbefore and after treatment body mass index waisthip ratio blood pressure hirsutism and menstrual patterns were evaluatedserum concentrations of gonadotropins androgens progesterone glucose insulin and lipids were measuredlifestyle interventions resulted in similar weight and menstrual cycles improvements in both groupsa significant reduction in serum fasting insulin homa index waist and testosterone levels was only observed with metforminthere were no significant changes in androstenedione dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate gonadotropins and lipids levelsno other changes were observed in hirsutism or blood pressurethese findings suggest that metformin has an additive effect to diet and exercise to improve parameters of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistancealthough a small decrease in body weight trough lifestyle changes could be enough to improve menstrual cycles in insulinresistant women with pcos
