summary objectives the insulinlike growth factor igf signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous tumor types including nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclcfigitumumab is a fully human igg2 monoclonal antibody against igf1 receptor igf1rmethods this phase i openlabel doseescalation study clinicaltrialsgov nct00603538 assessed the safety and tolerability of figitumumab 6 10 and 20 mgkg in combination with carboplatin area under the curve 6 mgminml and paclitaxel 200 mgm2 in japanese patients n  19 with chemotherapynaïve advanced nsclctreatments were administered intravenously on day 1 of a 21day cycle for four to six cyclespharmacokinetics biomarkers and antitumor activity were also evaluatedresults figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated at doses up to 20 mgkg no doselimiting toxicities were observed at this dose levelwhen given in combination figitumumab plasma exposure increased in an approximately doseproportional mannerthe approximate 2fold accumulation following repeated administration supported the 21day regimen as appropriate for figitumumab administrationserum total igf1 and igf binding protein3 concentrations increased following figitumumab dosing but a clear dosedependent relationship was not demonstratedseven of 18 evaluable patients experienced a partial responseconclusions figitumumab 20 mgkg in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated in chemotherapynaïve japanese patients with nsclcfurther analysis of biomarker data is necessary for the development of figitumumab therapy
