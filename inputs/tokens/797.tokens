background insulinlike growth factor igfi and its main binding protein igfbp3 modulate cell growth and survival and are thought to be important in tumour developmentcirculating concentrations of igfi might be associated with an increased risk of cancer whereas igfbp3 concentrations could be associated with a decreased cancer riskmethods we did a systematic review and metaregression analysis of casecontrol studies including studies nested in cohorts of the association between concentrations of igfi and igfbp3 and prostate colorectal premenopausal and postmenopausal breast and lung cancerstudyspecific doseresponse slopes were obtained by relating the natural log of odds ratios for different exposure levels to blood concentrations normalised to a percentile scalefindings we identified 21 eligible studies 26 datasets which included 3609 cases and 7137 controlshigh concentrations of igfi were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer odds ratio comparing 75th with 25th percentile 149 95 ci 114195 and premenopausal breast cancer 165 126208 and high concentrations of igfbp3 were associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer 151 101227associations were larger in assessments of plasma samples than in serum samples and in standard casecontrol studies compared with nested studiesinterpretation circulating concentrations of igfi and igfbp3 are associated with an increased risk of common cancers but associations are modest and vary between sitesalthough laboratory methods need to be standardised these epidemiological observations could have major implications for assessment of risk and prevention of cancer
