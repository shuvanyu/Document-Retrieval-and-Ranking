this review explores the potential adverse impact of the increasing phosphorus content in the american diet on renal cardiovascular and bone health of the general populationincreasingly studies show that phosphorus intakes in excess of the nutrient needs of a healthy population may significantly disrupt the hormonal regulation of phosphate calcium and vitamin d which contributes to disordered mineral metabolism vascular calcification impaired kidney function and bone lossmoreover large epidemiologic studies suggest that mild elevations of serum phosphate within the normal range are associated with cardiovascular disease cvd risk in healthy populations without evidence of kidney diseasehowever few studies linked high dietary phosphorus intake to mild changes in serum phosphate because of the nature of the study design and inaccuracies in the nutrient composition databasesalthough phosphorus is an essential nutrient in excess it could be linked to tissue damage by a variety of mechanisms involved in the endocrine regulation of extracellular phosphate specifically the secretion and action of fibroblast growth factor 23 and parathyroid hormonedisordered regulation of these hormones by high dietary phosphorus may be key factors contributing to renal failure cvd and osteoporosisalthough systematically underestimated in national surveys phosphorus intake seemingly continues to increase as a result of the growing consumption of highly processed foods especially restaurant meals fast foods and convenience foodsthe increased cumulative use of ingredients containing phosphorus in food processing merits further study given what is now being shown about the potential toxicity of phosphorus intake when it exceeds nutrient needs
