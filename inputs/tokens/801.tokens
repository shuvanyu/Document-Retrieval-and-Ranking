a considerable amount of evidence is consistent with the proposition that systemic igfi activity acts as pacesetter in the aging processa reduction in igfi activity is the common characteristic of rodents whose maximal lifespan has been increased by a wide range of genetic or dietary measures including caloric restrictionthe lifespans of breeds of dogs and strains of rats tend to be inversely proportional to their mature weight and igfi levelsthe link between igfi and aging appears to be evolutionarily conserved in worms and flies lifespan is increased by reductionoffunction mutations in signaling intermediates homologous to those which mediate insulinigfi activity in mammalsthe fact that an increase in igfi activity plays a key role in the induction of sexual maturity is consistent with a broader role forigfi in aging regulationif downregulation of igfi activity could indeed slow aging in humans a range of practical measures for achieving this may be at handthese include a lowfat wholefood vegan diet exercise training soluble fiber insulin sensitizers appetite suppressants and agents such as flax lignans oral estrogen or tamoxifen that decrease hepatic synthesis of igfimany of these measures would also be expected to decrease risk for common agerelated diseasesregimens combining several of these approaches might have a sufficient impact on igfi activity to achieve a useful retardation of the aging processhowever in light of the fact that igfi promotes endothelial production of nitric oxide and may be of especial importance to cerebrovascular health additional measures for stroke preventionmost notably salt restrictionmay be advisable when attempting to downregulate igfi activity as a prolongevity strategy
