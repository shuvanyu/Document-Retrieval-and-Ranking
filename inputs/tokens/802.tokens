methods during the 1980s the national cancer institute conducted three casecontrol studies of nhl in the midwestern united statesthese pooled data were used to examine pesticide exposures in farming as risk factors for nhl in menthe large sample size n  3417 allowed analysis of 47 pesticides simultaneously controlling for potential confounding by other pesticides in the model and adjusting the estimates based on a prespecified variance to make them more stableresults reported use of several individual pesticides was associated with increased nhl incidence including organophosphate insecticides coumaphos diazinon and fonofos insecticides chlordane dieldrin and copper acetoarsenite and herbicides atrazine glyphosate and sodium chloratea subanalysis of these potentially carcinogenic pesticides suggested a positive trend of risk with exposure to increasing numbersconclusion consideration of multiple exposures is important in accurately estimating specific effects and in evaluating realistic exposure scenarios
