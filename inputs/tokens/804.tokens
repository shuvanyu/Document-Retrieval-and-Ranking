the united states environmental protection agency and other regulatory agencies around the world have registered glyphosate as a broadspectrum herbicide for use on multiple food and nonfood use cropsglyphosate is widely considered by regulatory authorities and scientific bodies to have no carcinogenic potential based primarily on results of carcinogenicity studies of rats and miceto examine potential cancer risks in humans we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humanswe also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosateseven cohort studies and fourteen casecontrol studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomesour review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer in adults or children or any sitespecific cancer and exposure to glyphosatedata from biomonitoring studies underscore the importance of exposure assessment in epidemiologic studies and indicate that studies should incorporate not only duration and frequency of pesticide use but also type of pesticide formulationbecause generic exposure assessments likely lead to exposure misclassification it is recommended that exposure algorithms be validated with biomonitoring datacopyright  2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
