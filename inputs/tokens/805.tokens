we previously demonstrated that the frequency of birth defects among children of residents of the red river valley rrv minnesota usa was significantly higher than in other major agricultural regions of the state during the years 19891991 with children born to male pesticide applicators having the highest riskthe present smaller crosssectional study of 695 families and 1532 children conducted during 19971998 provides a more detailed examination of reproductive health outcomes in farm families ascertained from parentreported birth defectsin the present study in the first year of life the birth defect rate was 313 births per 1000 with 83 of the total reported birth defects confirmed by medical recordsinclusion of children identified with birth or developmental disorders within the first 3 years of life and later led to a rate of 470 per 1000 72 children from 1532 live birthsconceptions in spring resulted in significantly more children with birth defects than found in any other season 76 vs 37twelve families had more than one child with a birth defect n  28 childrenfortytwo percent of the children from families with recurrent birth defects were conceived in spring a significantly higher rate than that for any other seasonthree families in the kinships defined contributed a firstdegree relative other than a sibling with the same or similar birth defect consistent with a mendelian inheritance patternthe remaining nine families did not follow a mendelian inheritance patternthe sex ratio of children with birth defects born to applicator families shows a male predominance 175 to 1 across specific pesticide class use and exposure categories exclusive of fungicidesin the fungicide exposure category normal female births significantly exceed male births 125 to 1similarly the proportion of male to female children with birth defects is significantly lower 057 to 1 p  002adverse neurologic and neurobehavioral developmental effects clustered among the children born to applicators of the fumigant phosphine odds ratio or  248 confidence interval ci 1251use of the herbicide glyphosate yielded an or of 36 ci 1396 in the neurobehavioral categoryfinally these studies point out that a herbicides applied in the spring may be a factor in the birth defects observed and b fungicides can be a significant factor in the determination of sex of the children of the families of the rrvthus two distinct classes of pesticides seem to have adverse effects on different reproductive outcomesbiologically based confirmatory studies are needed
