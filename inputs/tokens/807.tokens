glyphosate surfactant herbicide glysh toxicity is an uncommon poisoningwe report two fatalities involving suicidal ingestion of this herbicideboth deaths occurred despite early recognition of the serious nature of the poisoning and aggressive treatmentthe deaths in this series are analysed in the context of a review of existing literaturealthough traditionally regarded as minimally toxic many deaths have been reported following suicidal ingestionsevere glysh toxicity may be refractory even to the most intensive supportive carethe triad of pulmonary oedema metabolic acidosis and hyperkalaemia portends poor outcomewhile containing a carbon phosphorus moiety glysh does not exhibit organophosphate toxicitya clinical guide to assessing severity of glysh toxicity is proposed and treatment modalities discussed
