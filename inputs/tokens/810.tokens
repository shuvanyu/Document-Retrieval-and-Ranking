glyphosate is a herbicide widely used to kill weeds both in agricultural and nonagricultural landscapesits reproductive toxicity is related to the inhibition of a star protein and an aromatase enzyme which causes an in vitro reduction in testosterone and estradiol synthesisstudies in vivo about this herbicide effects in prepubertal wistar rats reproductive development were not performed at this momentevaluations included the progression of puberty body development the hormonal production of testosterone estradiol and corticosterone and the morphology of the testisresults showed that the herbicide 1 significantly changed the progression of puberty in a dosedependent manner 2 reduced the testosterone production in semineferous tubules morphology decreased significantly the epithelium height p  0001 control  858  28 microm 5 mgkg  719  53 microm 50 mgkg  691  17 microm 250 mgkg  652  13 microm and increased the luminal diameter p  001 control  940  57 microm 5 mgkg  1166  66 microm 50 mgkg  1143  31 microm 250 mgkg  1303  48 microm 4 no difference in tubular diameter was observed and 5 relative to the controls no differences in serum corticosterone or estradiol levels were detected but the concentrations of testosterone serum were lower in all treated groups p  0001 control  1545  129 ngdl 5 mgkg  1086  196 ngdl 50 mgdl  845  122 ngdl 250 mgkg  769  142 ngdlthese results suggest that commercial formulation of glyphosate is a potent endocrine disruptor in vivo causing disturbances in the reproductive development of rats when the exposure was performed during the puberty period
