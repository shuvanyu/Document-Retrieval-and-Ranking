roundup is the major herbicide used worldwide in particular on genetically modified plants that have been designed to tolerate itwe have tested the toxicity and endocrine disruption potential of roundup bioforce on human embryonic 293 and placentalderived jeg3 cells but also on normal human placenta and equine testisthe cell lines have proven to be suitable to estimate hormonal activity and toxicity of pollutantsthe median lethal dose ld50 of roundup with embryonic cells is 03 within 1 h in serumfree medium and it decreases to reach 006 containing among other compounds 127 mm glyphosate after 72 h in the presence of serumin these conditions the embryonic cells appear to be 24 times more sensitive than the placental onesin all instances roundup generally used in agriculture at 12 ie with 2142 mm glyphosate is more efficient than its active ingredient glyphosate suggesting a synergistic effect provoked by the adjuvants present in roundupwe demonstrated that serumfree cultures even on a shortterm basis 1 h reveal the xenobiotic impacts that are visible 12 days later in serumwe also document at lower nonovertly toxic doses from 001 with 210 microm glyphosate in 24 h that roundup is an aromatase disruptorthe direct inhibition is temperaturedependent and is confirmed in different tissues and species cell lines from placenta or embryonic kidney equine testicular or human fresh placental extractsfurthermore glyphosate acts directly as a partial inactivator on microsomal aromatase independently of its acidity and in a dosedependent mannerthe cytotoxic and potentially endocrinedisrupting effects of roundup are thus amplified with timetaken together these data suggest that roundup exposure may affect human reproduction and fetal development in case of contaminationchemical mixtures in formulations appear to be underestimated regarding their toxic or hormonal impact
