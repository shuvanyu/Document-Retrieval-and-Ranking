this article describes the nutrient and elemental composition including residues of herbicides and pesticides of 31 soybean batches from iowa usathe soy samples were grouped into three different categories i genetically modified glyphosatetolerant soy gmsoy ii unmodified soy cultivated using a conventional chemical cultivation regime and iii unmodified soy cultivated using an organic cultivation regimeorganic soybeans showed the healthiest nutritional profile with more sugars such as glucose fructose sucrose and maltose significantly more total protein zinc and less fibre than both conventional and gmsoyorganic soybeans also contained less total saturated fat and total omega6 fatty acids than both conventional and gmsoygmsoy contained high residues of glyphosate and ampa mean 33 and 57 mgkg respectivelyconventional and organic soybean batches contained none of these agrochemicalsusing 35 different nutritional and elemental variables to characterise each soy sample we were able to discriminate gm conventional and organic soybeans without exception demonstrating substantial nonequivalence in compositional characteristics for readytomarket soybeanscopyright  2013 the authorspublished by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
