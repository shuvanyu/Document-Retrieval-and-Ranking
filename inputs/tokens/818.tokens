the composition of glyphosatetolerant roundup ready soybean 4032 was compared with that of conventional soybean grown in romania in 2005 as part of a comparative safety assessment programsamples were collected from replicated field trials and compositional analyses were performed to measure proximates moisture fat ash protein and carbohydrates by calculation fiber amino acids fatty acids isoflavones raffinose stachyose phytic acid trypsin inhibitor and lectin in grain as well as proximates and fiber in foragethe mean values for all biochemical components assessed for roundup ready soybean 40302 were similar to those of the conventional control and were within the published range observed for commercial soybeanthe compositional profile of roundup ready soybean 4032 was also compared to that of conventional soybean varieties grown in romania by calculating a 99 tolerance interval to describe compositional variability in the population of traditional soybean varieties already on the marketplacethese comparisons together with the history of the safe use of soybean as a common component of animal feed and human food lead to the conclusion that roundup ready soybean 4032 is compositionally equivalent to and as safe and nutritious as conventional soybean varieties grown commercially
