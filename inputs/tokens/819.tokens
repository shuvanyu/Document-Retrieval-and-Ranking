the global area covered with transgenic genetically modified crops has rapidly increased since their introduction in the mid1990smost of these crops have been rendered herbicide resistant for which it can be envisaged that the modification has an impact on the profile and level of herbicide residues within these cropsin this article the four main categories of herbicide resistance including resistance to acetolactatesynthase inhibitors bromoxynil glufosinate and glyphosate are reviewedthe topics considered are the molecular mechanism underlying the herbicide resistance the nature and levels of the residues formed and their impact on the residue definition and maximum residue limits mrls defined by the codex alimentarius commission and national authoritiesno general conclusions can be drawn concerning the nature and level of residues which has to be done on a casebycase basisinternational residue definitions and mrls are still lacking for some herbicidecrop combinations and harmonisation is therefore recommendedcopyright  2011 society of chemical industry
