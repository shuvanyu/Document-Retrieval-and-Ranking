objective we performed this study as a pilot experiment to investigate the short term effects of two diets of varying composition on weight loss as the primary outcome in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos seeking fertilitydesign randomized clinical trialsetting academic medical centerpatients thirtyfive obese women with pcosinterventions we examined the effects of a 1month dietary intervention on the pcos phenotypeparticipants were randomized to one of two energyrestricted diets high protein hp 30 protein 40 carbohydrate and 30 fat or high carbohydrate hc 15 protein 55 carbohydrate and 30 fatthe fat content was held constant in both dietsmain outcome measures primary  change in body weight secondary  biometric hormonal lipid and lipoprotein and markers of glucose homeostasis and energy metabolismresults twentysix women completed the studyboth the hp 37  19 kg and hc 44  15 kg diets resulted in significant weight loss but there was no significant difference in mean weight loss between the two groupsthere were also no differences between diets on a variety of measures including circulating androgens measures of glucose metabolism and leptinhowever the effects of a hypocaloric diet per se on improving metabolic and reproductive abnormalities in a group of pcos women were marked by a decline in circulating androgens p03 fasting and area under the curve auc insulins p05 on a 3hour oral glucose tolerance test ogtt and fasting and auc leptin levels p0001there was a high prevalence of menstrual bleeding during the trial 14 out of 26 patientsconclusions those who completed the shortterm hypocaloric diet had a significant weight loss and a significant improvement in their reproductive and metabolic abnormalitiesthere was no increased benefit to a highprotein dietfuture diet studies evaluating the ideal composition of a hypocaloric diet in women with pcos will require a large study population and will most likely require a multicenter trial
