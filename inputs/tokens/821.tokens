our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tractaccording to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory systemduring digestion proteins and dna are thought to be degraded into small constituents amino acids and nucleic acids respectively and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation systemhere based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies we report evidence that mealderived dna fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation systemin one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant dna is higher than the human dnathe plant dna concentration shows a surprisingly precise lognormal distribution in the plasma samples while nonplasma cord blood control sample was found to be free of plant dna
