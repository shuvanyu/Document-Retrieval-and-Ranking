the discovery of myostatin and our introduction to the mighty mouse over a decade ago spurred both basic and applied research and impacted popular culture as wellthe myostatinnull genotype produces double muscling in mice and livestock and was recently described in a childthe fields rapid growth is by no means surprising considering the potential benefits of enhancing muscle growth in clinical and agricultural settingsindeed several recent studies suggest that blocking myostatins inhibitory effects could improve the clinical treatment of several muscle growth disorders whereas comparative studies suggest that these actions are at least partly conservedthus neutralizing myostatins effects could also have agricultural significanceextrapolating between studies that use different vertebrate models particularly fish and mammals is somewhat confusing because whole genome duplication events have resulted in the production and retention of up to four unique myostatin genes in some fish speciessuch comparisons however suggest that myostatins actions may not be limited to skeletal muscle per se but may additionally influence other tissues including cardiac muscle adipocytes and the brainthus therapeutic intervention in the clinic or on the farm must consider the potential of alternative side effects that could impact these or other tissuesin addition the presence of multiple and actively diversifying myostatin genes in most fish species provides a unique opportunity to study adaptive molecular evolutionit may also provide insight into myostatins nonmuscle actions as results from these and other comparative studies gain visibility in biomedical fields
