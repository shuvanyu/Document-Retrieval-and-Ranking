the emission of microorganisms especially resistant bacteria such as methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa from poultry farms is of public interest and its occurrence and relevance are controversially discussedso far there are limited data on this issuein this study we investigated the occurrence of livestockassociated lamrsa inside and outside previously tested mrsapositive poultry barns in germanyin total five turkey and two broiler fattening farms were investigated four and three times respectivelyin a longitudinal study during one fattening period samples were collected from animals the animals environment inside the barn including the air and the barns surroundings such as ambient air and boot swabs of ground surfaces at different distances from the barnmoreover a crosssectional study was carried out once inside the barns on five turkey and four broiler farms during the last third of the fatting periodin the crosssectional study lamrsa was detected in the air of most barns 7 of 9 778 as well as in many samples originating from animals with detections levels of 50 to 54 in broiler and 62 to 77 in turkey farmsin the longitudinal study lamrsa was found in the ambient air outside two turkey barns and on the ground surface on the downwind side of many 444 turkey and broiler farmsthe same spa types of isolates were observed inside and outside the barnstransmission of mrsa within poultry farms as well as emission via the airborne route seems to be possible
