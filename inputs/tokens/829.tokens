during 1 year samples were taken on 4 days one sample in each season from pigs the floor and the air inside pig barns and from the ambient air and soil at different distances outside six commercial livestockassociated methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus lamrsapositive pig barns in the north and east of germanylamrsa was isolated from animals floor and air samples in the barn showing a range of airborne lamrsa between 6 and 3619 cfum3 median 151 cfum3downwind of the barns lamrsa was detected in low concentrations 11 to 14 cfum3 at distances of 50 and 150 m all upwind air samples were negativein contrast lamrsa was found on soil surfaces at distances of 50 150 and 300 m downwind from all barns but no statistical differences could be observed between the proportions of positive soil surface samples at the three different distancesupwind of the barns positive soil surface samples were found only sporadicallysignificantly more positive lamrsa samples were found in summer than in the other seasons both in air and soil samples upwind and downwind of the pig barnsspa typing was used to confirm the identity of lamrsa types found inside and outside the barnsthe results show that there is regular airborne lamrsa transmission and deposition which are strongly influenced by wind direction and season of up to at least 300 m around positive pig barnsthe described boot sampling method seems suitable to characterize the contamination of the vicinity of lamrsapositive pig barns by the airborne route
