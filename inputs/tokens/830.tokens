background livestockassociated mrsa lamrsa belonging to st398 lineage common among pigs and other animals emerged in central and northern europe becoming a new risk factor for mrsa among farm workersstrains belonging to st398 can be responsible for human colonization and infection mainly in areas with high livestockfarmingthe aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of livestockassociated methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus lamrsa human colonization and infections in an area of the lombardy region italy the italian region with the highest density of pig farmingmethods in the period marchapril 2010 879 nasal swabs were taken from subjects at admission to a local hospital serving an area of the lombardy region devoted to agriculture and farmingin the period march 2010february 2011 all mrsa strains from communityacquired infection cai observed in the same hospital were collectedmolecular characterization of the isolates included sccmec typing spa typing and multilocus sequence typing mlstresults out of 879 nasal swabs examined 9 1 yielded mrsafive strains were assigned to sequence type st398 spa t899 3 isolates t108 and t2922 1 isolate each and were therefore categorized as lamrsathe other 4 isolates were likely of hospital originno strains were positive for pantonvalentine leukocidin genestwenty mrsa isolates were detected from cai 17 were from skin and softtissue infections and 3 from other infectionsan mrsa isolate from otitis externa was t899st398 and pvlnegative hence categorized as lamrsafour isolates were assigned to t127st1eight strains were pvlpositive community acquired camrsa and belonged to different clones the most frequent being st8conclusions in an area of italy with high density of pig farming lamrsa is able to colonize the population and rarely to produce infectionstypical camrsa is more common than lamrsa among cai
