the decline in sperm count rates over the last 50 years appears to parallel the rising prevalence of obesityas lipids levels are strongly associated with obesity high lipids levels or hyperlipidemia may thus play an important role in the decline in fertility in addition to other environmental or lifestyle factorsthe objective of this population based cohort study was to evaluate the association between mens serum lipid concentrations and semen quality parameters among 501 male partners of couples desiring pregnancy and discontinuing contraceptioneach participant provided prospectively up to two semen samples 94 of men provided one or more semen samples and 77 of men provided a second sample approximately one month laterlinear mixed effects models were used to estimate the associations between baseline lipid concentrations and semen quality parameters adjusted for age body mass index and racewe found that higher levels of serum total cholesterol free cholesterol and phospholipids were associated with a significantly lower percentage of sperm with intact acrosome and smaller sperm head area and perimeterour results suggest that lipid concentrations may affect semen parameters specifically sperm head morphology highlighting the importance of cholesterol and lipid homeostasis for male fecundity
