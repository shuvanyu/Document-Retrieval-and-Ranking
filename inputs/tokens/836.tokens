inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme a hmgcoa reductase inhibitors could in theory adversely affect male gonadal function because cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormonesthe objective of this randomized doubleblind trial was to compare the effects of simvastatin pravastatin and placebo on gonadal testosterone production and spermatogenesisafter a 6week placebo and lipidlowering diet runin period 159 male patients aged 21 to 55 years with type iia or iib hypercholesterolemia lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol between 145 and 240 mgdl and normal basal levels of testosterone were randomly assigned to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg n  40 simvastatin 40 mg n  41 pravastatin 40 mg n  39 or placebo n  39 once dailyafter 24 weeks of treatment mean total cholesterol levels were decreased 24 to 27 and mean ldl cholesterol was decreased 30 to 34 in the 3 activetreatment groups p  001 for all comparisons to placeboat 24 weeks there were no statistically significant differences between the placebo group and any of the activetreatment groups for the change from baseline in testosterone human chorionic gonadotropin hcgstimulated testosterone free testosterone index folliclestimulating hormone fsh luteinizing hormone lh or sex hormonebinding globulin shbgmoreover there were no statistically significant differences at week 12 or week 24 for the change from baseline in sperm concentration ejaculate volume or sperm motility for any active treatment relative to placeboboth simvastatin and pravastatin were well toleratedin summary we found no evidence for clinically meaningful effects of simvastatin or pravastatin on gonadal testosterone production testosterone reserve or multiple parameters of semen quality
