oestrogens govern reproductive functions in vertebrates and are present in all animal tissuesthe theoretical maximum daily intake tmdi of oestradiol17beta by consumption of cattle meat is calculated to be 43 ngfollowing the use of oestradiolcontaining growthpromoting agents tmdi is increased by a factor of 46 to 20 ng oestradiol17beta assuming that single dosage and good animal husbandry are observedpork and poultry probably contain similar amounts of oestrogens as untreated cattlethe mean concentration of oestradiol17beta in whole milk is estimated at 64 pgmlscarce data available on eggs report up to 200 pgg oestradiol17betathe risk evaluation of oestrogenic growthpromoting agents is limited by analytical uncertaintiesresidues of oestradiol17alpha and the importance of oestrogen conjugates are widely unknownthe performance of mass spectrometry still needs to be improved for confirmation of oestrogen concentrations in most foodat present the potential relevance of oestradiol acyl esters the actual daily production rate of oestradiol in prepubertal children and the role of oestradiol metabolites in cancer are obscurethe presence of different cytoplasmic oestrogen receptor subtypes and potential oestradiol effects in nonreproductive functions require further examination
