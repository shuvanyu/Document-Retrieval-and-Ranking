longchain epadha omega3 fatty acid supplementation can be copreventative and cotherapeuticcurrent research suggests increasing accumulated long chain omega3s for health benefits and as natural medicine in several major diseasesbut many believe plant omega3 sources are nutritionally and therapeutically equivalent to the epadha omega3 in fish oilalthough healthy precursor ala bioconversion to epa is inefficient and production of dha is nearly absent limiting the protective value of ala supplementation from flaxoil for examplealong with pollutants certain fish acquire high levels of epadha as predatory specieshowever the origin of epadha in aquatic ecosystems is algaecertain microalgae produce high levels of epa or dhanow organically produced dharich microalgae oil is availableclinical trials with dharich oil indicate comparable efficacies to fish oil for protection from cardiovascular risk factors by lowering plasma triglycerides and oxidative stressthis review discusses 1 omega3 fatty acids in nutrition and medicine 2 omega3s in physiology and gene regulation 3 possible protective mechanisms of epadha in major diseases such as coronary heart disease atherosclerosis cancer and type 2 diabetes 4 epa and dha requirements considering fish oil safety and 5 microalgae epa and dharich oils and recent clinical results
