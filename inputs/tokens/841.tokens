study question is increased consumption of dairy foods associated with lower semen qualitysummary answer we found that intake of fullfat dairy was inversely related to sperm motility and morphologythese associations were driven primarily by intake of cheese and were independent of overall dietary patternswhat is known already it has been suggested that environmental estrogens could be responsible for the putative secular decline in sperm countsdairy foods contain large amounts of estrogenswhile some studies have suggested dairy as a possible contributing factor for decreased semen quality this finding has not been consistent across studiesstudy design size duration the rochester young mens study n  189 was a crosssectional study conducted between 2009 and 2010 at the university of rochesterparticipantsmaterials setting methods men aged 1822 years were included in this analysisdiet was assessed via food frequency questionnairelinear regression was used to analyze the relation between dairy intake and conventional semen quality parameters total sperm count sperm concentration progressive motility morphology and ejaculate volume adjusting for age abstinence time race smoking status body mass index recruitment period moderatetointense exercise tv watching and total calorie intakemain results and the role of chance total dairy food intake was inversely related to sperm morphology ptrend  0004this association was mostly driven by intake of fullfat dairy foodsthe adjusted difference 95 confidence interval in normal sperm morphology percent was 32 45 to 18 between men in the upper half and those in the lower half of fullfat dairy intake p  00001 while the equivalent contrast for lowfat dairy intake was less pronounced 13 27 to 007 p 006fullfat dairy intake was also associated with significantly lower percent progressively motile sperm p 005limitations reasons for caution as it was a crosssectional study causal inference is limitedwider implications of the findings further research is needed to prove a causal link between a high consumption of fullfat dairy foods and detrimental effects on semen qualityif verified our findings would mean that intake of fullfat dairy foods should be considered in attempts to explain secular trends in semen quality and that men trying to have children should restrict their intakestudy fundingcompeting interests european union seventh framework program environment developmental effects of environment on reproductive health deer grant 212844grant p30 typeentreznucleotideattrstextdk046200term_id187635970term_textdk046200dk046200 and ruth l kirschstein national research service award t32 dk00770316 from the national institutes of healthnone of the authors has any conflicts of interest to declare
