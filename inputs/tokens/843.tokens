objective to measure individual antioxidants in sperm and seminal plasma from fertile and infertile men to determine if any particular antioxidant is reduced in infertile mendesign semen samples were prepared by a discontinuous percoll gradient to separate sperm and seminal plasma and the antioxidant concentrations of each were assessedsamples also were screened for phorbol esterinduced reactive oxygen species ros activitysetting departments of obstetrics and gynaecology and clinical biochemistry the queens university of belfast northern irelandpatients fiftynine male patients attending our infertility center 18 men whose wives had ongoing pregnancies from ivf with normozoospermic semen profiles 20 infertile men with normozoospermic and 21 men with asthenozoospermic semen profilesmain outcome measures ascorbate urate sulphydryl groups tocopherol and carotenoid concentrations were measured in sperm and seminal plasma from fertile and infertile menresults in seminal plasma ascorbate contributes almost twice as much as urate and thiol levels are about one third of ascorbateascorbate levels in seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic individuals ros are significantly reducedin sperm thiols contributed most and ascorbate only a fraction of the totalconclusions in seminal plasma ascorbate urates and thiols are the major antioxidants presentin contrast within sperm this group is the major contributorin samples exhibiting ros activity ascorbate concentrations in the seminal plasma are significantly reduced
