the imbalance between reactive oxygen species ros production and total antioxidant capacity tac in seminal fluid indicates oxidative stress and is correlated with male infertilitya composite rostac score may be more strongly correlated with infertility than ros or tac alonewe measured ros tac and rostac scores in semen from 127 patients and 24 healthy controlsof the patients 56 had varicocele eight had varicocele with prostatitis 35 had vasectomy reversals and 28 had idiopathic infertilityros levels were higher among infertile men especially those with varicocele with prostatitis mean  se 325  089 and vasectomy reversals 265  101all infertile groups had significantly lower rostac scores than controlrostac score identified 80 of patients and was significantly better than ros at identifying varicocele and idiopathic infertilitythe 13 patients whose partners later achieved pregnancies had a mean rostac score of 477  132 similar to controls but significantly higher than the 39 patients who remained infertile 358  150 p  001rostac score is a novel measure of oxidative stress and is superior to ros or tac alone in discriminating between fertile and infertile meninfertile men with male factor or idiopathic diagnoses had significantly lower rostac scores than controls and men with male factor diagnoses that eventually were able to initiate a successful pregnancy had significantly higher rostac scores than those who failed
