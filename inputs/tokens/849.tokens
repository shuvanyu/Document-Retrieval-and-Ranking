background saturated fat intake has been associated with both cardiovascular disease and cancer risk and a newly published study found an association between saturated fat intake and a lower sperm concentration in infertile menobjective the objective was to examine the association between dietary fat intake and semen quality among 701 young danish men from the general populationdesign in this crosssectional study men were recruited when they were examined to determine their fitness for military service from 2008 to 2010they delivered a semen sample underwent a physical examination and answered a questionnaire comprising a quantitative foodfrequency questionnaire to assess food and nutrient intakesmultiple linear regression analyses were performed with semen variables as outcomes and dietary fat intakes as exposure variables adjusted for confoundersresults a lower sperm concentration and total sperm count in men with a high intake of saturated fat was founda significant doseresponse association was found and men in the highest quartile of saturated fat intake had a 38 95 ci 01 61 lower sperm concentration and a 41 95 ci 4 64 lower total sperm count than did men in the lowest quartileno association between semen quality and intake of other types of fat was foundconclusions our findings are of potentially great public interest because changes in diet over the past decades may be part of the explanation for the recently reported high frequency of subnormal human sperm countsa reduction in saturated fat intake may be beneficial for both general and reproductive health
