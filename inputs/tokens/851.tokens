objective to assess the relationship between dietary antioxidant intake and semen quality in young healthy males design crosssectional study setting university and college campuses in the rochester new york area patients 189 universityaged men interventions none main outcome measures semen volume total sperm count concentration motility total motile count and morphology results progressive motility was 65 95 ci 06 123 percentage units higher among men in the highest quartile of Î²carotene intake compared to men in the lowest quartilesimilar results were observed for lutein intakelycopene intake was positively related to sperm morphologythe adjusted percentages 95 ci of morphologically normal sperm in increasing quartiles of lycopene intake were 80 67 93 77 64 90 92 79 105 and 97 84 110there was a nonlinear relationship between vitamin c intake and sperm concentration with men in the second quartile of intake having on average the highest sperm concentrations and men in the top quartile of intake having the lowest concentrationsconclusions in a population of healthy young men carotenoid intake was associated with higher sperm motility and in the case of lycopene better sperm morphologyour data suggest that dietary carotenoids may have a positive impact on semen quality
