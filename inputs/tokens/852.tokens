objectives to determine seminal antioxidant capacity oxidative stress markers and their association with semen quality as oxidative stress is considered to be a major etiological factor in male infertilitysubjects and methods semen samples were obtained from 138 men and categorized on the basis of sperm count motility and morphologyseminal oxidative and antioxidant markers are as follows lipid peroxidation lpo protein carbonyls pc superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat thiols and ascorbic acid were determinedresults sperm count significantly correlated positively with progressive sperm motility and normal morphologysperm count and normal morphology showed significant negative correlation with lpo and pcsperm count and progressive motility showed significant positive relationship with sodthe sod cat and thiols positively whereas lpo and pc negatively associated with elevated sperm countconclusion insufficient antioxidant enzymes and increased oxidative stress may attribute to the risk of declining semen quality and hence protective role for antioxidant enzymes against the oxidative damage cannot be ruled outcopyright  2010 the canadian society of clinical chemistspublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
