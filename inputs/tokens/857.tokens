scope dietary polyphenols pp can be divided into two groups extractable polyphenols epp or compounds solubilized by aqueous organic solvents and nonextractable polyphenols nepp or compounds that remain in their corresponding extraction residuesmost studies on food polyphenols and dietary intakes address exclusively eppthe objective of this work was to determine the actual amount of pp including nepp in food and in a whole dietmethods and results hplcms analyses were performed to identify epp in methanolacetone extracts and nepp in the acidic hydrolyzates of their extraction residues in cereals fruits vegetables nuts and legumesnepp contents estimated as hydrolyzable pp plus nonextractable proanthocyanidins pa ranged from 880 mg100 g dry weight in fruits to 210 mg100 g in cereals and were substantially higher than the contents of eppnepp intake dayperson in the spanish diet 942 mg is higher than epp intake 258 mg fruits and vegetables 746 mg are the major contributors to the total pp intake 1201 mgconclusion non extractable polyphenols are the major part of dietary polyphenolsthe knowledge of intakes and physiological properties of nepp may be useful for a better understanding of the potential health effects of dietary pp
