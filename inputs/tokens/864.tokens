background several studies have shown that adenovirus 36 ad36 influences the risk of obesity in humansclarifying the relationship between ad36 infection and obesity could lead to more effective approaches for the management of obesitythe objective of this study was to conduct a metaanalysis to confirm the influence of ad36 infection on obesity and metabolic markersmethodologyprincipal findings we searched medline and the cochrane library for pertinent articles including their references published between 1951 and april 22 2012only english language reports of original observational studies were included in this metaanalysisdata extraction was performed independently by two reviewersweighted mean differences wmds and pooled odds ratios ors with 95 confidence intervals 95 cis were calculated using the random effects modelof 237 potentially relevant studies 10 crosssectional studies n  2870 conformed to the selection criteriapooled analysis showed that the wmd for bmi of ad36 infection compared with noninfection was 319 95 ci 144493 p0001sensitivity analysis restricted to studies of adults yielded a similar result of 318 95 ci 078557 p  0009the increased risk of obesity associated with ad36 infection was also significant or 19 95 ci 101356 p  0047no significant differences were found in relation to total cholesterol p  083 triglycerides p  064 hdl p  069 blood glucose p  008 waist circumstance p  009 and systolic blood pressure p  025conclusionsignificance ad36 infection was associated with the risk of obesity and weight gain but was not associated with abnormal metabolic markers including waist circumstanceit suggests that ad36 infection is more associated with accumulation of subcutaneous fat than that of visceral fatthe relationship between ad36 and obesity should be assessed by further studies including welldesigned prospective studies to gain a better understanding of whether ad36 plays a role in the etiology of human obesity
