the selection of meattype chickens broilers for rapid growth has been accompanied by excessive fat depositionin this study we analysed 53 candidate genes that are associated with obesity and obesityrelated traits in humans for which we found chicken orthologues by blast searcheswe have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms snps with significant differences in allele frequencies between broilers and layers in each of the following six candidate genes adrenergic beta2 receptor surface adrb2 melanocortin 5 receptor mc5r leptin receptor lepr mckusickkaufman syndrome mkks milk fat globuleegf factor 8 protein mfge8 and adenylate kinase 1 ak1to examine associations with fatness andor body weight we used birds of extreme phenotypes in f2 and backcross populations with varying levels of abdominal fat weight per cent afw and body weightwe then assessed the level of gene expression by realtime pcrin two genes adrb2 and mfge8 we found significant association with afwthe adrb2 gene was found to have a significantly higher expression in the liver of lean chickens compared with those of the fat individualswe believe that this approach can be applied for the identification of other quantitative genes 2011 the authors animal genetics  2011 stichting international foundation for animal genetics
