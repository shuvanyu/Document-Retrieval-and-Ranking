background experimental and natural human adenovirus36 adv36 infection of multiple animal species results in obesity through increasing adipogenesis and lipid accumulation in adipocytespresence of adv36 antibodies detected by serum neutralization assay has previously been associated with obesity in children and adults living in the usa south korea and italy whereas no association with adult obesity was detected in belgiumthe netherlands nor among usa military personneladv36 infection has also been shown to reduce blood lipid levels increase glucose uptake by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies and to associate with improved glycemic control in nondiabetic individualsprincipal findings using a novel elisa 1946 clinically wellcharacterized individuals including 424 children and 1522 nondiabetic adults and 89 anonymous blood donors residing in central sweden representing the population in stockholm area were studied for the presence of antibodies against adv36 in serumthe prevalence of adv36 positivity in lean individuals increased from 7 in 19921998 to 1520 in 20022009 which paralleled the increase in obesity prevalencewe found that adv36positive serology was associated with pediatric obesity and with severe obesity in females compared to lean and overweightmildly obese individuals with a 15 to 2fold adv36 positivity increase in casesmoreover adv36 positivity was less common among females and males on antilipid pharmacological treatment or with high blood triglyceride levelinsulin sensitivity measured as lower homair showed a higher point estimate in adv36positive obese females and males although it was not statistically significant p  008conclusion using a novel elisa we show that adv36 infection is associated with pediatric obesity severe obesity in adult females and lower risk of high blood lipid levels in nondiabetic swedish individuals
