the accumulation of thallium tl in brassicaceous crops is widely known but both the uptake extents of tl by the individual cultivars of green cabbage and the distribution of tl in the tissues of green cabbage are not well understoodfive commonly available cultivars of green cabbage grown in the tlspiked potculture trials were studied for the uptake extent and subcellular distribution of tlthe results showed that all the trial cultivars mainly concentrated tl in the leaves 101192Â mgkg dw rather than in the roots or stems with no significant differences among cultivars p  0455tl accumulation in the leaves revealed obvious subcellular fractionation cell cytosol and vacuole  cell wall  cell organellesthe majority  88 of leaftl was found to be in the fraction of cytosol and vacuole which also served as the major storage site for other major elements such as ca and mgthis specific subcellular fractionation of tl appeared to enable green cabbage to avoid tl damage to its vital organelles and to help green cabbage tolerate and detoxify tlthis study demonstrated that all the five green cabbage cultivars show a good application potential in the phytoremediation of tlcontaminated soils
