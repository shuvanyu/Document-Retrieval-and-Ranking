there is increasing evidence that obesity in humans is associated with infection with human adenovirus36 adv36infection of experimental animals with adv36 demonstrates that this virus causes obesityhuman studies have shown a prevalence of adv36 infection of 30 or greater in obese adult humans but a correlation with obesity has not always been demonstratedin contrast three published studies and one presented study with a total of 559 children all show that there is an increase in prevalence of adv36 infection in obese children 28 compared to nonobese children 10the explanation for the apparently more robust correlation of adv36 infection with obesity in children vs adults is not clearthe data in animals and people suggests that adv36 has contributed to the worldwide increase in childhood obesitymore research is needed to identify prevalences and consequences of adv36 infection in people of all age groups and geographic locations
