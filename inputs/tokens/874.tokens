background as protein is considered to increase thermogenesis and satiety more than other macronutrients it may have beneficial effects on prevention of weight gain and weight maintenanceobjective the objective of this study is to assess the association between the amount and type of dietary protein and subsequent changes in weight and waist circumference wcmethods 89432 men and women from five countries participating in european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic were followed for a mean of 65 yearsassociations between the intake of protein or subgroups of protein from animal and plant sources and changes in weight g per year or wc cm per year were investigated using gender and centrespecific multiple regression analysesadjustments were made for other baseline dietary factors baseline anthropometrics demographic and lifestyle factors and followup timewe used random effect metaanalyses to obtain pooled estimates across centresresults higher intake of total protein and protein from animal sources was associated with subsequent weight gain for both genders strongest among women and the association was mainly attributable to protein from red and processed meat and poultry rather than from fish and dairy sourcesthere was no overall association between intake of plant protein and subsequent changes in weightno clear overall associations between intakes of total protein or any of the subgroups and changes in wc were presentthe associations showed some heterogeneity between centres but pooling of estimates was still considered justifiedconclusion a high intake of protein was not found associated with lower weight or waist gain in this observational studyin contrast protein from food items of animal origin especially meat and poultry seemed to be positively associated with longterm weight gainthere were no clear associations for waist changes
