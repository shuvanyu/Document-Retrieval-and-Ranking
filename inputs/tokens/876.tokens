background we previously reported that human adenovirus ad36 induces adiposity and paradoxically lower levels of serum cholesterol chol and triglycerides tg in animalsobjective to evaluate the transmissibility of ad36 and ad36 induced adiposity using a chicken modeldesign experiment 1four chickens were housed two per cage and one from each cage was inoculated with ad36duration of presence of ad36 dna in the blood of all chickens was monitoredexperiment 2two groups of chickens were intranasally inoculated with ad36 infected donors id or media control donors cdblood drawn 36 h later from id and cd groups was inoculated into wing veins of recipient chickens infected receivers ir and control receivers cr respectivelyon sacrifice 5 weeks postinoculation blood was drawn body weight noted and visceral fat was separated and weighedresults experiment 1ad36 dna appeared in the blood of the inoculated chickens and that of uninoculated chickens cage mates within 12 h of inoculation and the viral dna persisted up to 25 days in the bloodexperiment 2compared with cd visceral and total body fat were significantly greater and chol significantly lower for the id and ir tg were significantly lower for the id ad36 was isolated from 12 out of 16 blood samples of the id that were used for inoculating ir chickensad36 dna was present in the blood and the adipose tissue of the id and ir but not in the skeletal muscles of animals selected randomly for testingconclusion as seen in experiment 1 ad36 infection can be transmitted horizontally from an infected chicken to another chicken sharing the cageadditionally experiment 2 demonstrated bloodborne transmission of ad36induced adiposity in chickenstransmissibility of ad36induced adiposity in chicken model raises serious concerns about such a possibility in humans that needs further investigation
