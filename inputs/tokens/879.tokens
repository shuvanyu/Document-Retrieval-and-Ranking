purpose pancreatic cancer is almost always lethal and the only us food and drug administrationapproved therapies for it gemcitabine and erlotinib produce objective responses in 10 of patientswe evaluated the clinical biological effects of curcumin diferuloylmethane a plantderived dietary ingredient with potent nuclear factorkappab nfkappab and tumor inhibitory properties against advanced pancreatic cancerexperimental design patients received 8 g curcumin by mouth daily until disease progression with restaging every 2 monthsserum cytokine levels for interleukin il6 il8 il10 and il1 receptor antagonists and peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of nfkappab and cyclooxygenase2 were monitoredresults twentyfive patients were enrolled with 21 evaluable for responsecirculating curcumin was detectable as drug in glucuronide and sulfate conjugate forms albeit at low steadystate levels suggesting poor oral bioavailabilitytwo patients showed clinical biological activityone had ongoing stable disease for 18 months interestingly one additional patient had a brief but marked tumor regression 73 accompanied by significant increases 4 to 35fold in serum cytokine levels il6 il8 il10 and il1 receptor antagonistsno toxicities were observedcurcumin downregulated expression of nfkappab cyclooxygenase2 and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients most of whom had baseline levels considerably higher than those found in healthy volunteerswhereas there was considerable interpatient variation in plasma curcumin levels drug levels peaked at 22 to 41 ngml and remained relatively constant over the first 4 weeksconclusions oral curcumin is well tolerated and despite its limited absorption has biological activity in some patients with pancreatic cancer
