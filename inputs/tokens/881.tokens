pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide with large geographical variation which implies the contribution of diet and lifestyle in its etiologywe examined the association of meat and fish consumption with risk of pancreatic cancer in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epica total of 477202 epic participants from 10 european countries recruited between 1992 and 2000 were included in our analysisuntil 2008 865 nonendocrine pancreatic cancer cases have been observedcalibrated relative risks rrs and 95 confidence intervals cis were computed using multivariableadjusted cox hazard regression modelsthe consumption of red meat rr per 50 g increase per day  103 95 ci  093114 and processed meat rr per 50 g increase per day  093 95 ci  071123 were not associated with an increased pancreatic cancer riskpoultry consumption tended to be associated with an increased pancreatic cancer risk rr per 50 g increase per day  172 95 ci  104284 however there was no association with fish consumption rr per 50 g increase per day  122 95 ci  092162our results do not support the conclusion of the world cancer research fund that red or processed meat consumption may possibly increase the risk of pancreatic cancerthe positive association of poultry consumption with pancreatic cancer might be a chance finding as it contradicts most previous findingscopyright  2012 uicc
