purpose few data are available on the role of combinations of foods andor nutrients on pancreatic cancer riskto add further information on dietary patterns potentially associated to pancreatic cancer we applied an exploratory principal component factor analysis on 28 major nutrients derived from an italian casecontrol studymethods cases were 326 incident pancreatic cancer cases and controls 652 frequencymatched controls admitted to hospital for nonneoplastic diseasesdietary information was collected through a validated and reproducible food frequency questionnairemultiple logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and major recognized risk factors for pancreatic cancer were used to estimate the odds ratios or of pancreatic cancer for each dietary patternresults we identified four dietary patternsnamed animal products unsaturated fats vitamins and fiber and starch rich that explain 75 of the total variance in nutrient intake in this populationafter allowing for all the four patterns positive associations were found for the animal products and the starch rich patterns the or for the highest versus the lowest quartiles being 203 95 confidence interval ci 129319 and 169 95 ci 102279 respectively an inverse association emerged for the vitamins and fiber pattern or 055 95 ci 035086 whereas no association was observed for the unsaturated fats pattern or 113 95 ci 071178conclusions a diet characterized by a high consumption of meat and other animal products as well as of refined cereals and sugars is positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk whereas a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is inversely associatedcopyright  2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
