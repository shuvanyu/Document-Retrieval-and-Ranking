gemcitabine is a first line cancer drug widely used for the treatment of pancreatic cancerhowever its therapeutic efficiency is significantly limited by resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to this and other chemotherapeutic drugswe have investigated the cytotoxic effect of turmeric force tf a supercritical and hydroethanolic extract of turmeric alone and in combination with gemcitabine in two pancreatic carcinoma cell lines bxpc3 and panc1tf is highly cytotoxic to bxpc3 and panc1 cell lines with ic50 values of 10 and 122 microgml respectively with superior cytotoxicity than curcumingemcitabine ic50 value for both of these cell line is 003 microgml however 3048 of the pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to gemcitabine even at concentrations 100 microgmlin comparison tf induced cell death in 96 of the cells at 50 microgmlthe combination of gemcitabine and tf was synergistic with ic90 levels achieved in both pancreatic cancer cell lines at lower concentrationscalcusyn analysis of cytotoxicity data showed that the gemcitabine  turmeric force combination has strong synergism with combination index ci values of 0050 and 0183 in bxpc3 and panc1 lines respectively at ic50 levelthis synergistic effect is due to the increased inhibitory effect of the combination on nuclear factorkappab activity and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 expression as compared to the single agent
