background this study aims to comprehensively summarize the currently available evidences on the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine plus erlotinib for treating advanced pancreatic cancermethodologyprincipal findings pubmed embase the cochrane library and abstracts of recent major conferences were systematically searched to identify relevant publicationsstudies that were conducted in advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine plus erlotinib with or without comparison with gemcitabine alone and reporting objective response rate disease control rate progressionfree survival timetoprogression overall survival 1year survival rate andor adverse events were includeddata on objective response rate disease control rate 1year survival rate and adverse events rate respectively were combined mainly by using metaanalyst software with a randomeffects modeldata on progressionfree survival timetoprogression and overall survival were summarized descriptivelysixteen studies containing 1308 advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine plus erlotinib were includedthe reported median progressionfree survival or timetoprogression median overall survival 1year survival rates objective response rates and disease control rates were 296 months 5125 months 2051 0286 and 250833 respectivelythe weighted 1year survival rate objective response rate and disease control rate based on studies reporting robust results were 279 91 and 570 respectivelyaccording to the studies with relevant data the incidences of total and severe adverse events were 963 and 629 respectivelythe most frequently reported adverse events were leucopenia rash diarrhea vomitting neutropenia thrombocytopenia anaemia stomatitis druginduced liver injury fatigue and fevercompared with gemcitabine alone the progressionfree survival and overall survival with gemcitabine plus erlotinib were significantly longer but there were also more deaths and interstitial lung diseaselike syndrome related to this treatmentconclusionssignificance gemcitabine plus erlotinib represent a new option for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with mild but clinically meaningful additive efficacy compared with gemcitabine aloneits safety profile is generally acceptable although careful management is needed for some specific adverse events
