background actin cytoskeleton is involved in actinbased cell adhesion cell motility and matrix metalloproteinasesmmps mmp2 mmp9 mmp11 and mmp14 are responsible for cell invasion in breast cancer metastasisthe dietary intake of lignan from flax seed gets converted to enterolactone el and enterodiol in the human systemhere we show that the enterolactone has a very significant antimetastatic activity as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit adhesion and invasion and migration in mcf7 and mda mb231 cell linesmaterials and methods migration inhibition assay actinbased cell motility assay along with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr for mmp2 mmp9 mmp11 and mmp14 genes were performed in mcf7 and mda mb 231 cell linesresults enterolactone seems to inhibit actinbased cell motility as evidenced by confocal imaging and photo documentation of cell migration assaythe results are supported by the observation that the enterolactone in vitro significantly downregulates the metastasisrelated metalloproteinases mmp2 mmp9 and mmp14 gene expressionsno significant alteration in the mmp11 gene expression was foundconclusions therefore we suggest that the antimetastatic activity of el is attributed to its ability to inhibit cell adhesion cell invasion and cell motilityel affects normal filopodia and lamellipodia structures polymerization of actin filaments at their leading edges and thereby inhibits actinbased cell adhesion and cell motilitythe process involves multiple forcegenerating mechanisms of actin filaments ieprotrusion traction deadhesion and tailretractionby downregulating the metastasisrelated mmp2 mmp9 and mmp14 gene expressions el may be responsible for cell invasion step of metastasis
