the first quantitative method for the determination of both lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens in plasma is presentedusing ionexchange chromatography the diphenols are separated into two fractions 1 the biologically active fraction containing the free compounds  mono and disulfates and 2 the biologically inactive fraction containing the mono and diglucuronides and the sulfoglucuronidesafter hydrolysis the fractions are further purified by solid phase extraction and ion exchange chromatographylosses during the complete procedure are corrected for using radioactive estrogen conjugates during the first steps and later by adding deuterated internal standards of all compounds measured matairesinol enterodiol enterolactone daidzein odesmethylangolensin equol and genisteinthe final determination is carried out by isotope dilution gas chromatographymass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode gcmssimthe diphenols may be measured at concentrations as low as 02 to 10 nmollresults of plasma analyses of all compounds in 27 pre and postmenopausal omnivorous and vegetarian women are presented for the first timethe most important findings are that the freesulfate fraction is low for genistein 38 of total but as much as 2125 of enterolactone and enterodiol occurs in this fractiona good correlation between plasma and urine values was foundtotal concentrations of individual compounds vary greatly between the subjects from pmoll to mumoll the vegetarians having higher values particularly one vegan subjectthe highest total enterolactone concentration value exceeded 1 mumollit is concluded that a highly specific method for the assay of 3 lignans and 4 isoflavonoids in plasma has been developedthis method will be useful in future studies of lignan and isoflavonoid metabolism
