objective since black tea contains high levels of manganese mn we investigated the relationship between dietary mn intake circulating mn levels and leucocyte expression of two mndependent enzymes in tea drinkers and nontea drinkersdesign we assessed mn intakes food frequency questionnaire fasting whole blood and plasma mn levels and quantitative expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cell mndependent superoxide dismutase mnsod and cytosolic aminopeptidasep cappsetting and subjects in total 24 tea drinkers  or  1 l black teaday and 28 nontea drinkers were recruited from the staff and students of kings college london by circular emailresults dietary mn intakes mean range were significantly lower p  00001 in non tea drinkers 32 mgday 0565 than tea drinkers 55 mgday 212 or 10 mgday 520 depending upon the value used for mn levels of black teawhole blood plasma mn levels and expression of mnsod and capp did not differ between the groupsin a continuous analysis whole blood mn levels and expression of mnsod correlated inversely but no other parameters associated with each otherconclusions tea drinking is a major source of dietary mn and intakes commonly exceed proposed adequate intake values of 1823 mg mnday and on occasion exceed upper limits of 1011 mgdaydietary mn intake has little influence on markers of mn status or expression of mndependent enzymesfasting whole blood mn levels and leucocyte expression of mnsod could together be further investigated as markers of mn status
