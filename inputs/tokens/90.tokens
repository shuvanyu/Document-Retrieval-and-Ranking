histone deacetylases hdac control gene expression by changing histonic as well as non histonic protein conformationhdac inhibitors hdaci are considered to be among the most promising drugs for epigenetic treatment for cancerrecently a strict relationship between histone hyperacetylation in specific tissues of mouse embryos exposed to two hdaci valproic acid and trichostatin a and specific axial skeleton malformations has been demonstratedthe aim of this study is to verify if boric acid ba that induces in rodents malformations similar to those valproic acid and trichostatin arelated acts through similar mechanisms hdac inhibition and histone hyperacetylationpregnant mice were treated intraperitoneally with a teratogenic dose of ba 1000 mgkg day 8 of gestationwestern blot analysis and immunostaining were performed with anti hyperacetylated histone 4 h4 antibody on embryos explanted 1 3 or 4 h after treatment and revealed h4 hyperacetylation at the level of somiteshdac enzyme assay was performed on embryonic nuclear extractsa significant hdac inhibition activity compatible with a mixed type partial inhibition mechanism was evident with bakinetic analyses indicate that ba modifies substrate affinity by a factor alpha051 and maximum velocity by a factor beta070this work provides the first evidence for hdac inhibition by ba and suggests such a molecular mechanism for the induction of barelated malformations
