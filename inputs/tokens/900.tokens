ten healthy men ingested twice daily between meals during each of the sevenday experimental periods a citric acid as lemon juice b aloh3 or c aloh3  citric acidwhole blood sampled after each dietary period was analyzed electrothermally after digestion with nitric acidmoderate but significant increases in mean al concentrations as compared with pretreatment values 5 sd 3 micrograms of al per liter were seen after ingestion of either citric acid or aloh3 9 sd 4 and 12 sd 3 microgramsl respectivelyingestion of both aloh3 and citric acid resulted in a more pronounced highly significant p less than 0001 increase in al concentrations to 23 sd 2 micrograms all probably owing to formation and absorption of alcitrate complexes
