in the early 1970s aluminium toxicity was first implicated in the pathogenesis of clinical disorders in patients with chronic renal failure involving bone renal osteomalacia or brain tissue dialysis encephalopathybefore that time the toxic effects of aluminium ingestion were not considered to be a major concern because absorption seemed unlikely to occurmeanwhile aluminium toxicity has been investigated in countless epidemiological and clinical studies as well as in animal experiments and many papers have been published on the subjectit is now commonly acknowledged that aluminium toxicity can be induced by infusion of aluminiumcontaminated dialysis fluids by parenteral nutrition solutions and by oral exposure as a result of aluminiumcontaining pharmaceutical products such as aluminiumbased phosphate binders or antacid intakeoverthecounter antacids are the most important source for human aluminium exposure from a quantitative point of viewhowever aluminium can act as a powerful neurological toxicant and provoke embryonic and fetal toxic effects in animals and humans after gestational exposuredespite these facts the patient information leaflets from european antacids that are available otc show substantial differences regarding warnings from aluminium toxicityit seems advisable that all patients should receive the same information on aluminium toxicity from patient information leaflets in particular with regard to the increased absorption through concomitant administration with citratecontaining beverages and the use of such antacids during pregnancy
