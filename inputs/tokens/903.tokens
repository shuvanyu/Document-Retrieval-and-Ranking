total aluminum chromium copper iron manganese and nickel were determined in black tea green tea hibiscus sabdariffa and ilex paraguariensis mate by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry after nitricperchloric acid digestionin each case one ground sample of commercially available leafy material was prepared and three 05g subsamples were run in parallelthe infusions were also analyzed and the percentage of each element leached into the liquor was evaluatedthe obtained results indicated that hibiscus and mate contained lower levels of aluminum 27219 microgg and 36922 microgg respectively as referred to black tea 75931 microgg or green tea 919micro29 microgg and suggested that mate drinking could be a good dietary source of essential micronutrient manganese total content 2223110 microgg 481 leached to the infusionit was also found that the infusion of hibiscus could supply greater amounts of iron 1115 microgg total 405 leached and copper 5903 microgg total 934 leached as compared to other infusionsmoreover it was found that the percentage of element leached to the infusion was strongly related to the tannins content in the beverage correlation coefficients  082 with the exception for nickel for lower tannins level better leaching was observed
