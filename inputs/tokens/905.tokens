the effects of the chemical composition of fruit juices and fruit on the absorption of iron from a rice oryza sativa meal were measured in 234 parous indian women using the erythrocyte utilization of radioactive fe methodthe corrected geometric mean fe absorptions with different juices varied between 0040 and 0129 with the variation correlating closely with the ascorbic acid contents of the juices rs 0838 p less than 001ascorbic acid was not the only organic acid responsible for the promoting effects of citrus fruit juices on fe absorptionfe absorption from laboratory orange juice 100 ml water 33 mg ascorbic acid and 750 mg citric acid was significantly better than that from 100 ml water and 33 mg ascorbic acid alone 0097 and 0059 respectively while fe absorption from 100 ml orange juice 28 mg ascorbic acid was better than that from 100 ml water containing the same amount of ascorbic acid 0139 and 0098 respectivelyfinally fe absorption from laboratory lemon juice 100 ml orange juice and 4 g citric acid was significantly better than that from 100 ml orange juice 0226 and 0166 respectivelythe corrected geometric mean fe absorption from the rice meal was 0025several fruits had little or no effect on fe absorption from the meal 00130024these included grape vitis vinifera peach prunus persica apple malus sylvestris and avocado pear persea americanafruit with a mild to moderate enhancing effect on fe absorption 00310088 included strawberry fragaria spuncorrected values plum prunus domestica rhubarb rheum rhaponticum banana musa cavendishii mango mangifera indica pear pyrus communis cantaloup cucumis melo and pineapple ananas comosus uncorrected valuesguava psidium guajava and pawpaw carica papaya markedly increased fe absorption 01260293there was a close correlation between fe absorption and the ascorbic acid content of the fruits tested rs 0738 p less than 00001there was also a weaker but significant correlation with the citric acid content rs 055 p less than 003although this may have reflected a direct effect of citric acid on fe absorption it should be noted that fruits containing citric acid also contained ascorbic acid rs 070 p less than 0002abstract truncated at 400 words
