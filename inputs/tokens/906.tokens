the in vitro speciation of aluminium al in black tea infusion ph 48 was assessed using 3000 10000 and 30000 da cutoff ultrafilters and the effect of adding human gastric juice ph 23 and then raising the ph to 65 were also studied78 al in the tea infusion passed through the 3000da ultrafilter this percentage increased to more than 90 with the addition of gastric juice at ph 23 but then reduced to approximately 5 when the incubate was adjusted to ph 65the breakdown of teaderived polyphenols to low molecular weight phenols in vivo was measured using highresolution 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of ileostomy effluent but there was no evidence of low molecular weight breakdown products from the polyphenols of ingested tea in this effluentthese results suggest that only a small proportion of al in tea is potentially available for absorption throughout the small bowelit may be misleading to estimate systemic al absorption from tea drinking simply from total urinary aluminium excretion as has been done previously
