background in a crosssectional casecontrol study conducted in northern italy 64 former aluminium dustexposed workers were compared with 32 unexposed controls from other companies matched for age professional training economic status educational and clinical featuresthe findings lead the authors to suggest a possible role of the inhalation of aluminium dust in preclinical mild cognitive disorder which might prelude alzheimers disease ad or adlike neurological deteriorationmethods the investigation involved a standardised occupational and medical history with particular attention to exposure and symptoms assessments of neurotoxic metals in serum aluminium als copper cus and zinc zns and in blood manganese mnb lead pbb and iron febcognitive functions were assessed by the mini mental state examination mmse the clock drawing test cdt and auditory evoked eventrelated potential erpp300to detect early signs of mild cognitive impairment mci the time required to solve the mmse mmsetime and cdt cdttime was also measuredresults significantly higher internal doses of als and feb were found in the exemployees compared to the control groupthe neuropsychological tests showed a significant difference in the latency of p300 mmse score mmsetime cdt score and cdttime between the exposed and the control populationp300 latency was found to correlate positively with als and mmsetimeals has significant effects on all tests a negative relationship was observed between internal al concentrations mmse score and cdt score a positive relationship was found between internal al concentrations mmsetime and cdttimeall the potential confounders such as age height weight blood pressure schooling years alcohol coffee consumption and smoking habit were taken into accountconclusions these findings suggest a role of aluminium in early neurotoxic effects that can be detected at a preclinical stage by p300 mmse mmsetime cdttime and cdt score considering a 10 microgramsl cutoff level of serum aluminium in aluminium foundry workers with concomitant high blood levels of ironthe authors raise the question whether preclinical detection of aluminium neurotoxicity and consequent early treatment might help to prevent or retard the onset of ad or adlike pathologies
