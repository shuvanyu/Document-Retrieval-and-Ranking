purpose to measure the ph titratable acidity fluoride concentration and erosive potential of brewed teasmethods bag teas were purchased to represent black green citrus fruity and floral tea flavors from tulsi bigelow hyvee tazo and yogi brands and brewed 1 bag240 ml in boiling water for 3 minutesthe ph titratable acidity and fluoride concentrations were measuredfollowing these measurements a representative tea from each flavor was selected for investigation of erosion potentialsix extracted human molars were randomly assigned to each teateeth were painted with fingernail polish to expose a 1 x 4 mm window and then soaked in tea for a total of 25 hours with teas refreshed every 5 hoursteeth were then sectioned using a microtome and photographed using a polarized light microscopelesion depths ie eroded surfaces were measured using image pro plus softwaredifferences in physiochemical properties and lesion depths between beverages were investigated using oneway anova with posthoc tukeys hsd testrelationships among lesion depths and physiochemical properties were evaluated using the pearson correlation testresults ph titratable acidity and fluoride concentrations differed between tea flavors p  005 and between brands p  005lesion depths produced by the citrus tea 831  103 microm were greater than those produced by the fruity tea 565  61 microm both teas produced greater depths than black 301  74 microm floral 250  32 microm or green 223  63 microm teas p  005ph r  096 p  0009 was inversely and titratable acidity r  097 p  0006 was positively associated with lesion depths
