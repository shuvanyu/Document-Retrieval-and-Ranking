response surface methodology was used to investigate the effect and interactions of processing variables such as roselle extract 0113 soybean oil 520 on physicochemical textural and sensory properties of cooked pork pattiesit was found that reduction in thickness ph l and b values decreased however waterholding capacity reduction in diameter and a values increased respectively as the amount of roselle increasedsoybean oil addition increased waterholding capacity reduction in thickness b values of the pattiesthe hardness depended on the roselle and soybean oil added as its linear effect was negative at p001the preference of color tenderness juiciness and overall quality depend on the addition of roselle and soybean oilthe maximum overall quality score 542 was observed when 125 g of soybean oil and 07 g of roselle extract was addedthe results of this optimization study would be useful for meat industry that tends to increase the product yield for patties using the optimum levels of ingredients by rsmcopyright  2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
