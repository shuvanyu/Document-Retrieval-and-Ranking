background the main 6month results from the premier trial showed that comprehensive behavioral intervention programs improve lifestyle behaviors and lower blood pressureobjective to compare the 18month effects of 2 multicomponent behavioral interventions versus advice only on hypertension status lifestyle changes and blood pressuredesign multicenter 3arm randomized trial conducted from january 2000 through november 2002setting 4 clinical centers and a coordinating centerpatients 810 adult volunteers with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension systolic blood pressure 120 to 159 mm hg diastolic blood pressure 80 to 95 mm hginterventions a multicomponent behavioral intervention that implemented longestablished recommendations established a multicomponent behavioral intervention that implemented the established recommendations plus the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash diet established plus dash and advice onlymeasurements lifestyle variables and blood pressure statusfollowup for blood pressure measurement at 18 months was 94results compared with advice only both behavioral interventions statistically significantly reduced weight fat intake and sodium intakethe established plus dash intervention also statistically significantly increased fruit vegetable dairy fiber and mineral intakesrelative to the advice only group the odds ratios for hypertension at 18 months were 083 95 ci 067 to 104 for the established group and 077 ci 062 to 097 for the established plus dash groupalthough reductions in absolute blood pressure at 18 months were greater for participants in the established and the established plus dash groups than for the advice only group the differences were not statistically significantlimitations the exclusion criteria and the volunteer nature of this cohort may limit generalizabilityalthough blood pressure is a wellaccepted risk factor for cardiovascular disease the authors were not able to assess intervention effects on clinical cardiovascular events in this limited time and with this sample sizeconclusions over 18 months persons with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension can sustain multiple lifestyle modifications that improve control of blood pressure and could reduce the risk for chronic disease
