background  aims increasing evidence suggests that a low folate intake and impaired folate metabolism may be implicated in the development of gastrointestinal cancerswe conducted a systematic review with metaanalysis of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association of folate intake or genetic polymorphisms in 510methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mthfr a central enzyme in folate metabolism with risk of esophageal gastric or pancreatic cancermethods a literature search was performed using medline for studies published through march 2006studyspecific relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variance to obtain randomeffects summary estimatesresults the summary relative risks for the highest versus the lowest category of dietary folate intake were 066 95 confidence interval ci 053083 for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 4 casecontrol 050 95 ci 039065 for esophageal adenocarcinoma 3 casecontrol and 049 95 ci 035067 for pancreatic cancer 1 casecontrol 4 cohort there was no heterogeneity among studiesresults on dietary folate intake and risk of gastric cancer 9 casecontrol 2 cohort were inconsistentin most studies the mthfr 677tt variant genotype which is associated with reduced enzyme activity was associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma gastric cardia adenocarcinoma noncardia gastric cancer gastric cancer all subsites and pancreatic cancer all but one of 22 odds ratios were 1 of which 13 estimates were statistically significantstudies of the mthfr a1298c polymorphism were limited and inconsistentconclusions these findings support the hypothesis that folate may play a role in carcinogenesis of the esophagus stomach and pancreas
