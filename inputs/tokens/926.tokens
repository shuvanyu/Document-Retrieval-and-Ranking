in order to compare the antihypertensive effectiveness and tolerability of a standardized extract from hibiscus sabdariffa with captopril a controlled and randomized clinical trial was donepatients from 30 to 80 years old with diagnosed hypertension and without antihypertensive treatment for at least 1 month before were includedthe experimental procedure consisted of the administration of an infusion prepared with 10 g of dry calyx from h sabdariffa on 051 water 96 mg anthocyanins content daily before breakfast or captopril 25 mg twice a day for 4 weeksthe outcome variables were tolerability therapeutic effectiveness diastolic reduction  or  10 mm hg and in the experimental group urinary electrolytes modificationninety subjects were included 15 withdrew from the study due to nonmedical reasons so the analysis included 39 and 36 patients from the experimental and control group respectivelythe results showed that h sabdariffa was able to decrease the systolic blood pressure bp from 13905 to 12373mm hg anova p  003 and the diastolic bp from 9081 to 7952mm hg anova p  006at the end of the study there were no significant differences between the bp detected in both treatment groups anova p  025the rates of therapeutic effectiveness were 07895 and 08438 with h sabdariffa and captopril respectively chi2 p  0560 whilst the tolerability was 100 for both treatmentsa natriuretic effect was observed with the experimental treatmentthe obtained data confirm that the h sabdariffa extract standardized on 96mg of total anthocyanins and captopril 50 mgday did not show significant differences relative to hypotensive effect antihypertensive effectiveness and tolerability
