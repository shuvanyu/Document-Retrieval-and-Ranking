research finding on the composition of macronutrient intakes on body weight has not been consistentfurthermore little research has examined the impact of subcomponents of macronutrients such as saturated fat or plant protein on body weightthe purpose of this report was to examine the impact of saturated fat animal and plant protein and other macronutrient intakes at the end of an intensive intervention on subsequent followup body weightthis is a secondary observational data analysis using data from premier an 18month randomized clinical trial that enrolled a total of 810 participantsparticipants completed group and individual sessions designed to help them improve blood pressure bp control by making lifestyle changesdietary intakes were assessed by two 24h diet recalls at baseline 6 and 18 monthsbody weight and physical fitness were monitored regularlyregression models were used to examine the impact of animal or plant protein and other macronutrient intakes on subsequent body weightafter controlling for potential confounders none of the caloriecontributing nutrient intakes at baseline was associated with subsequent weight at 6 or 18 monthshowever a greater intake of saturated fat at 6 months was associated with higher weight at 18 months p  0002a greater intake of plant protein at 6 month was marginally associated with lower absolute weight at 18 month p  0069we conclude that macronutrient intakes before the intervention were not associated with subsequent body weight at 6 or 18 monthshowever a lower saturated fat intake achieved after 6month intervention predicts a lower body weight at 18 months and thus greater weightloss maintenance
