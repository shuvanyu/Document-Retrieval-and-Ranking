it is likely that plant food consumption throughout much of human evolution shaped the dietary requirements of contemporary humansdiets would have been high in dietary fiber vegetable protein plant sterols and associated phytochemicals and low in saturated and transfatty acids and other substrates for cholesterol biosynthesisto meet the bodys needs for cholesterol we believe genetic differences and polymorphisms were conserved by evolution which tended to raise serum cholesterol levelsas a result modern man with a radically different diet and lifestyle especially in middle age is now recommended to take medications to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseaseexperimental introduction of high intakes of viscous fibers vegetable proteins and plant sterols in the form of a possible myocene diet of leafy vegetables fruit and nuts lowered serum ldlcholesterol in healthy volunteers by over 30 equivalent to first generation statins the standard cholesterollowering medicationsfurthermore supplementation of a modern therapeutic diet in hyperlipidemic subjects with the same components taken as oat barley and psyllium for viscous fibers soy and almonds for vegetable proteins and plant sterolenriched margarine produced similar reductions in ldlcholesterol as the myocenelike diet and reduced the majority of subjects blood lipids concentrations into the normal rangewe conclude that reintroduction of plant food components which would have been present in large quantities in the plant based diets eaten throughout most of human evolution into modern diets can correct the lipid abnormalities associated with contemporary eating patterns and reduce the need for pharmacological interventions
