barretts oesophagus normally affects the distal oesophagus when metaplastic columnar lined epithelium replaces stratified squamous epithelium which predisposes to cancer developmentthis develops as a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux gordthose with barretts have a 40 fold increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma 1there are is still a lack of understanding of the natural history of the cell of originthis does hamper research into this areawe accept that there is a limitation in testing of the pathogenesis of barretts oesophagus due to a lack of a universally accepted animal modelthe major questions surrounding barretts oesophagus include validity of surveillance strategies the optimal treatment and more importantly an agent that can prevent progression to cancer without unacceptable side effectsthe main chemopreventative agents that show promise are aspirin and proton pump inhibitors ppisthere are other agents such as green tea berries and antioxidants and diet that have been suggested we discuss the evidence available for these strategieswe hope for continued improvement in the clinical trial infrastructure to facilitate testing of new pharmacological and endoscopic interventions for barretts oesophaguscopyright  2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
