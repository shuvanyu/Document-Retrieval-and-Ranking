background high wholegrain intake has been reportedly associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes t2d which is an effect possibly subject to genetic effect modificationconfirmation in prospective studies and investigations on the impact on prediabetes is neededobjectives in a prospective populationbased study we investigated whether a higher intake of whole grain protects against the development of prediabetes and t2d and tested for modulation by polymorphisms of the tcf7l2 genedesign we examined the 810y incidence of prediabetes impaired glucose tolerance impaired fasting glucose or the combination of both and t2d in relation to the intake of whole grainbaseline data were available for 3180 women and 2297 men aged 3556 yresults a higher intake of whole grain 591 compared with 306 gd was associated with a 34 lower risk to deteriorate in glucose tolerance to prediabetes or t2d women and men combinedthe association remained after adjustments for age family history of diabetes bmi physical activity smoking education and blood pressure or 078 95 ci 063 096risk reduction was significant in men or 065 95 ci 049 085 but not in womenassociations were significant for prediabetes per se all or 073 95 ci 056 094 men or 057 95 ci 040 080the intake of whole grain correlated inversely with insulin resistance homairthe impact of wholegrain intake was undetectable in men who harbored diabetogenic polymorphisms of the tcf7l2 geneconclusions a higher intake of whole grain is associated with decreased risk of deteriorating glucose tolerance including progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes by mechanisms likely tied to effects on insulin sensitivityeffect modifications by tcf7l2 genetic polymorphisms are supported
