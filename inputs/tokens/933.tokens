legumes are the bas√©s diet in several countriesthey hold a high nutritional value but other properties related to human health are nowadays being studiedthe aim of this work was to study the influence of processes boiling or germination on the phenolic composition of dark beans phaseolus vulgaris l cv tolosana and their effect on their antioxidant neuroprotective and anticancer abilityphenolic composition of raw and processed dark beans was analysed by hplcpad and hplcesimsthe antioxidant activity was evaluated by oracastrocytes cultures u373 have been used to test their neuroprotective effectanticancer activities were evaluated on three different cell lines renal adenocarcinoma tk10 breast adenocarcinoma mcf7 and melanoma uacc62 by sulphorhodamine b methodqualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic composition have been observed between raw and processed dark beans that influence the antioxidant activity mainly for germinated samples which show a decrease of antioxidant capacityalthough every assayed extracts decreased reactive oxygen species release and exhibited cytotoxicity activities on cancer cell lines raw beans proved to be the most active in neuroprotective and antitumoral effects this sample is especially rich in phenolic compounds mainly anthocyaninsthis study further demonstrated that phenolic composition of dark beans is related with cooking process and so with their neuroprotective and anticancer activity cooking of dark beans improves their digestion and absorption at intestinal level while maintaining its protective ability on oxidative process at cellular levelcopyright  2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
