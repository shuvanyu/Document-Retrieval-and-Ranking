background changes in conventional lipid risk factors with gemfibrozil treatment only partially explain the reductions in coronary heart disease chd events experienced by men in the veterans affairs highdensity lipoprotein intervention trial vahitwe examined whether measurement of lowdensity lipoprotein ldl and highdensity lipoprotein hdl particle subclasses provides additional information relative to chd risk reductionmethods and results this is a prospective nested casecontrol study of 364 men with a new chd event nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death during a 51year median followup and 697 agematched controlsnuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy was used to quantify levels of ldl and hdl particle subclasses and mean particle sizes in plasma obtained at baseline and after 7 months of treatment with gemfibrozil or placeboodds ratios for a 1sd increment of each lipoprotein variable were calculated with adjusted logistic regression modelsgemfibrozil treatment increased ldl size and lowered numbers of ldl particles 5 while raising numbers of hdl particles 10 and small hdl subclass particles 21concentrations of these ldl and hdl particles achieved with gemfibrozil were significant independent predictors of new chd eventsfor total ldl and hdl particles odds ratios predicting chd benefit were 128 95 ci 112 to 147 and 071 95 ci 061 to 081 respectivelymean ldl and hdl particle sizes were not associated with chd eventsconclusions the effects of gemfibrozil on nmrmeasured ldl and hdl particle subclasses which are not reflected by conventional lipoprotein cholesterol measures help to explain the demonstrated benefit of this therapy in patients with low hdl cholesterol
