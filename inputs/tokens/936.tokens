we previously evaluated the responses to dietary cholesterol in children and young adultsin this study the effects of dietary cholesterol on plasma lipids and ldl atherogenicity were evaluated in 42 elderly subjects 29 postmenopausal women and 13 men  60 y oldour exclusion criteria were diabetes heart disease and the use of reductase inhibitorsthe study followed a randomized crossover design in which subjects were assigned to consume the equivalent of 3 large eggs egg daily or the same amount of a cholesterolfree fatfree egg substitute sub for a 1mo periodafter a 3wk washout period subjects were assigned to the alternate treatmentthe concentration of plasma cholesterol after the egg period varied among subjectswhen all subjects were evaluated there were significant increases in ldl cholesterol ldlc p  005 and hdlc p  0001 for both men and women during the egg period resulting in no alterations in the ldlchdlc or the total cholesterolhdlc ratiosin addition the ldl peak diameter was increased during the egg period for all subjectsin contrast the measured parameters of ldl oxidation conjugated diene formation and ldl lag time did not differ between the egg and the sub periodswe conclude from this study that dietary cholesterol provided by eggs does not increase the risk for heart disease in a healthy elderly population
