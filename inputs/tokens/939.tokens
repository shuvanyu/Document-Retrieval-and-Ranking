some practitioners use advanced lipoprotein analysis with the goal of better predicting risk and individualizing lifestyle and drug therapy for cardiovascular preventionunfortunately lowdensity lipoprotein ldl and highdensity lipoprotein hdl particle number and size other lipoprotein subfractionation apolipoproteins b and a and lipoproteina have not yet met current standards for biomarker evaluation and it remains to be determined whether these tests incrementally add to cardiovascular risk predicted by traditional risk factorsmore importantly it has yet to be determined whether treatment strategies guided by or targeting these measures improve cardiovascular outcomesdrug therapies known to alter advanced lipoprotein analysis parameters specifically niacin and fenofibrate have not been shown to additionally reduce cardiovascular risk in recent randomized trials of highrisk patients treated with statin therapythese findings suggest advanced lipoprotein analysisguided strategies may not further reduce cardiovascular events and could lead to increased adverse effects and costs this approach needs further research to establish its role in individualizing therapies for cardiovascular preventionin contrast a large body of evidence supports focusing on ldl cholesterol reduction and intensification of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular riskcopyright  2012 american college of cardiology foundationpublished by elsevier inc all rights reserved
