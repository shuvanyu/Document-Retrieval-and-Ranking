the relation between various types of fiber and oral pharyngeal and esophageal cancer was investigated using data from a casecontrol study conducted between 1992 and 1997 in italycases were 271 hospital patients with incident histologically confirmed oral cancer 327 with pharyngeal cancer and 304 with esophageal cancercontrols were 1950 subjects admitted to the same network of hospitals as the cases for acute nonneoplastic diseasescases and controls were interviewed during their hospital stay using a validated food frequency questionnaireodds ratios or were computed after allowance for age sex and other potential confounding factors including alcohol tobacco consumption and energy intakethe ors for the highest vs the lowest quintile of intake of oral pharyngeal and esophageal cancer combined were 040 for total englyst fiber 037 for soluble fiber 052 for cellulose 048 for insoluble non cellulose polysaccharide 033 for total insoluble fiber and 038 for ligninthe inverse relation were similar for vegetable fiber or  051 fruit fiber or  060 and grain fiber or  056 and were somewhat stronger for oral and pharyngeal cancer than for esophageal cancerthe ors were similar for the two sexes and strata of age education alcohol and tobacco consumption and total nonalcohol energy intakeour study indicates that fiber intake may have a protective role on oral pharyngeal and esophageal cancer
