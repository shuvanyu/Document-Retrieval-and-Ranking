background recent studies in animals have shown a mechanistic link between intestinal microbial metabolism of the choline moiety in dietary phosphatidylcholine lecithin and coronary artery disease through the production of a proatherosclerotic metabolite trimethylaminenoxide tmaowe investigated the relationship among intestinal microbiotadependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine tmao levels and adverse cardiovascular events in humansmethods we quantified plasma and urinary levels of tmao and plasma choline and betaine levels by means of liquid chromatography and online tandem mass spectrometry after a phosphatidylcholine challenge ingestion of two hardboiled eggs and deuterium d9labeled phosphatidylcholine in healthy participants before and after the suppression of intestinal microbiota with oral broadspectrum antibioticswe further examined the relationship between fasting plasma levels of tmao and incident major adverse cardiovascular events death myocardial infarction or stroke during 3 years of followup in 4007 patients undergoing elective coronary angiographyresults timedependent increases in levels of both tmao and its d9 isotopologue as well as other choline metabolites were detected after the phosphatidylcholine challengeplasma levels of tmao were markedly suppressed after the administration of antibiotics and then reappeared after withdrawal of antibioticsincreased plasma levels of tmao were associated with an increased risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event hazard ratio for highest vs lowest tmao quartile 254 95 confidence interval 196 to 328 p0001an elevated tmao level predicted an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors p0001 as well as in lowerrisk subgroupsconclusions the production of tmao from dietary phosphatidylcholine is dependent on metabolism by the intestinal microbiotaincreased tmao levels are associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular eventsfunded by the national institutes of health and others
