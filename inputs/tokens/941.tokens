consumption of eggs for a long period was shown to result in hypercholesterolemia and is generally restricted for this reasonin the present study we analyzed the effect of eggs consumption for 3 weeks on lipoprotein atherogenicityconsumption of 2 eggs per day with the meals for 3 weeks resulted in a minor elevation in plasma glucose and urea concentrationsplasma cholesterol concentration increased by 11 p  005 as a result of increased plasma lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levelsplasma triglycerides decreased by 13 p  001 but there were no significant alterations in plasma apolipoproteins ai or b100 concentrationsplasma highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol decreased by 11 p  005there was a 13 reduction though not significant in the cholesterol efflux from j774 a1 macrophages by hdl that was derived after eggs consumption in comparison to hdl that was obtained at baselinethe susceptibility of plasma using 100 mm of 22 azobis 2amidinopropane aaph as well as that of ldl using 10 microm of copper ions to lipid peroxidation was increased by 42 and 34 respectively as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance tbars assay p  001kinetic analysis of ldl oxidation by copper ions revealed a 37 reduction in the lag time required for the initiation of ldl oxidation after 3 weeks of eggs consumptionthe total plasma fatty acids concentration increased from 22  05 to 32  06 mgmlthe plasma antioxidants vitamin e and carotenoids were not significantly affected by eggs consumptionwe conclude that eggs consumption in addition to its hypercholesterolemic effect increases plasma and ldl oxidizability a phenomenon which was shown to enhance the progression of atherosclerosisthe atherogenic properties may contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis prevalent in populations with high cholesterol intake
