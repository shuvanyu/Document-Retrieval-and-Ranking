how can adverse experiences in early life such as maltreatment exert such powerful negative effects on health decades laterthe answer may lie in changes to dnanew research suggests that exposure to stress can accelerate the erosion of dna segments called telomeresshorter telomere length correlates with chronological age and also disease morbidity and mortalitythus telomere erosion is a potential mechanism linking childhood stress to health problems later in lifehowever an array of mechanistic methodological and basic biological questions must be addressed in order to translate telomere discoveries into clinical applications for monitoring health and predicting disease riskthis paper covers the current state of the science and lays out new research directions
