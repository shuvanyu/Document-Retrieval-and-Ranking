background psychological stress is suggested to accelerate the rate of biological agingwe investigated whether workrelated exhaustion an indicator of prolonged work stress is associated with accelerated biological aging as indicated by shorter leukocyte telomeres that is the dnaprotein complexes that cap chromosomal ends in cellsmethods we used data from a representative sample of the finnish workingage population the health 2000 studyour sample consisted of 2911 men and women aged 3064workrelated exhaustion was assessed using the maslach burnout inventory  general surveywe determined relative leukocyte telomere length using a quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction pcr based methodresults after adjustment for age and sex individuals with severe exhaustion had leukocyte telomeres on average 0043 relative units shorter standard error of the mean 0016 than those with no exhaustion p  0009the association between exhaustion and relative telomere length remained significant after additional adjustment for marital and socioeconomic status smoking body mass index and morbidities adjusted difference 0044 relative units standard error of the mean 0017 p  0008conclusions these data suggest that workrelated exhaustion is related to the acceleration of the rate of biological agingthis hypothesis awaits confirmation in a prospective study measuring changes in relative telomere length over time
