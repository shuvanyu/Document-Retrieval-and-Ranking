background telomerase activity is a predictor of longterm cellular viability which decreases with chronic psychological distress epel et al 2004buddhist traditions claim that meditation decreases psychological distress and promotes wellbeing eg dalai lama and cutler 2009therefore we investigated the effects of a 3month meditation retreat on telomerase activity and two major contributors to the experience of stress perceived control associated with decreased stress and neuroticism associated with increased subjective distresswe used mediation models to test whether changes in perceived control and neuroticism explained meditation retreat effects on telomerase activityin addition we investigated whether two qualities developed by meditative practice increased mindfulness and purpose in life accounted for retreatrelated changes in the two stressrelated variables and in telomerase activitymethods retreat participants n30 meditated for 6 h daily for 3 months and were compared with a waitlist control group n30 matched for age sex body mass index and prior meditation experienceretreat participants received instruction in concentrative meditation techniques and complementary practices used to cultivate benevolent states of mind wallace 2006psychological measures were assessed pre and postretreatperipheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected postretreat for telomerase activitybecause there were clear a priori hypotheses 1tailed significance criteria were used throughoutresults telomerase activity was significantly greater in retreat participants than in controls at the end of the retreat p005increases in perceived control decreases in neuroticism and increases in both mindfulness and purpose in life were greater in the retreat group p001mediation analyses indicated that the effect of the retreat on telomerase was mediated by increased perceived control and decreased neuroticismin turn changes in perceived control and neuroticism were both partially mediated by increased mindfulness and purpose in lifeadditionally increases in purpose in life directly mediated the telomerase group difference whereas increases in mindfulness did notconclusions this is the first study to link meditation and positive psychological change with telomerase activityalthough we did not measure baseline telomerase activity the data suggest that increases in perceived control and decreases in negative affectivity contributed to an increase in telomerase activity with implications for telomere length and immune cell longevityfurther purpose in life is influenced by meditative practice and directly affects both perceived control and negative emotionality affecting telomerase activity directly as well as indirectlycopyright  2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
