telomerases constitute a group of specialized ribonucleoprotein enzymes that remediate chromosomal shrinkage resulting from the endreplication problemdefects in telomere length regulation are associated with several diseases as well as with aging and cancerdespite significant progress in understanding the roles of telomerase the complete structure of the human telomerase enzyme bound to telomeric dna remains elusive with the detailed molecular mechanism of telomere elongation still unknownby application of computational methods for distant homology detection comparative modeling and molecular docking guided by available experimental data we have generated a threedimensional structural model of a partial telomerase elongation complex composed of three essential protein domains bound to a singlestranded telomeric dna sequence in the form of a heteroduplex with the template region of the human rna subunit terthis model provides a structural mechanism for the processivity of telomerase and offers new insights into elongationwe conclude that the rnadna heteroduplex is constrained by the telomerase ten domain through repeated extension cycles and that the ten domain controls the process by moving the template ahead one base at a time by translation and rotation of the double helixthe rna region directly following the template can bind complementarily to the newly synthesized telomeric dna while the template itself is reused in the telomerase active site during the next reaction cyclethis first structural model of the human telomerase enzyme provides many details of the molecular mechanism of telomerase and immediately provides an important target for rational drug design
