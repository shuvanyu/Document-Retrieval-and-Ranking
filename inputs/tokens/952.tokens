relatively short telomere length may serve as a marker of accelerated aging and shorter telomeres have been linked to chronic stressspecific lifestyle behaviors that can mitigate the effects of stress might be associated with longer telomere lengthsprevious research suggests a link between behaviors that focus on the wellbeing of others such as volunteering and caregiving and overall health and longevitywe examined relative telomere length in a group of individuals experienced in lovingkindness meditation lkm a practice derived from the buddhist tradition which utilizes a focus on unselfish kindness and warmth towards all people and control participants who had done no meditationblood was collected by venipuncture and genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytesquantitative real time pcr was used to measure relative telomere length rtl cawthon 2002 in fifteen lkm practitioners and 22 control participantsthere were no significant differences in age gender race education or exposure to trauma but the control group had a higher mean body mass index bmi and lower rates of past depressionthe lkm practitioners had longer rtl than controls at the trend level p083 among women the lkm practitioners had significantly longer rtl than controls p007 which remained significant even after controlling for bmi and past depressionalthough limited by small sample size these results offer the intriguing possibility that lkm practice especially in women might alter rtl a biomarker associated with longevitycopyright  2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
