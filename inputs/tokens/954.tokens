objective it has been reported that women benefit from the maintenance of telomere length by estrogenexercise may favorably influence telomere length although results are inconsistent regarding the duration and type of exercise and the cell type used to measure telomere lengththe purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between habitual physical exercise and telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs in postmenopausal womenpostmenopausal women were chosen as study participants because they are typically estrogen deficientmethods this experimentalcontrol crosssectional study included 44 healthy nondiabetic nonsmoking postmenopausal womenhabitual exercisers and sedentary participants were matched for age and body mass indexbody weight height blood pressure and waist and hip circumference were measuredmitochondrial dna copy number and telomere length in pbmcs were determined and biochemical tests were performedhabitual physical exercise was defined as combined aerobic and resistance exercise performed for at least 60 minutes per session more than three times a week for more than 12 monthsresults the mean age of all participants was 5811  684 years and participants in the habitual exercise group had been exercising more than three times per week for an average of 1923  515 monthsserum triglyceride levels p  001 fasting insulin concentrations p  001 and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance p  001 were significantly lower and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels p  001 circulating adiponectin p  001 mitochondrial dna copy number p  001 and telomere length p  001 were significantly higher in the habitual exercise group than in the sedentary groupin a stepwise multiple regression analysis habitual exercise β  0522 p  001 and adiponectin levels β  0139 p  003 were the independent factors associated with the telomere length of pbmcs in postmenopausal womenconclusions habitual physical exercise is associated with greater telomere length in postmenopausal womenthis finding suggests that habitual physical exercise in postmenopausal women may reduce telomere attrition
