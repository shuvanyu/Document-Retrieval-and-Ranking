backgroundobjectives shorter leukocyte telomere length ltl is associated with several chronic diseases but only a few studies have assessed the association between dietary factors and ltlour objective was to study the association between fats fruits vegetables and ltl in a crosssectional study designwe hypothesized that intakes of fruits and vegetables would be positively associated with ltl and that intakes of fats and especially saturated fatty acids sfas would be negatively associated with ltlsubjectsmethods ltl was measured by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction in 1942 men and women aged 5770 years from the helsinki birth cohort studywe assessed the whole diet by a validated semiquantitative 128item foodfrequency questionnaireresults in general there were only a few significant resultshowever total fat and sfa intake p004 and 001 respectively were inversely associated with ltl in men adjusting for age and energy intakein women vegetable intake was positively associated with ltl p005men consuming the most butter and least fruits had significantly shorter telomeres than those consuming the lowest amounts of butter and highest amounts of fruits p005we found no association between ltl and body mass index waisthip ratio smoking physical activity or educational attainmentconclusions in this crosssectional study of elderly men and women there were only a few statistically significant effects of diet but in general they support the hypothesis that fat and vegetable intakes were associated with ltl
