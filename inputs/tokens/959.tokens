there is increasing interest in discovering mechanisms that mediate the effects of childhood stress on latelife disease morbidity and mortalityprevious studies have suggested one potential mechanism linking stress to cellular aging disease and mortality in humans telomere erosionwe examined telomere erosion in relation to childrens exposure to violence a salient earlylife stressor which has known longterm consequences for wellbeing and is a major publichealth and socialwelfare problemin the first prospectivelongitudinal study with repeated telomere measurements in children while they experienced stress we tested the hypothesis that childhood violence exposure would accelerate telomere erosion from age 5 to age 10 yearsviolence was assessed as exposure to maternal domestic violence frequent bullying victimization and physical maltreatment by an adultparticipants were 236 children 49 females 42 with one or more violence exposures recruited from the environmentalrisk longitudinal twin study a nationally representative 19941995 birth cohorteach childs mean relative telomere length was measured simultaneously in baseline and followup dna samples using the quantitative pcr method for ts ratio the ratio of telomere repeat copy numbers to singlecopy gene numberscompared with their counterparts the children who experienced two or more kinds of violence exposure showed significantly more telomere erosion between age5 baseline and age10 followup measurements even after adjusting for sex socioeconomic status and body mass index b  0052 se 0021 p  0015this finding provides support for a mechanism linking cumulative childhood stress to telomere maintenance observed already at a young age with potential impact for lifelong health
