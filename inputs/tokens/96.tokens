introduction ingestion of a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can cause cerebral air gas embolism cagehyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot is the standard of care in the treatment of cagewe report a case of cage after accidental ingestion of 33hydrogen peroxide treated with hbot resulting in reversal of both the clinical and radiologic abnormalitiescase report a 48 yearold male took two sips of 33 hydrogen peroxidea short time later he developed hematemesis left sided hemiplegia confusion and left homonymous hemianopsiainitial laboratory studies chest xray and brain ct were normalmri demonstrated areas of restricted diffusion and t2 hyper intensities in multiple vascular territories consistent with ischemia due to cageeighteen hours after arrival the patient underwent hbot at 3 atmospheres absolute ata for 30 minutes and 25 ata for 60 minutes with clinical improvementfollowup mri at six months demonstrated resolution of the hyper intensitiesdiscussion a search of medline from 1950 to present revealed only two cases of cage from ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide treated with hbotboth cases similar to ours had complete resolution of symptomsof the seven reported cases of cage from hydrogen peroxide that did not undergo hbot only in one patient was there a report of symptom resolutionconclusion ingestion of even a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can result in cerebral air gas embolismhyperbaric oxygen therapy may be of benefit in reversing the symptoms and preventing permanent neurological impairment
