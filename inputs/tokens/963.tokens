background the underlying molecular mechanisms of the vasculoprotective effects of physical exercise are incompletely understoodtelomere erosion is a central component of aging and telomereassociated proteins regulate cellular senescence and survivalthis study examines the effects of exercising on vascular telomere biology and endothelial apoptosis in mice and the effects of longterm endurance training on telomere biology in humansmethods and results c57bl6 mice were randomized to voluntary running or no running wheel conditions for 3 weeksexercise upregulated telomerase activity in the thoracic aorta and in circulating mononuclear cells compared with sedentary controls increased vascular expression of telomere repeatbinding factor 2 and ku70 and reduced the expression of vascular apoptosis regulators such as cellcyclecheckpoint kinase 2 p16 and p53mice preconditioned by voluntary running exhibited a marked reduction in lipopolysaccharideinduced aortic endothelial apoptosistransgenic mouse studies showed that endothelial nitric oxide synthase and telomerase reverse transcriptase synergize to confer endothelial stress resistance after physical activityto test the significance of these data in humans telomere biology in circulating leukocytes of young and middleaged track and field athletes was analyzedperipheral blood leukocytes isolated from endurance athletes showed increased telomerase activity expression of telomerestabilizing proteins and downregulation of cellcycle inhibitors compared with untrained individualslongterm endurance training was associated with reduced leukocyte telomere erosion compared with untrained controlsconclusions physical activity regulates telomerestabilizing proteins in mice and in humans and thereby protects from stressinduced vascular apoptosis
