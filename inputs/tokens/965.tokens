introduction curcumin is a polyphenolic compound derived from the plant curcuma long lin that has been demonstrated to have antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects as well as effects on reducing betaamyloid aggregationit reduces pathology in transgenic models of alzheimers disease ad and is a promising candidate for treating human adthe purpose of the current study is to generate tolerability and preliminary clinical and biomarker efficacy data on curcumin in persons with admethods we performed a 24week randomized double blind placebocontrolled study of curcumin c3 complex with an openlabel extension to 48 weeksthirtysix persons with mildtomoderate ad were randomized to receive placebo 2 gramsday or 4 gramsday of oral curcumin for 24 weeksfor weeks 24 through 48 subjects that were receiving curcumin continued with the same dose while subjects previously receiving placebo were randomized in a 11 ratio to 2 gramsday or 4 gramsdaythe primary outcome measures were incidence of adverse events changes in clinical laboratory tests and the alzheimers disease assessment scale  cognitive subscale adascog at 24 weeks in those completing the studysecondary outcome measures included the neuropsychiatric inventory npi the alzheimers disease cooperative study  activities of daily living adcsadl scale levels of aβ140 and aβ142 in plasma and levels of aβ142 ttau ptau181 and f2isoprostanes in cerebrospinal fluidplasma levels of curcumin and its metabolites up to four hours after drug administration were also measuredresults mean age of completers n  30 was 735 years and mean minimental status examination mmse score was 225one subject withdrew in the placebo 8 worsened memory and 524 subjects withdrew in the curcumin group 21 3 due to gastrointestinal symptomscurcumin c3 complex was associated with lowered hematocrit and increased glucose levels that were clinically insignificantthere were no differences between treatment groups in clinical or biomarker efficacy measuresthe levels of native curcumin measured in plasma were low 732 ngmlconclusions curcumin was generally welltolerated although three subjects on curcumin withdrew due to gastrointestinal symptomswe were unable to demonstrate clinical or biochemical evidence of efficacy of curcumin c3 complex in ad in this 24week placebocontrolled trial although preliminary data suggest limited bioavailability of this compoundtrial registration clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct00099710
