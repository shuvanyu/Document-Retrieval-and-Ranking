treatment of alzheimers disease ad is difficult due to ignorance of its pathogenesisad patients have defects in phagocytosis of amyloidbeta 142 abeta in vitro by the innate immune cells monocytemacrophages and in clearance of abeta plaques 5the natural product curcuminoids enhanced brain clearance of abeta in animal modelswe therefore treated macrophages of six ad patients and 3 controls by curcuminoids in vitro and measured abeta uptake using fluorescence and confocal microscopyat baseline the intensity of abeta uptake by ad macrophages was significantly lower in comparison to control macrophages and involved surface binding but no intracellular uptakeafter treatment of macrophages with curcuminoids abeta uptake by macrophages of three of the six ad patients was significantly p0001 to 0081 increasedconfocal microscopy of ad macrophages responsive to curcuminoids showed surface binding in untreated macrophages but colocalization with phalloidin in an intracellular compartment after treatmentimmunomodulation of the innate immune system by curcuminoids might be a safe approach to immune clearance of amyloidosis in ad brain
