hydrogen peroxide is an oxidising agent that is used in a number of household products including generalpurpose disinfectants chlorinefree bleaches fabric stain removers contact lens disinfectants and hair dyes and it is a component of some tooth whitening productsin industry the principal use of hydrogen peroxide is as a bleaching agent in the manufacture of paper and pulphydrogen peroxide has been employed medicinally for wound irrigation and for the sterilisation of ophthalmic and endoscopic instrumentshydrogen peroxide causes toxicity via three main mechanisms corrosive damage oxygen gas formation and lipid peroxidationconcentrated hydrogen peroxide is caustic and exposure may result in local tissue damageingestion of concentrated 35 hydrogen peroxide can also result in the generation of substantial volumes of oxygenwhere the amount of oxygen evolved exceeds its maximum solubility in blood venous or arterial gas embolism may occurthe mechanism of cns damage is thought to be arterial gas embolisation with subsequent brain infarctionrapid generation of oxygen in closed body cavities can also cause mechanical distension and there is potential for the rupture of the hollow viscus secondary to oxygen liberationin addition intravascular foaming following absorption can seriously impede right ventricular output and produce complete loss of cardiac outputhydrogen peroxide can also exert a direct cytotoxic effect via lipid peroxidationingestion of hydrogen peroxide may cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract with nausea vomiting haematemesis and foaming at the mouth the foam may obstruct the respiratory tract or result in pulmonary aspirationpainful gastric distension and belching may be caused by the liberation of large volumes of oxygen in the stomachblistering of the mucosae and oropharyngeal burns are common following ingestion of concentrated solutions and laryngospasm and haemorrhagic gastritis have been reportedsinus tachycardia lethargy confusion coma convulsions stridor subepiglottic narrowing apnoea cyanosis and cardiorespiratory arrest may ensue within minutes of ingestionoxygen gas embolism may produce multiple cerebral infarctionsalthough most inhalational exposures cause little more than coughing and transient dyspnoea inhalation of highly concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide can cause severe irritation and inflammation of mucous membranes with coughing and dyspnoeashock coma and convulsions may ensue and pulmonary oedema may occur up to 2472 hours post exposuresevere toxicity has resulted from the use of hydrogen peroxide solutions to irrigate wounds within closed body cavities or under pressure as oxygen gas embolism has resultedinflammation blistering and severe skin damage may follow dermal contactocular exposure to 3 solutions may cause immediate stinging irritation lacrimation and blurred vision but severe injury is unlikelyexposure to more concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions 10 may result in ulceration or perforation of the corneagut decontamination is not indicated following ingestion due to the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase to oxygen and waterif gastric distension is painful a gastric tube should be passed to release gasearly aggressive airway management is critical in patients who have ingested concentrated hydrogen peroxide as respiratory failure and arrest appear to be the proximate cause of deathendoscopy should be considered if there is persistent vomiting haematemesis significant oral burns severe abdominal pain dysphagia or stridorcorticosteroids in high dosage have been recommended if laryngeal and pulmonary oedema supervene but their value is unprovenendotracheal intubation or rarely tracheostomy may be required for lifethreatening laryngeal oedemacontaminated skin should be washed with copious amounts of waterskin lesions should be treated as thermal burns surgery may be required for deep burnsin the case of eye exposure the affected eyes shod eyes should be irrigated immediately and thoroughly with water or 09 saline for at least 1015 minutesinstillation of a local anaesthetic may reduce discomfort and assist more thorough decontamination
