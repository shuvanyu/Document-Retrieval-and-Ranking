over the last ten years curcumin has been reported to be effective against a wide variety of diseases and is characterized as having anticarcinogenic hepatoprotective thrombosuppressive cardioprotective antiarthritic and antiinfectious propertiesrecent studies performed in both vertebrate and invertebrate models have been conducted to determine whether curcumin was also neuroprotectivethe efficacy of curcumin in several preclinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases has created considerable excitement mainly due to its lack of toxicity and low costthis suggests that curcumin could be a worthy candidate for nutraceutical interventionsince aging is a common risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases it is possible that some compounds that target aging mechanisms could also prevent these kinds of diseasesone potential mechanism to explain several of the general health benefits associated with curcumin is that it may prevent agingassociated changes in cellular proteins that lead to protein insolubility and aggregationthis loss in protein homeostasis is associated with several agerelated diseasesrecently curcumin has been found to help maintain protein homeostasis and extend lifespan in the model invertebrate caenorhabditis eleganshere we review the evidence from several animal models that curcumin improves healthspan by preventing or delaying the onset of various neurodegenerative diseases
