late preterm lp birth 34 07  36 67 weeks gestation accounts for nearly threefourths of all preterm births making this population a sizeable public health concernthe immature fetal development associated with lp delivery increases the risk of mortality and shortterm medical complicationswhich combination of maternal fetal or neonatal risk factors may be most critical has only recently begun to be addressed and whether lp births disruptive impact on brain development will exert adverse effects on neuropsychological functioning in childhood and adolescence has been understudiedearly data have shown a graded response with lp children often functioning better than very preterm children but worse than term children and with subtle intellectual and neuropsychological deficits in lp children compared with healthy children born at term gestational agefurther characterization of the neuropsychological profile is required and would be best accomplished through prospective longitudinal studiesmoreover since moderate and lp births result in disparate medical and psychological outcomes the common methodology of combining these participants into a single research cohort to assess risk and outcome should be reconsideredthe rapidly growing lp outcomes literature reinforces a critical principle fetal development occurs along a dynamic maturational continuum from conception to birth with each successive gestational day likely to improve overall outcome
