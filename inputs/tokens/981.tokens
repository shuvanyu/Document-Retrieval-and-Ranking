since 1991 the us department of agriculture usda has conducted annual surveys of pesticide residues in foods under the agricultural marketing services pesticide data program pdpto assess chemical residues in domestically marketed catfish products 1479 catfish samples were collected during the 20082010 pdpsa subset of 202 samples was analysed for 17 toxic polychlorinated dibenzopdioxins and furans pcddfsthe average pattern of the individual pcddf congener concentrations in the catfish was rather unique in that it had almost no measurable amounts of polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs but all pcdds were presentthis pattern was more dominant in the domestically produced catfish products than in the imported products chinataiwancomparison of the pattern to known sources of pcddfs showed strong similarities to the pattern of pcddfs found in kaolin clays which have often been used as anticaking agents in animal feedsto investigate whether catfish feeds may be the source of the pcddfs found in the catfish archived catfish feed data from a us food and drug administration usfda database were examinedin 61 out of 112 feed samples the pcdd concentrations were 50 times higher than the pcdf concentrations and resembled the pattern found in the catfish products and in clays mined in the southeastern united statesalthough the source of pcddfs in domestically marketed catfish products cannot be definitively established mined clay products used in feeds should be considered a likely source and given the wide concentration range of pcddfs that has been found in clays a critical control point for pcddfs entrance to the food supply
