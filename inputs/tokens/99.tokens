ionizing radiation of fruits and vegetables in the form of gamma rays or electron beams is effective in overcoming quarantine barriers in trade and prolonging shelf life but a void of information persists on ionizing radiation effects of vitamin profiles in individual foodsbabyleaf spinach from commercial cultivars flatleafed lazio and crinkledleaf samish was grown harvested and surface sanitized according to industry practicesbabyleaf spinach of each cultivar was packaged under air or n2 atmosphere representing industry practices then exposed to cesium137 gammaradiation at 00 05 10 15 or 20 kgyfollowing irradiation leaf tissues were assayed for vitamin c e k b9 and carotenoid luteinzeaxanthin neoxanthin violoxanthin and betacarotene concentrationsatmospheres by irradiation had little consistent effect but n2 versus air was associated with elevated dihydroascorbic acid levelsfour phytonutrients vitamins b9 e and k and neoxanthin exhibited little or no change in concentration with increasing doses of irradiationhowever total ascorbic acid vitamin c free ascorbic acid luteinzeaxanthin violaxanthin and betacarotene all were significantly reduced at 20 kgy and depending on cultivar were affected at lesser doses of 05 and 15 kgydihydroascorbic acid the most affected compound and an indicator of stress likely due to irradiationgenerated oxidative radicals increased with increasing irradiation doses 05 kgy
