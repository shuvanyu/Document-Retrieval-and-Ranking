methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa is a major global public health concern and could be a food safety issuerecurrent reports have documented that pig herds are an important reservoir for mrsa specifically the livestockassociated sequence type 398the high prevalence of mrsa in pig primary production facilities and the frequent detection of mrsa of the same types in pork and pig meat products raise the question of underlying mechanisms behind the introduction and transmission of mrsa along the pork production chaina comprehensive review of current literature on the worldwide presence of livestockassociated mrsa in various steps of the pork production chain revealed that the slaughter process plays a decisive role in mrsa transmission from farm to forksuperficial heat treatments such as scalding and flaming during the slaughter process can significantly reduce the burden of mrsa on the carcasseshowever recontamination with mrsa might occur via surface treating machinery as a result of fecal contamination at evisceration or via increased human handling during meat processingby optimizing processes for carcass decontamination and avoiding recontamination by effective cleaning and personal hygiene management transmission of mrsa from pig to pork can be minimized
