enterobacterial strains producing clavulanicacidinhibited extendedspectrum Î²lactamases esbls are increasingly reported worldwideconventional detection of esbl production remains timeconsuming 24 to 48 htherefore the esbl ndp nordmanndortetpoirel test was developed for a rapid identification of esbls in enterobacteriaceaethis biochemical test was based on the in vitro detection of a cephalosporin cefotaxime hydrolysis that is inhibited by tazobactam additionthe esbl activity was evidenced by a color change red to yellow of a ph indicator red phenol due to carboxylacid formation resulting from cefotaxime hydrolysis that was reversed by addition of tazobactam positive testthe esbl ndp test was applied to cultured strains 215 esbl producers and 40 esbl nonproducersits sensitivity and specificity were 926 and 100 respectivelyits sensitivity 100 was excellent for detection of ctxm producersa few esbl producers n  16 that remained susceptible to cefotaxime were not detectedthe test was also evaluated on spiked blood cultures and showed excellent sensitivity and specificity 100 for boththe test was rapid less than 1 h and costeffectiveit can be implemented in any health care facility and is well adapted for infection control purposes in particular
