background the optimal target range for blood glucose in critically ill patients remains unclearmethods within 24 hours after admission to an intensive care unit icu adults who were expected to require treatment in the icu on 3 or more consecutive days were randomly assigned to undergo either intensive glucose control with a target blood glucose range of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter 45 to 60 mmol per liter or conventional glucose control with a target of 180 mg or less per deciliter 100 mmol or less per literwe defined the primary end point as death from any cause within 90 days after randomizationresults of the 6104 patients who underwent randomization 3054 were assigned to undergo intensive control and 3050 to undergo conventional control data with regard to the primary outcome at day 90 were available for 3010 and 3012 patients respectivelythe two groups had similar characteristics at baselinea total of 829 patients 275 in the intensivecontrol group and 751 249 in the conventionalcontrol group died odds ratio for intensive control 114 95 confidence interval 102 to 128 p002the treatment effect did not differ significantly between operative surgical patients and nonoperative medical patients odds ratio for death in the intensivecontrol group 131 and 107 respectively p010severe hypoglycemia blood glucose level  or  40 mg per deciliter 22 mmol per liter was reported in 206 of 3016 patients 68 in the intensivecontrol group and 15 of 3014 05 in the conventionalcontrol group p0001there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in the median number of days in the icu p084 or hospital p086 or the median number of days of mechanical ventilation p056 or renalreplacement therapy p039conclusions in this large international randomized trial we found that intensive glucose control increased mortality among adults in the icu a blood glucose target of 180 mg or less per deciliter resulted in lower mortality than did a target of 81 to 108 mg per deciliterclinicaltrialsgov number nct002209872009 massachusetts medical society
